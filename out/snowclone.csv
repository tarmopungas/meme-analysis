https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/where-is-your-god-now,https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/001/851/Screenshot_4.jpg,"""Where Is Your God Now?"" is a popular catchphrase often used as a caption for cursed or menacing images or pictures that depict something defying the normal order of things. The meme originates from a viral YTMND page of the King from Burger King advertisements in the 2000s. The phrase has also been repurposed as the ""Where Is Your X Now?"" snowclone.","The slightly altered version of the phrase appears in verse 7:10 of the Book of Micah of the Old Testament (seen below).[1] Then my enemy will see, and shame will cover her who said to me, “Where is the LORD your God?” My eyes will look upon her; now she will be trampled down like the mire of the streets. The phrase ""Where Is the Lord your God?"" is generally interpreted as ""the enemy"" (the Chaldean) luring the city of Jerusalem into questioning its faith in Jehovah when Jehovah did not aid the city as it was attacked by the Chaldeans.[2][3] Versions of the phrase also appear in the Bible, in Torah and in a number of Psalms, typically said by Israel's enemies to the people of Israel about their God (shown below).[4] My tears have been my food day and night, while they continually say to me, “Where is your God?” (Psalm 42:1-3) He will say: Where are their gods, their rock in whom they trusted, which ate the fat of their sacrifices and drank the wine of their drink offerings? (Deuteronomy 32:36-38) In October 2004, a Burger King commercial called ""Wake Up for With Burger King"" premiered in the U.S. (shown below). In the commercial, a man wakes up to find The Burger King lying next to him and staring at him. On March 28th, 2005, YTMBD[5] user ilpadrino created a YTMND titled ""WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW?"" that featured a still image of The Burger King staring at the man, captioned with the phrase. The page received nearly 80,000 views in 16 years (still image shown below).","['catchphrase', 'where is your god now', 'snowclone', 'bible', 'demotivational poster', 'god', 'phrase', 'ytmnd']",2005,2021-05-09,['catchphrase']

The memetic phrase was turned into a series of MS Paint comics on 4chan in which these players interrupt other events. The phrase is commonly edited through the snowclone ""No X, Y Only, Final Destination!""","In competitive Super Smash Bros. Melee, common tournament tier lists regularly rank the character Fox McCloud as the top rank, currently occupying his own special rank of SS over the 25 other characters.[1] This is commonly attributed to Fox's high levels of versatility and speed, and is commonly proven to be a ""jack of all trades, master of many."" This makes Fox a very popular character among tournament players, making high level tournament play include an overabundance of Fox, oftentimes creating an impression that Fox is the only character allowed to be played. In competitive tournament play, the focus on skill over random chance and environmental exploitation oftentimes leads players to turn off randomly spawning items and impose self restrictions on many stages that provide any form of significant hazard banned from being played at events due to the unbalanced nature of the game. One of the most balanced stages in the game is Final Destination, which is simply a flat panel. These rules commonly leak into Casual Play, where open Stage Selection and Items are normally welcome, creating tension between the casual and tournament player.","['final destination', 'super smash bros', 'fox', 'comic']",2007,2021-01-09,['pop-culture-reference']
