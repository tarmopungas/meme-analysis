Though the expanding brain is usually implied to showcase intellectual superiority over various objects, it is more often used in an ironic sense to imply the opposite, where objects of derision are implied to be of higher standard than objects that are usually highly regarded. For example, when used with Whomst, a person who uses ""who"" will be shown with the smallest brain, while a person who uses the most ridiculous variation, i.e. ""whomst'd've"", will be shown with the largest brain."	https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/galaxy-brain
