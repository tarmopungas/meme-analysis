While the phrase is rumored to have originated on 4chan, its earliest archived use in an online discussion board was posted on the gaming enthusiast NeoGAF[2] forums by member Mr Jared on October 21st, 2005. In the thread, Mr Jared expressed his approval of a Japanese adult video (JAV) for the console video game series Rumble Roses by saying "This is relevant to my interests." According to an Urban Dictionary[1] submission by user Brother Laz, the word "ROFLcopter" originated in a web forum for the online strategy game Warcraft III as a slang term for the gyrocopter flying machine unit, which were often mass produced by players for trolling purposes. On January 11th, 2004, the earliest known use of the term was posted by user SteniS in a thread on the Inc Gamers Warcraft III forum[3] about strategies against various Warcraft III units. A Wikipedia[5] entry for "Roflcopter" by user Grue claims that the term originated on the flash website Newgrounds, but does not provide a citation as evidence. The picture was originally a Myspace photo of one Rich Owens[1], of Silver Spring, Maryland (shown below). On February 24th, 2006, Davezilla.com linked to Owens' Myspace[2]. Owens is the co-owner of Full Force Entertainment. The exploitable saw a viral takeoff in late 2006 after the photo surfaced on the internet. "Bitches Don't Know Bout My Dick" was a phrase coined by music composer and producer BlingBling, in his short 2004 song entitled "Bitches Don't Know" (though it appears to have dropped off the face of the internet). The song was created to parody the lyrics typically found in most gangsta rap and crunk music at the time. On September 10, 2007, Chris Crocker uploaded a monologue performance, in which he made a plea to the media and the general public to cease hounding pop star Britney Spears (copy shown below).[1] In the video, Chris made a fake emotional storm in response to the amount of negative attention Britney had been receiving during the time leading up to and after her comeback performance at the 2007 MTV Music Awards. The video gained over 2 million views in the first twenty four hours,[2] and as of March 26, 2012, has acquired more than 43 million views. His YouTube account has since been shutdown but copies of the video still exist. The original “O RLY?” Snowy Owl image macro used a photo taken by nature photographer John White, which was subsequently posted to a Usenet newsgroup named alt.binaries.pictures.animals[1] on February 17th, 2001. White has since sent numerous cease and desist letters[2] to those using the image without his permission. The deadpan response "O RLY" originates from circa 2003 on the Something Awful forums, where it was used as a deadpan response to anything you found doubtful, unimpressive or just plain dull. The earliest documented use of the phrase "O RLY" can be found in a thread[5] posted on August 20th, 2003. All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. :lol: o rly? Best essay ever. - Fantastipotamus The song was first performed as a sketch on the Japanese sketch comedy show Adventures of a Laughing Dog (笑う犬の冒険 Warau Inu no Bōken?), known as Silly Go Lucky in the United States, where Happa-tai is portrayed by some of Japan's most well-known comedians.The sketch satirizes many of the stereotypes of Japanese pop culture, including such tropes as a romantic interlude during the song's bridge that takes place on a city street filled with floating sakura blossoms. The origin of the meme is unknown. The earliest recorded version dates back to the 1938 Cole Porter musical Leave It To Me! In the show, a man attempts to tip a messenger. The messenger refuses. "No tipping," he says. "In Soviet Russia, messenger tips you."[1] Domo-Kun (どーもくん Dōmo-kun) was initially the official mascot of Japanese television station NHK[1] (日本放送協会, Nippon Hōsō Kyōkai). The station introduced the character in December 1998[2] with several stop-motion sketches made to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the station being on air. Created and animated by Tsuneo Gōda[3], Domo was formed out of sketches of shapes while Gōda was brainstorming for a mascot. The character received its name from the announceer's introduction to the second airing of the animation: "dōmo, konnichiwa" (どうも、こんにちは?), which roughly translates to "Well, hello there!"[2] On May 31st, 2007, ten-year-old Jonathan Ware was visiting the Rose Festival in Portland, Oregon. During his visit to the fair, Jonathan had his face painted to look like a Zombie and was approached by the KGW local news correspondent Nancy Francis. When asked to comment about his face paint on camera, Jonathan tersely responded "I like turtles." A copy of the KGW newscast was uploaded online ten days after the broadcast by YouTuber 3mediapro, who seemed to have recognized early on that such moment of on-air awkwardness was too valuable to let slip away. In 1987, Liberty Medical signed Wilford Brimley to be the television spokesperson for the company.[1] Between 1987 and Brimley's death in 2020, the actor appeared in numerous commercials for the company, pronouncing the word "diabetes" in his signature southern droll (shown below). On November 2nd, 2002, Raza recorded an 8mm movie of himself pretend-fighting with a club in his high school studio, but forgot to take the cassette tape home with him. Unbeknownst to Raza, the footage was eventually discovered by three of his classmates and posted online via Kazaa, a popular P2P file-sharing network, on April 14th, 2003.[14] The oddball phrase "A Winner is You" actually stems from the 1986 NES game Pro Wrestling[1], wherein the player was given a short congratulatory message after beating the match opponent. Similar to other poorly translated videogame messages, its broken English grammar certainly stuck with those who've seen it and continues to be celebrated today. Between 1985 and 1987, the G.I. Joe animated series[2] aired on television, featuring a public service announcement at the end of each episode, closing with the quote “now you know, and knowing is half the battle.”[4][5] In 2003, Eric Fensler began dubbing over the original audio, beginning with a PSA about a child getting separated from his parents at a carnival.(shown below, left) Overall, 25 PSAs were made featuring nonsensical dialogue about porkchop sandwiches, body massages (shown below, right) and computers, among other absurd topics. While they were originally passed around via VHS tapes, his art gallery website and his personal website.  The prairie dog was first introduced in Episode 7 of Hello Morning! show in the segment known as "Mini Moni Chicca"[2] in which a group of J-Pop idols presented a number of cute pet animals like bunnies, turtles among others: On June 6th, 2007, YouTube user magnets99[3] uploaded a clip titled "Dramatic Look" featuring the footage of prairie dog from the Japanese TV show, set to a sample audio taken from the score of the 1974 film Young Frankenstein arranged by John Morris. As of May 2011, this instance alone has over 30 million views. On June 19th, the same clip was re-uploaded by another YouTuber user cregets[4]. As of May 2011, the duplicate video has over 29 million views. The phrase “One does not simply walk into Mordor” originates from a scene in Peter Jackson’s 2001 film adaption of J.R.R. Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.[1] In the scene, the Council of Elrond reveals that an evil ring must be destroyed by being thrown into the fires of Mount Doom, a volcano deep in the territory of Mordor. Boromir promptly points out the difficultly of the task by saying, “One does not simply walk into Mordor." In the "One does not simply X into Mordor" snowclone, the word “walk” is typically substituted with another verb which is often related to the subject of an image. The variation "One dos not simply walk into Y", swaps “Mordor” with another location that has relevance to the situation depicted in the image. One of the first instances of this usage in image macro form was posted in a Something Awful[2] thread with the caption "One does not simply / drive into Mordor" on January 16th, 2004.  On December 19th, 2001, the epic fantasy film The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring premiered in the U.S.[5] In the film, the characters Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli agree to assist the hobbits Frodo and Sam in their quest to deliver the Ring of Power to Mount Doom in order to destroy it. The characters offer their weapons in turn, pledging their allegiance (scene shown below). - If by my life or death I can protect you, I will. You have my sword! - And you have my bow! - And my axe! On June 6th, 2005, YTMND user zeronspoonx[1] made the earliest known viral meme based on the quote. In the YTMND post, a flashing image macro of Gimli is set to "Heroes to Us" by Kalmah and captioned "And you shall have my axe!!!" The page received over 27,900 views in 16 years, maintaining an average score of 3.95.   Roger Chan, a 51-year old unemployed man, and Elvis Ho, a real estate agent 28 years Chan's junior, were complete strangers before the… incident. On April 27, 2006, Ho tapped Chan's shoulder on a Hong Kong bus and Chan flipped the hell out. And, of course, it was all captured on a cellphone camera: Can't speak Chinese? Enjoy these subtitles: This tirade spread widely and the video became one of the most popular in May 2006, and now has over 4M video views. Chan was made into something of a hero to the people of Hong Kong. His frank and honest way of speaking in a town where people don't typically socialize with strangers. It noteworthy that Chan suffers from 'intermittent explosive disorder', AKA 'road rage' The code first appeared in the 1986 release of Gradius for NES (Nintendo Entertainment System).[1] Created by programmer Kazuhisa Hasimoto, it was implemented as a dev tool as Hasimoto could not get past a part of the game, being quoted as saying "Because I was the one who was going to be using it, I made sure it was easy to remember." Later, the code was programmed into many Konami and Non-Konami games. The most popular use of the code was in the video game Contra,[2] a two player shooter also for the NES. In Contra, use of the code granted thirty additional lives, dubbing it the "30 lives code". There are many variations of the code, used in many games. The code itself is: (↑) (↑) (↓) (↓) (←) (→) (←) (→) (B) (A) (START) In 2003, Eli appeared on the Chamblee High School freestyle rap program "Iron Mic" to engage in a rap battle against fellow amateur rapper "Envy." Eli's stunned expressions, lyrics like "I'm the best mayne- I diiid it", and long pauses made his performance rather memorable. The battle ended in a 2-1 decision resulting in a win for Envy.  According to the Lurkmore Wiki[3], Rule 34 originated from a comic posted on the website Zoom-Out[4], which was cached by Google as early as October 5th, 2004. In May of 2009, Something Awful[5] user Electric Eggs posted a thread titled “Ask me about inventing Rule 34”, in which he claimed to have created the comic with his sister after learning the adage in an IRC chatroom.   At Sony's press conference at E3 2009 held on June 2nd, Kazunouri Yamauchi, the CEO of Polyphony Digita gave a presentation for an upcoming Gran Turismo title for PlayStation Portable. Yamauchi was accompanied by an interpreter who opted to read his hand-written translations from a notepad, rather than the conventional real-time translation that is more commonly used during press conferences. Sony's press conference was held at the Sony Pictures Studio in Culver City on May 8th, 2006. Some of the main highlights included the announcement of long-awaited PlayStation3 console (its retail suggested price at $599), the six-axis controller and numerous upcoming titles for PS3 and PSP. Among the video games introduced was Genji: Days of the Blade[1], an action game based on historical facts of Japan. The presentation was hosted by Sony's CEO Kazuo Hirai and one of the lead producers Bill Ritch, who at point claimed that Genji 2's epic battle scenes were based on "famous battles which actually took place in ancient Japan." Almost instantly following Ritch's description of background, the gameplay footage began playing onscreen which depicted a mid-level boss known as a "giant enemy crab." Some of the other notable quotes from the presentation included "$599," the exorbitant retail price quoted for PS3 console, as well as gameplay descriptions like "you attack its weak point for massive damage" and "real-time… weapon change," which were ridiculed for their utter lack of notability (these features have been available since the classic 1980s games like Metroid). The earliest known mention of December 21st, 2012 has been attributed to author Michael D. Coe who wrote in his 1966 book The Maya: "There is a suggestion […] that Armageddon would overtake the degenerate peoples of the world and all creation on the final day of the 13th b'ak'tun. Thus […] our present universe [would] be annihilated [in December 2012] when the Great Cycle of the Long Count reaches completion." Coe's interpretation is largely based on the ancient Mayan Long Count Calendar, which is scheduled to complete its 5,125-year Great Cycle on the winter solstice in December 2012. According to the Popul Vuh, a compilation of Mayan mythical and historical narratives, three previous, failed worlds were abolished at the end of each of the previous three Great Cycles.[3] Thus, Coe inferred that at the end of the current Great Cycle in December 2012, an event of apocalyptic or transformative nature will occur. There are a multitude of competing theories as to exactly what will happen: some say that an interplanetary alignment will cause a series of catastrophic events, while others predict an incredible sign that will mark the beginning of a new Age. This doomsday interpretation has been dismissed by most Mayan scholars. On June 15, 2006, the first illustration of the super deformed version of Tusuya named Churuya-san was posted to eretto's web page Utsra Uraraka. Two days later, he posted the first 4-pane comic for people who rejoiced at his Churuya-san illust.[3] Her name, Churuya-san, sounds like childish mispronunciation of Tsuruya for Japanese sensibilities. The original image came from the website for The Worlds Largest Dinosaur, a large sculpture located in Drumheller, Alberta. Located in the Fun Stuff section, the photo was titled "A prime example of TOO MUCH time at the World's Largest Dinosaur."[1] The first version of the image posted to 4chan featured the caption "I'll suck your cock!" and was posted sometime around June 2004[4]. Threads featuring the Cockmongler soon started appearing, with several even being archived due to notableness.[5]  On December 16th, 1995, episode eight "The Medium Is the Message" of the animated series Street Fighter, an adaptation of Street Fighter fighting video game franchise, premiered.[1] In one scene of the episode, antagonist M. Bison is watching a fight between characters Guile, Chun-Li and Blanka and M. Bison's mutant combatants, with Guile and his allies apparently losing. Happy with this development, M. Bison smiles, exclaims "Yes! Yes!" and pumps his fist (scene shown below, right). An short upbeat tune plays while he celebrates. - This is delicious! - Guess you won't be needing those tapes I made for you. You want me to get rid of them? - Don't be hasty. Nothing I see those Street Fighters pummeled to dust. Which should be any moment now… Yes! Yes! On May 6th, 2007, YouTuber[2] Youpooper (also know as Rioting Soul) posted a YouTube Poop based on the clip, titled "Madness is delicious." The video (shown below) received over 103,800 views in fourteen years. The term "Sleeveface" was coined in April 2007 by Welsh DJ Carl Morris after pictures were taken of him and his friends holding record sleeves to their faces while Djing at a bar in Cardiff, UK. His friend John Rostron subsequently posted the images online and created a group on Facebook, where it turned into a popular craze. The official Sleeveface blog[1] was launched by Morris and Rostron on January 21st, 2008 and the instructional YouTube video on "How to make a sleeveface" was uploaded on February 3rd, 2008. The original VHS footage of Fatso was recorded by performance artist Charlie Schmidt in 1984. He put the cat in a shirt belonging to his son Cody and manipulated his paws to make the cat appear to be playing the keyboard. On June 7th, 2007, Schmidt uploaded the video to his YouTube channel[2], originally titled "Cool Cat" where it sat in relative obscurity for another two years. On February 2nd, 2009, YouTuber / blogger Brad O'Farrell[3] posted a mashup video of a man falling down an escalator[4] with Schmidt's cat, entitled "Play him off, Keyboard Cat." The idea of "playing someone off" came from the trope of "giving someone the hook"[5] for a bad performance, a technique from Vaudeville shows.[6] The original video has since been taken down from the original channel, but has been reuploaded by other users.[7] According to The Guardian's report, the original video was in fact produced decades ago and the cat died in 1987.    On January 20th, 2004, Apple Insider user SpcMs[2] started a thread[1] asking where he could download RAM for his computer. He claimed his computer was low on memory and he wanted to illegally acquire more. Within three minutes, another user responded saying that it cannot be downloaded as RAM is a physical thing, providing two links to retail websites to purchase additional RAM.    On July 1st, 2008, simulation / visual novel video game Trauma Center: Under the Knife 2 was released in the United States.[1] The game's soundtrack featured the song Gentle Breeze (やさしい風) by composers Manabu Namiki and Noriyuki Kamikura (shown below). At some point between the release of the game and September 22nd, 2008, YouTuber ChristopherCooler uploaded a ten-second clip based on a still image of SpongeBob SquarePants characters Squidward and Mr. Krabs standing next to each other, with the image being flipped, mirrored, distorted and otherwise altered to the beat of the song. While the original video is no longer available, reuploads by YouTube users McNibbler[2] (shown below, left) and Official Overwatch[3] (shown below, right) received over and 15,900 and 25,600 views in ten years. On October 30th, 2007, Sony released the DVD of the film Spider-Man 3. In the bloopers reel for the film, a montage of Maguire making funny faces features the frame used in the meme. On March 16th, 2009, NikeTalk[1] PhillyPG1 reportedly posted the earliest known usage of the face. However, the image is no longer available. On the 3rd of December, 2007 an Anonymous 4chan user on /b/ made a thread with the image of Master Chief from the popular game series Halo, saying [1] I think Halo is a pretty cool guy. Eh kills aleins and doesnt afraid of anything. Replies to the thread consisted of criticism of the poster's grammar and spelling and posted their own versions involving other things. On August 18th, 2005, artist Erwin Beekveld submitted a video titled "They're Taking The Hobbits To Isengard" to the flash website Albino Blacksheep[1] (shown below). The video featured scenes from the second Lord of the Rings film accompanied by a music track made from the line "They're taking the hobbits to Isengard!" uttered by the character Legolas (played by Orlando Bloom). The phenomenon of posting train images began as early as December 2006[13], largely in reaction to the heavy influx of furry porn threads on 4chan's /b/ (random) board in honor of Furry Fridays, a 4chan tradition that had been around since 2005. At the time, anon posters felt that furries did not belong on /b/[10], who was considered it a random board for anime and Japanese culture. Because of this, any Furry thread would end up flooded with photos of the Amtrak locomotive.[11] According to the Good Times FAQ[1] page, the first claim of its sighting dates as far back as April or May 1994, but the earliest known version of the e-mail was posted to the TECH-LAW mailing list by Rich Lavoie on November 15th, 1994. From there, it caught the attention of Rodney Knight, who forwarded the warning to the POSTCARD mailing list. The original message read: In 1997, the hacker collective Cult of the Dead Cow claimed responsibility for the propagation of the "Good Times" virus scare, which was apparently conceived as a social experiment to "prove the gullibility of self-proclaimed "experts" on the Internet." The original comic was posted by graphic designer Bob Averill (a.k.a Lego_Robot) on the SomethingAwful forums sometime in 2007. Depicting a long-distance couple's argument over the phone, the comic strip served as a parody of TV commercials for Reese's Puffs cereal featuring the tagline "Candy?!… For breakfast? It's Reese's!" The popularity of the comic[1] prompted Averill to start his own webcomic series Lego Robot Comics, now known as Plastic Brick Automaton.[2] The detailed image of Krabs that is used in these videos appears for less than a second during a montage in the SpongeBob SquarePants episode "Jellyfish Hunter," aired September 28th, 2001,[4] during which SpongeBob catches jellyfish for Mr. Krabs, who constantly demands "more." The first instance of Moar Krabs on YouTube has since been removed. The oldest version still on YouTube was posted on December 4th, 2008, titled "MOAR KRABS RETURNS." It has since accumulated over 135,000 views, but has had mostly negative response with more than 250 dislikes and only a little more than 100 likes.[1] Shepard Fairey began creating street art as early as in 1989 with a viral campaign known as Andre the Giant Has a Posse,[2] which evolved into the OBEY[3] sticker campaign in the following year and has since appeared in numerous locations all over the world.[4] In October 2007, publicist Yosi Sergant suggested to Fairey that he make a piece of art in support of Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign. Fairey then used a photograph (shown below, right) from April 2006, taken by Associated Press freelance photographer Mannie Garcia[5] as the basis for his stenciled poster. The first image he created (shown below, right) had the word "Progress" centered underneath the portrait, with a small OBEY symbol placed inside of Obama's campaign logo. On September 8th, 1989, The Super Mario Bros, Super Show! aired the first episode of the Legend of Zelda animated series.[1] In the opening credits of the episode, the characters Link and Zelda (voiced by Jonathan Potts and Cyndy Preston, respectively) jump from a great height. Link lands safely on dry land, while Zelda falls into a lake. Treading water, she says, "Nice job, hero." Link responds, "Hey, excuse me, princess" (shown below). Link would go on to use the phrase throughout the show's run. On November 26th, 2004, YTMND [2] user sup3r-m4rio posted the earliest available meme usage of the phrase for a site that features the phrase in text and plays the audio from the series' opening. The post received more than 11,000 views in less than 20 years (screenshot below).  On the G8 summit, when the russian president Vladimir Putin held a press conference, some young activist stood up and started to throw out propaganda leaflets. This incident became very popular in the russian part of the Internet but that wasn't because of the young activist or Putin's surprised face – the reason was the man's strange eyes as he looked at the young activist when the activist took a seat, he received the name Glazastik (Big-eyed guy): The modern adaptation of British horror film The Wicker Man was directed by Neil Labute, starring Nicolas Cage and Ellen Burstyn. Released in September 2006, the film generally received poor reviews and yielded disappointing results at the Box Office. In the film, Nicholas Cage plays the main character of a policeman named Edward Malus. When Malus' young daughter goes missing, he embarks on an adventure to find her, which eventually leads to him finding a shallow grave holding nothing more than a burned doll. After discovering the doll, Malus repeatedly asks a local woman "How'd it get burned?" On August 25th, 2007, YouTuber Tylomeister uploaded a video titled "WHO BURNED NICK'S TOAST!?!" featuring a clip of the scene edited with Cage holding a piece of burnt toast on a plate (shown below).   The music video--featuring Seebach and his band having a good time with a group of tribal-clothed babes--first came to the spotlight at the Fantasia Film Festival in 2006[2], when DJ XL5 dubbed Prodigy's Smack My Bitch Up (watch on video gallery) over the original M/V footage.[3] The dub was a success and soon enough, remixes and dubbed renditions of Apache music video took on a life of its own on YouTube. Sonic 3D Blast is a video game in the Sonic the Hedgehog series, released in 1996 as the last Sonic game for the Sega Genesis console. The game featured an isometric perspective and 3D gameplay that differed from previous titles (Sonic had to destroy badniks to collect Flickies, and guide them all to a giant ring to proceed in each stage). A Sega Saturn port with enhanced graphics and a different soundtrack was also released. Here's how Sonic looks like in the Main Menu: On January 15, 2007, the first "Kleiner Hai" video was posted to YouTube. The video shows a young German woman, Alexandra Müller, performing an animated musical comedy of a little shark growing up and finally swallowing a girl, thus becoming a bad shark. The video went largely unnoticed for much of 2007. But beginning in December of 2007, searches for Kleiner Hai began piling up, and by June of 2008, the video has 2.5 million views. As of November, 2009, the video has over 10 million views.  The Critic[1] is an American animated series revolving around the life of film critic Jay Sherman, voiced by actor Jon Lovitz[2]. The Critic had 23 episodes produced, first broadcast on ABC in 1994, finishing its original run on FOX in 1995. The scene. On May 12th, 2008, Youtube Pooper Ophios[3] created the first video entitled “Filler #71519.”The number assigned to this fad seems to arbitrary apart from the idea that it has been assigned as a unique signifier, similar to the idea of labeling pictures of people with their heads in freezers with the number 241543903. This practice makes a meme easy to search for, but may hinder the fad's contagiousness since it lacks descriptiveness. This is an excerpt from YTMND: The first one to be popular is a gif featuring her kicking her shoe off into the street. In the anime, the shoe is carried off by a fast-moving truck. This sequence is often replaced by other outcomes, such as the falling shoe resulting in an exploding ship, a different vehicle picking up the shoe, or a hydrogen bomb. Other examples of the meme on YTMND: Here is the first third of the episode which previews the original kick performed 5:20 into the video.   The earliest known example of such image can be dated back to October 9th, 2006[1], when an image macro depicting the difference between Mormons and Ninjas was uploaded on the site MyConfinedSpace by a user tiki god. The anime series Lucky Star aired in Japan between April 8th and September 16th, 2007. The show's opening theme "Motteke! Sailor Fuku" is a typical "denpa music" style song composed by Satoru_Kōsaki[1], famous for writing several other songs for various anime shows and video games, including The iDOLM@STER and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. The theme was sung by Lucky Star voice actors Aya Hirano,[2] Emiri Katō,[3] Kaori Fukuhara[4] and Aya Endō.[5] Kyoto Animation also produced an animated dance for the song, similar to the Hare Hare Yukai dance from the anime The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. A portion of the dance was shown in the show's opening sequence (shown below, left) and the full version appeared in the last episode aired on September 16th, 2007 (shown below, right).   On October 17th, 2005, a page titled "AAAAAAAAA!" was created on Uncyclopedia,[1] featuring an entire article filled with the letter "A" (shown below). Similar to You must construct additional pylons! and In Ur Base, Zerg Rush came from StarCraft, a military science real time strategy game originally released on March 31st, 1998. In the game, each player can choose to play as one of the three species: Terran (humans), Protoss (humanoids) or Zerg (insectoids).  The term “Internet Hate Machine” was coined during a news story on Anonymous broadcast by Los Angeles Fox affiliate KTTV on July 26th 2007, which characterized the group as hackers, cyber bullies and "domestic terrorists.” The report also called the group “hackers on steroids” with an unrelated video clip of an exploding van as a depiction of Anonymous' real-life terrorism. A British advertisement first aired in June 2009, featuring an actor named Billy Wright, shouting WONGA! – British slang for "money", the word being uncommon and the appearance of the person saying it started a YouTube fad, sometimes compared to Girugamesh. Two of the original adverts: and The first remix seemed to have originated around August 2009, very shortly after the advert aired but the popularity seemed to really increase around January, and has been going up ever since. It has been used for YTPMVs, looped for long periods of time, Youtube Pooped, etc. Some of the many videos spawned by the advert can be found in the Videos box below. The graph shows the increase of Google searches for "Wonga" from June '09 onwards, and the searches very visibly pick up. There will have been searches for the definition long before the advert aired (visible at the start of the graph), but from July 2009, the searches began gradually increasing until January when the fad seemed to catch on. Created with the music software GarageBand[1], "Danjo" was written and recorded by Japanese musician Taro (太郎) and was released in Japan on December 13th, 2006. The song's premise relatively simple, where it follows a student, a teacher, and a student president deciding the seating arrangements of their class. The song remained mildly known until it was shared to Niconico a year later on December 2nd, 2007. On December 22nd, 2004, YouTuber SuperYoshi published what is considered by some to be the first YouTube Poop video under the title "Recycled Koopah." Two years later, on November 27th, 2006, SuperYoshi posted the video on YouTube with the title "I'D SAY HE'S HOT ON HOUR TRAIL." The video received more than 427,000 views in less than 15 years (shown below).  J-E-N-O-V-A is written by the Japanese video game composer Nobuo Uematsu.[2] This song was a battle theme that played when fighting one of the game's major antagonists, Jenova, a parasitic alien life-form. Meanwhile, probablly the first instance using this song in video remixes was a MAD video posted to NND in February 23rd, 2008.[3] This video entitled "C-R-A-S-H-E-R" was also one of derivatives of Angry German Kid. This video was quickly reuploaded to YouTube. Sometime during 1985, a man by the name of Stephen Malinowski (smalin on Youtube) along with his wife, Lisa Turetsky, invented the MAM as a means to help people read and play musical scores in a much simpler fashion compared to traditional sheet music. Malinowski continues to upload his latest MIDI animations (mainly of classical compositions) on his YouTube page. Here is an example of one of Stephen's MAM videos. The song of making a late night trip to a local 24 hour convenience store, "Konbini", was first included in their 3rd album "Our Extracts" (僕らのエキス) released in September 1999, and also released as their 6th single in November of that year. An official music video for this song was also aired on music channels (shown below, left). Meanwhile, the trigger of this hand-drawan animated video fad was posted to NND by user on February 16th, 2008 (shown below, right), which follows the story by featuring Touhou Project characters. Besides, the impressive defiant duck face in the latter part is a citation from Nijiura Seven, a famous flash animated video made in the Japanese anonymous imageboard community Futaba Channel (2chan) in 2005. The word was coined by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene (shown below). The book focused on the importance of self-replication in evolution and pointed to the gene as the unit of biological information that is subject to selection pressures.[1] He postulated that perhaps not only biological information undergoes natural selection and that anything that is capable of replicating itself would also be susceptible to selection pressures, like ideas and beliefs. The word "meme" was used to label this type of self-replicating cultural information, and it was derived from the Greek word mimema, which translates to "something imitated".   In 1993 a photographer named Matt Kenlon was sent to cover the Mississippi River Flooding. In November 1994 the photographer met a homeless man named William Todd in the town of Biloxi, Mississippi. Kenlon asked Todd if he could take some photos… the results: The photos were published in a coffee table book produced by McLaren Press in 1996 called "America's Refuse: Homeless in the Heartland." In 2001, the Something Awful forums began hosting a scanned version of one of the photos -- the one with the fierce, vaguely threatening stare, glowering through that intimidating hood: The words "You gonna get raped" were written on it. From this point onward, the man would become known as the "You're Gonna Get Raped Guy". In April 2008, a 20-second long video titled "Mereana Mordegard Glesgorv"[5] began to circulate on YouTube, which was originally uploaded by YouTuber erwilzei on April 18th, 2008: In the days following the original upload, a number of duplicate videos emerged on YouTube with alternative titles like "Mereana Moregard Glasgow" as well as an extended 2 minute version accompanied by a creepypasta story.  Though the man's identity is unknown, the photo was taken on March 23rd, 2003 outside of St. Louis, Missouri.[1] On that day, approximately 350 pro-peace activists got together with civilian weapons inspectors at the Boeing missile factory, asking to investigate the weapons of mass destruction being produced there. When they were denied access, the protestors sat in front of the main gate in protest. Approximately 75 pro-war supporters came to the factory with signs discouraging the sit-in. One of these supporters held the "Get a Brain Morans" sign. The photo was initially shared on the St. Louis Indymedia Center[2] in 2003. The vividness of mental images[17] in human brain has been studied by philosophers for centuries. While it is likely similar notions[6] about our visual memory had been made before, the earliest known usage of the phrase "cannot be unseen" on the web can be found in an inspiring quote by Canadian cartoonist David Sim[14], which read: "Once a profound truth has been seen, it cannot be 'unseen'." Sim's quote was cited in a number of blog posts[15] and essays throughout the early 2000s. However, its first iteration in the context of describing a traumatic experience can be attributed to a personal blog post about Goatse titled "Some Images, Once Seen, Cannot Be Unseen,"[16] written by Joey devIlla on December 15th, 2004.   Ellen Feiss is the 15 year old girl appearing in this Mac Switch ad from 2002: Nannerpuss first appeared in a commercial for the American chain restaurant Denny's, which aired during 2009's Super Bowl XLIII. Created by the Goodby, Silverstein & Partners agency[1], the ad was the first time[2] Denny's bought commercial time during the Super Bowl. A portmanteau of the words banana (nanner) and octopus (puss), Nannerpuss is supposed to represent a typical breakfast made for a child, and is juxtaposed against Denny’s Grand Slam meal, asking "isn't it time for a serious breakfast?" The commercial advertised a promotional event for a free Grand Slam breakfast on the following Tuesday of February 3rd, 2009. The broadcast of the ad reportedly brought an increase to Denny's website traffic by 1679%[3] and a turnout of two million people[4] to Denny’s restaurants for the free meal. Switch was an advertising campaign launched by Apple Computer (now Apple Inc.) on June 10, 2002. It featured what the company referred to as "real people" who had "switched" from the Microsoft Windows platform to the Mac. An international television and print ad campaign directed users to a website where various myths about the Mac platform were dispelled. (Source, wikipedia, see link) Diglett first appeared in Episode 31 of the Pokemon anime series titled Dig Those Diglett!, as a mythical Pokemon posing obstacles for the dam construction to protect the wild forest. It was also featured in Pokemon Red / Blue edition, the first installment of Pokemon video game franchise released in 1998. The small, pink-nosed Pokemon's signature skill is its ability to keep the body partially submerged below ground or to bury itself entirely, when necessary. While the character has made several appearances in the anime series and video games, the only thing known about its physique is that it has feet, as once mentioned in the Nintendo DS videogame Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team. One of the earliest discussions relating to the topic can be found in a PokemonElite2000 Forum[1] thread titled "The Ultimate Question: What does Diglett look like out of the ground!? GASP," originally posted on November 23rd, 2004. The thread generated over two dozens of responses, with many speculating that it would resemble a ground mammal with claws and feet, as suggested by its use of "scratch" move and the canonical fact that it has feet to move with.  The slap production began on June 9, 2008, with the first season being similar to college hazing routines, "where four daring students revisit the horrors of being bullied on the first day of college by surviving three quintessential Dadas in three rounds and compete against each other for a winning sum of Rs. 50,000 in cash." The four students basically had to endure abuse and Fear Factor-style stunts to win. That year, an episode Dadgiri: Beat the Bullies aired in September. In the episode, one of the bullies Esha told contestant Ravi Bhatia to "go fuck off." He responded, "You go." Angered, Esha made an unscripted slap across Ravi's face, and he responded with an unscripted slap across her face. The show crew appears from off the sides of the set and then began beating him up, all the while he yells his now-famous phrase, "HOW CAN SHE SLAP?!?" Ravi was later hospitalized (shown below). On May 6th, 1937, the German passenger airship the Hindenberg caught fire while attempting to dock at the Naval Air Station in Lakehurst, New Jersey.[1] Journalist Hebert Morrison reporting for the WLS radio station in Chicago was an eyewitness of the disaster. His comments were broadcast the following day. Later, newsreel footage of the disaster included Morrison's broadcast, creating the appearance that they were recorded together. THey were not. Morrison said: The origin of the meme is unkown. However, the earliest use of the phrase was published on the website for the Encyclopedia Britannica as the title of an article about manatees.[2] The following year, photoblogger Micahel Howden posted the phrase as the caption for a photograph of manatees skeleton (shown below, left). The earliest available usage of the meme was published on March 31st, 2006, by Flickr [3] Pedro Vera (shown below, right). They cite wormuniverse.com as the source for the image.[4]  This meme originated from the horror manga The Enigma of Amigara Fault by Junji Ito. The plot follows an earthquake which reveals several human-shaped holes on the side of a fault. As people travel to see the spectacle, they realize that the holes were specifically made for individual people. They then become hypnotized into going through their holes, emerging months later on the other side of the mountain, hideously deformed.   The System32 file originally appeared in Windows 2000[1]. As a trolling scheme, System32 is typically presented as a virus and instructions are given on how to delete it without prompting a warning message. While it is likely that "Delete system32" scheme has been circulating online since the early 2000s, the trick became a well-known trolling device through its usage on 4chan in late 2006. The Google Insights graph indicates the search queries for "Delete System32" began to spike circa December 2006. In 2007, YTMND users filibuster, omgbomb, and dmaz declared Ted Danson would be the newest fad. They produced many sites with Ted Danson using various pieces of music, but eventually the moon level track from the Ducktales game became the official theme of Ted Danson. Of the 166 YTMNDs, many were created by the same users Most other users created not just one, but multiple entries. While this meme is notable, it never truly broke out from being a forced fad.  Back in the first half of 2006, a young college student called Bilal Parkim (it appeared further on that his real name is Nabil Fekkar) decided to upload a video of himself on Youtube. It was an attempt as a rap song, completely home-made, in order to bash one of his Youtube friends. The result is this video: This video isn't from his account, so isn't the first actual one, for he took it down because of what will happen next. However, it's one of the earliest original video, dating from april 2006, to be upload by someone else. It has gathered about 2 500 000 views.  Articles containing screenshots and trailers on the new Prince of Persia movie that are posted on popular gaming blog Kotaku are where Kotaku commenters are quick to disregard Jake Gyllenhaal himself, and praise his abs, as having a starring role in the movie. This has also spawned a Facebook fan page dedicated to Jake Gyllenhaal's abs here. A facebook comment on Jake Gyllenhaal's abs. Can't wait for Prince of Persia….starring Jake Gyllenhaal's Abs, and guest-starring Jake Gyllenhaal. It's gonna be great.  Giovani recounts how the idea of tattooing a mustache on a finger came to him in the following Youtube video with Midwesterngoodness.  This simple concept of "manually copying text from one place and pasting it elsewhere" has been in practice since the innovation of basic text-editing commands (copy/cut/paste) in the early 1980s and subsequent rise of spamming in the early 1990s. In 1974, American computer scientist Larry Tesler, widely cited as the pioneer of "cut and paste" commands, first transferred the function into a computer text-editing software.[1] The origin of the term "copypasta" is unknown; although, some report to seeing the term on Usenet and 4chan imageboards in 2006. Urban Dictionary [2] posted the earliest available usage of the term on April 20th, 2006. User Elexus defined the term, "An amount of lengthy text that has been repeatedly copied from somewhere and pasted as a reply to an irrelevant subject." The post received more than 170 upvotes in less than 15 years (shown below).        The actual origin is believed to originate from former Gamesradar editor, Christian Nutt. Nutt, mimicking the N-Gage's awkward design, took a picture of him holding the N-Gage like a real phone. Starting July 14th, 2006, Martin Billany (screen-named LittleKuriboh)[2] released a condensed spoof of the popular anime Yu-Gi-Oh, titled Yu-Gi-Oh: The Abridged Series[3]. The series consisted in parodying the absurdity of the plot of Yu-Gi-Oh while using outside references. His dubbing talent gave great entertainment from an otaku to an audience which, for the most part, was basically unfamiliar with the show itself.   In December 2009, Facebook users began posting satirical status updates containing instructions on how to change various Facebook settings in response to new privacy policy changes[1] that allowed third party clients to access content and user information on the social networking service (shown below).   One of the earliest appearances of the phrase "Don't Worry, I'm from the Internet" was seen as a caption on a photo of a heavyset man dressed in military gear holding a gun. It was first referenced on the Ars Technica message board[3] in a discussion about cosplay in February 2005, with the original poster asking if anyone had remembered the photo. The image[1] (below left) was not seen again until December 15th, 2005, when it was posted on humor site My[confined]Space along with a similar photo[2], both using the caption.  Brazilian distributor and pornographer Marco Fiorito directed Hungry Bitches and his company MFX Media released the film on January 5th, 2007. Fiorito, a self-described "compulsive fetishist," came under fire from United States authorities, calling his films obscene. On his films, Fiorito said, "I have already made fetish movies with scat/feces using chocolate instead of feces. Many actors make scat films, but they don't agree to eat feces."[1] Months after the film's release, on August 12th, 2007, the website 2girls1cup.com launched. The site hosted the video until the site's deactivation. In 2005 a bunch GameFAQs users had an argument about what would happen to cars that smashed into various walls. One user argued that a car could take anything if it were made of diamond, unless of course if the wall were also made of diamond. He smugly informed his fellow GameFAQer that "Diamond is one of the hardest metals (If not THE hardest metal) known the man." [sic] The conversation was thus brought to a conclusion. The original comic is rumored to have been originally posted on 4chan's /v/ (video games) board, somewhere in 2007. It had later been posted on other game boards such as ones on Gamefaqs and Gamespot.    The audio track was originally recorded in 2003 as a class project by the American musician Dan Deacon[1], just talking about random things on TV channels in character of a stereotypical Long Islander. It was also featured on his 2003 release Meetle Mice. Years later in 2006, musician and M/V director Liam Lynch contacted Deacon and put together a short animation to go with it. The video was uploaded on October 11th, 2006 and has gained over 15 million views as of October 11th, 2011.   The term "Waifu" was first introduced to the English-speaking audiences through a scene from the popular high school anime series Azumanga Daioh, which aired in Japan from April to September 2002 and later released as a DVD set in the United States in September 2005. In the scene, the protagonist's perverted homeroom teacher Mr. Kimura drops a photograph of a mysterious woman on the classroom floor. When asked by his students about the person in the picture, Mr. Kimura simply replies: "Mai Waifu."    The abbreviation OP for “original poster” has been used since the mid 1990s in newsgroup discussions on Usenet. On December 31st, 2003, Urban Dictionary[4] user Joe submitted the first entry for the term “OP,” defining it as a common abbreviation used on message boards and forums. The earliest archived instance of the phrase “OP is a faggot” was posted on the /b/ (random) board via 4chan[5] on May 29th, 2007 (shown below).  Jingle All the Way is a Christmas family movie starring famous actor Arnold Schwarzenegger as Howard, a workaholic father struggling to appease his family for the holiday season. While running around town to find the perfect Christmas gift for his son, Howard (Arnold Schwarznegger) finds out his overly friendly neighbor Ted (Phil Hartman) is hanging out at Howard's home with his wife, eating fresh baked cookies. A funny discussion about cookies quickly ensues:  This is the Monty Python sketch to which the definition refers, where an old lady attempts to order food at a cafe, but does not like spam. Although spam is not actually included in every item on the menu, the frequent use of the word drowns out any options that do not include the word spam. Its online usage began in the early 90s with Usenet netizens who flooded IRC chatrooms and forums with the word "spam" in reference to the repetitive and unwanted presence of Spam in the sketch. This phenomenon has been reported in early Usenet discussion threads as well as court decisions handed down in lawsuits against spammers (ex: CompuServe Inc. v. Cyber Promotion in 1997).       On July 24th, 2009, YouTuber Gunjan Trivedi shared a video entitled "bUAAAAAA committing suicide." The post received more than 11,000 views in less than 11 years (shown below).     South Park is the satiric show that everyone knows, therefore giving perfect source for the lulz. The show had many offense lines but this one from the movie was one of the show's most famous.   壁砕き originated from the website Multilockon. The animation was created on December 7, 2003 using "EasyToon Setagaya Branch", an updated version of Keijiro Takahashi's "EasyToon", a program that is used to create short black and white animations. [Who was the artist?] Early examples of "Escalator Spin" videos began to surface on YouTube[1] sometime in July 2006. But, as one can see from the view counts and other statistics, these videos attracted relatively low viewcounts (less than 50,000 views for the most-viewed instance). Thanks to Jostin Asuncion - The original image was screenshotted from King of The Hill episode 9, season 12 – "Dream Weaver". The small scene begins when basket weavers tell a joke to Hank Hill about Dale Gribble's poor basket weaving. Hank began laughing and soon the reposed head of Hank Hill appeared in 13:15 into the video. In Japan, Can-Can is known as "Heaven and Hell" (Japanese : 天国と地獄, Tengoku to Jigoku), the translated title of that opéra bouffon in there. One of the most well-known usages of this music in Japan is BGM for sports days in schools. Almost all Japanese have participated in a footrace or a medley relay with this music in their school days. Because of this common life experience of Japanese people, like Mayim Mayim, Can-Can has been frequently cited in their pop culture since 1950s and has been produced many its remixes in CMs, animes and games. Among those remixes, the most popular Can-Can remix in online parodies comes from Jubeat, a Japanese rhythm action game produced by KONAMI in 2008. This remix was composed by Mutsuhiko Izumi, a Japanese musician.    The animated GIF comes from a clip taken from the sketch comedy TV series Wonder Showzen, which aired from 2005 to 2006 on MTV2,[1] in an animated sketch titled “Plastic Surgeons Without Borders.”[19] In the skit, a child is shown yelling “That’s racist!” at the camera immediately following the cartoon.  The image macros started from a picture of laughing Lady Gaga, with the caption "Yes, this pleases Gaga." The picture was taken during VMA Awards 2009 in New York, when Russell Brand made a joke about how unfair the popular, and tabloid media had been towards her.      Prior to One Letter Off, Something Awful held several different Photoshop Phriday contests that involved altering official movie posters. The first focused on editing classic movie posters and was posted on May 30th, 2002.[1] The original thread resulted in eighteen pages of images. There was no underlying theme to these photoshops, SomethingAwful users were encouraged to change as much or as little of the original they desired. The next Photoshop Phriday to include movie posters took place on April 10th, 2003.[2] This contest asked users to create Anagrammed Movie Posters, ones that would switch the letters of the original title around and then alter the poster to match the new title. On November 12th of that year, Fark[3] held a contest asking people to create mashup posters combining two or more movie titles. On February 10th, 2005, a thread titled "Change a letter in the movie title…"[4] was posted on the Australian tech forums, Whirlpool. While no images were posted in the thread, users provided descriptions of what the movies would be about. Approximately one month later on March 15th, a game thread[5] on the forums for syndicated newspaper advice column the Straight Dope[6] asked users to post movie titles missing a letter, drastically changing the movie's plot. The first photoshop contest version of these threads was posted on Worth1000[7] on September 8th, 2006, with over 100 submitted entries.      The Legend of Zelda CD-i (Compact Disk interactive) games were developed in late 1993 as a partnership between the Dutch electronics company Philips and the Japanese videogame publisher Nintendo to encourage production of CD-based games.[1] The CD-i games were produced without any quality control from Nintendo, allowing three of the worst video games ever to be produced under its brand: Zelda: Wand of Gamelon (Animation Magic, 1993), Link: The Faces of Evil (Animation Magic, 1993), and Zelda's Adventure (Viridis, 1994).[3] Animation Magic outsourced all of the cutscene animation to a firm in Russia, who also worked on I.M. Meen, another CD-i game commonly lampooned on YouTube.[4] Upon release, all of the Zelda CD-i games were criticized heavily for their bad gameplay, horrendous controls, confusing design, and ridiculous cartoon cutscenes.[5] These games are widely regarded as some of the worst of all time, evident by their bad reviews from Electronic Gaming Monthly and IGN.[6][7] Gametrailers.com regards Zelda: Wand of Gamelon as the "fifth worst game of all time."[8] The CD-i Zelda games have also been unofficially erased from Zelda canon by Nintendo. As a result, they are completely absent from any Nintendo publications, and they did not show up in the 2003 Legend of Zelda Collector's Edition,[11] which included essentially every Legend of Zelda game to date aside from the CD-i games. The early development of Zelda CD-i cutscene parodies on YouTube cannot be easily traced, but the original clip of the cutscene was first uploaded by YouTuber and YouTube Poop artist MasterAl on January 26th, 2006:   The song "Break My Stride" was released in 1983, where it reached number 5 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. It had been used in several commercials and was covered by dance group Unique II and German band Blue Lagoon. On February 26th, 2006, YTMND user syncan created the first Can't Break my Stride YTMND. It has been viewed over 130,000 times. In the scene, Earl, the protagonist of the series, is chased by a "no-legged man" after an encounter with the "no-legged" man's girlfriend. For more information on the episode and the series, see the episode guide. The interview segment on Maury originally aired in late 2007: Two years later, Alycia's notable pronunciation of "Chicken Tetrazinni" was put on spotlight again, when the clip was featured on The Soup, an entertainment round-up program on E! Channel: Since then, "Tetrazzini" has become the subject of several remixes and impersonations on YouTube and was honored by E! as the "Clip of the Year" on The Soup Clipdown 2009.  On December 31st, 2008, YouTuber[2] J16FOX2 uploaded a video titled, "Engineer havin' a good time" in which an Engineer character model from Team Fortress 2 with a comically dropped jaw bobs up and down (shown below). The video garnered over 21,000 views in 12 years. Although the word "vagineer" is not featured anywhere in the video, this is considered the origin of the character, which is the earliest known "TF2 Freak Character," a category of fan-made characters that appear in surreal and disturbing Garry's Mod and Source Filmmaker videos. The vagina-like face is made with the Garry's Mod Faceposer tool.[1] On April 19th, 2009, YouTuber[3] Bluebajs uploaded a video titled, "NEED DISPENSER RIGHT HERE" featuring an Engineer with a similar mouth to the one shown in J16FOX2's, although more closely resembling a vagina (shown below). Following this video, people began referring to the character as the Vagineer in following videos featuring the character, expanding on its lore. The video gained over 77,800 views in 11 years.    The 3D reboot of the 1981 fantasy adventure film Clash of the Titans inspired by the Greek myth of Perseus was released on April 2nd, 2010. Months prior to its release, Warner Bros. unveiled a two-minute long teaser trailer in which Liam Neeson's character Zeus orders his men to unleash the legendary squid-like sea monster by shouting "release the Kraken!" The trailer was uploaded onto YouTube by Hollywood Streams on February 18th, 2010, which has received more than 3 million views in three years. On March 22nd, 2010, Internet humor website Urlesque[1] posted an article about the upcoming release of Clash of the Titans, noting the ridiculous nature of Neeson's line in the teaser trailer. The article was accompanied by an image macro template featuring the screen capture of the scene and the quote, as well as an instruction for readers to create their own parodies using the template. The video was originally sent to several record labels, but rejected by all of them. The tape was allegedly placed in a box at an MTV studio and stayed there for 17 years until an employee uploaded it to Youtube. Then on October 1, 2006, the video was re-uploaded by Hazen himself on his own Youtube account.  On April 7th 2003, a topic named (strip) Star wars: ton univers impitoyableuhbeuhh was started on the Café Salé forum[3], a website community gathering artists from different media. This peculiar topic was made by forum user Gaijinsan in order to expose some of his drawings based on the 1999 Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace movie. On the 2nd of June, user Materiax posted the following picture: This, along with another picture in the post that follows, are taken from a personal website (now defunct)[4] used to upload artworks from a user called nadjika04. Because of the other forum users reactions to the post, it appears safe to assume that nadjika04 and Materiax are the same person. It was seen as a funny picture that gained some attention among users, but it wasn't until the 22nd of February 2004 that user Fox got the idea to modify the picture[5]. The result: He then continued to create more alterations. The thread began to gather attention centred around people making alterations from the initial picture. This thread has extended to 51 pages.   The origin of Cool Dog is unknown, with many of the earliest sites hosting it now unavailable. One of the earliest remaining uploads of the image was uploaded to sguenis.blogspot.com[2] by Cristal on November 5th, 2008. Another early example exists on old.marcofolio.net[1] in a post titled, "[Imagedump] November 2008." On January 22nd of 2006, YTMND user Syncan uploaded his site Chunk Is Indestructible, which now has more than one million views. The first part of the gif is composed of a scene where Patrick Stewart is shooting a gun, from the movie Star Trek: First Contact. Stewart was already popular on YTMND, known for his role in Star Trek: The Next Generation as Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the U.S.S. Enterprise. His place in YTMND history was further solidified with the Picard Song – an enormously popular site – in 2004. By 2006, he was incredibly popular on YTMND, and many sites used him for any reason at all. This site is an amazingly popular example of Jean-Luc's YTMND fad. The second part of the gif used is a scene from the movie The Goonies in which the character Chunk does the "Truffle Shuffle". The dance was already prevalent prior to the fad. The song used in the original YTMND is "Feuer Frei" by the German band Rammstein, from their album Mutter. This is one of their most-bought songs on iTunes. The title of the song fits well with the gif, as it means "Open Fire!" in English. The single of the song peaked in Germany at 33, and in the United Kingdom at 35.       In the 2007 Michael Bay's comics-based blockbuster Transformers, American actor/comedian Anthony Anderson plays the role of expert hacker Glen Whitmann, delivering many one-liners over the course of the movie. In one scene, Maggie Madsen (Rachael Taylor) visits Glen. Glen's grandmother shouts from another room to see who has stopped by, to which he responds "SHUT UP GRANDMA!" then "Grandmama drink your prune juice!" The scene has become a popular source material used in a number of YouTube Poops and Garry's Mod videos. Monster Hunter Freedom Unit is a 2008 video game in the Monster Hunter franchise for PlayStation Portable.[2] It is an expansion pack for the original Monster Hunter Freedom 2, and was released on March 27, 2008 in Japan as Monster Hunter Portable 2nd G (モンスターハンターポータブル 2nd G, Monsutā hantā pōtaburu 2nd G).[3] During the data installation step, an option that increases game performance by shortening in-game loading times, a peculiar animation of cats (Felynes[4] from the game) can be seen while a music composed of looping squeak! squeak! squeak! meow! sounds is played. According to an unconfirmed tip from Todd Bushman, who claims that the studio portrait was taken of him as a baby in December 1977, the image was first uploaded online via his Facebook profile in September 2008. However, the photograph remained hidden from public view until he decided to submit it to the awkward family photo-style blog Sexy People[1] sometime in 2009 (shown below). On March 31st, 2010. 4chan founder Christopher Poole temporarily changed the name of the /v/ (video games) board to "Babby," set the background image to the chubby baby photograph and looped the 2009 K-pop song "Gee" by Girls' Generation in the background.    In the early '90s, the Placer County SPCA made this video to showcase one of its homeless animals, a cat named Pinky. Just as the SPCA employee calls Pinky a "very loving cat," Pinky jumps out of his arms and begins to freak out, flopping around before attacking the employee. According to Wikipedia, clips of the original video aired on three different clip shows on American television between 1993 and 1996: TV's Funniest Commercials, Real Funny hosted by Craig Shoemaker, and The World's Most Dangerous Animals III. The video was uploaded to YouTube on November 5, 2005. On June 28, 2006, the NBC Nightly News featured the video in a segment called YouTube, don't you?. It appears around 2:06. The segment was followed up with a blog post on the Nightly News' website in which senior producer Gena Fitzgerald tried to track Pinky down. Fitzgerald posted that she had called the SPCA to find out Pinky's whereabouts but she never followed up. Over the years, many people have named the video as a favorite, including Simpsons creator Matt Groening in 2007 and Conan O'Brien in 2010.  On April 29th, 2008, action-adventure video game Grand Theft Auto IV was released.[1] In the game, character Roman Bellic, the cousin of the main protagonist Niko Bellic, is introduced. Roman[2] is a friend character who the player can spend time together engaging in various optional activities, such as dining, drinking or playing various mini-games. At times, Roman will call Niko and invite him to spend time together, with bowling being one of the options. Niko, it's Roman! Let's go bowling!        The original photograph of the suit-wearing black man (shown below, left) can be found on the stock photo website ShutterStock[2] under the title "Handsome African American business man dressed in a black suit." According to an anonymous e-mail sent to Know Your Meme staff from the creator of the image macro series, the idea was first inspired by reverse-discrimination discussions at work. Both the template (shown below, right) and original instances were first submitted in several threads on the imageboard 4chan before a page was made on the image macro creation website Meme Generator[1] in 2010. In 2001, the Spongebob Squarepants episode "Shanghaied" aired. In it, the line was first used.  In preparation for the release of Toy Story 3, Disney released a customizable comic template for visitors of their site to use. However, in typical 4chan fashion, what was once meant to be an innocent pastime for bored 10-year-olds soon erupted with profanity and meme-laced abominations, featuring favorite Toy Story Characters. The unfortunate Disney page     On June 7th, 2008, YouTube user Betoduda uploaded a video of Grace Kelly, a flamboyantly gay teenager from João Pessoa, Brazil. When asked what he did the night previous, he responded "Só no CAC do Rangel, com os traficanti! ATÓRON, ATÓRON PERIGÓN!" Loosely translated, this means, "I was in Rangel's CAC*, with the drug dealers! I love, I love danger!" CAC is the name given to nightclubs in João Pessoa that tend to have a bad reputation. The original video has 1.2 million views. Amost exactly a year later on June 1, 2009, user galega07 uploaded the subtitled version. This currently has 387,000+ views The photographs of Jobs and Gates having a conversation were taken during a panel session hosted by All Things Digital[1] co-executive editors Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher at the D: All Things Digital conference (D5) on May 31st, 2007. The interview session focused on how Microsoft and Apple came to be some of the most influential companies and most well-known corporate rivals in the world. The iconic photograph of Gates and Jobs laughing together was taken by Joi Ito[2] and uploaded via Flickr later that same day. However, the earliest known instance of a multi-pane comic based on Ito's photographs didn't emerge until it was highlighted on the Internet humor blog Sad and Useless[3] on May 16th, 2010.   On May 3rd, 2008, YouTuber Kajtokun uploaded a video entitled "Why the hell not??" to YouTube.[1] The video features two still images of three characters from the anime television series YuYu Hakusho, with the song "Let's Go Gekiganger 3" by Para Para Mecha MAX on the soundtrack. The still images are rotated, reflected and zoomed in and out in rhythm to the song and with a colorful background frantically flashing and changing hue to underscore the fast-paced intensity of the Para Para Mecha MAX song. The video (shown below) received more than 350,000 views in nine years. This song "Fever" has severa remixed/arranged version. But, the most popular tune in this fad is Super Smash Brothers Series version. On March 7th, 2010, a Youtube user called "Rubberfruit" released a Gmod video called "Francis's bike is not a horse" in which Francis rides a tricycle, with Carnival Game music from Dark Carnival playing, then Francis stops, and Ellis flies over a small building, flops in front of Francis, and claims that the Tricycle is a Horse. When Francis tells him otherwise, Ellis kicks him over a large building, where he explodes on impact, then Rochelle appears with a distorted face and moos like a cow, then the camera zooms to Ellis's face, which is also distorted. The very next day, "Heavys swan is not a horse" was uploaded by "Iwannapopy" which replaced Francis with a Heavy, the Tricycle with a swan boat, Rochelle with Nick, the Moo with a Meow and the camera zooms to Ellis's butt at the end instead of his face. In the day's that followed, even more responses appeared. (ordered by date uploaded) The music video was created by two animators at Slackcircus Studios[2], who were inspired by Eric Fensler's G.I. Joe PSA series, by pairing footage of the titular protagonist from the 1980s American cartoon series He-Man and the Masters of the Universe with American alternative rock band 4 Non Blondes' 1992 hit single "What's Up." On May 8th, 2005, the original copy of the video file was uploaded to the Something Awful forums[1] under the title "Fabulous Secret Powers" (shown below). The concept of improvising a public assembly was first denoted as a "smart mob" in author Howard Rheingold's book Smart Mobs: The Next Social Revolution published in 2002. The term "flash mob" was coined a year later on June 16th, 2003 by New York City-based experience designer Sean Savage[15] in a blog post[16] reporting on "inexplicable mobs" in New York City organized via email by Bill Wasik[17], who was a senior editor at Harper's Magazine at the time. The Keep Calm and Carry On poster was commissioned in 1939 by the temporary Ministry of Information in England[1], following the printing of two other inspirational posters stating "Freedom Is In Peril. Defend It With All Your Might" and "Your Courage, Your Cheerfulness, Your Resolution Will Bring Us Victory." It was intended to be used to strengthen morale in the event of a large-scale attack or occupation, which many considered inevitable at the time. Though more than million of these posters were originally commissioned[2], after the war ended they were kept in storage where most were destroyed. In 2000, Stuart Manley and his wife Mary found the poster folded at the bottom of a box of old books they purchased at an auction for their Alnwick, England bookshop, Barter Books.[3] Not knowing its origins, the couple had it framed and hung it in the shop, where they began selling prints of it the following year. According to Mary, they had sold over 40,000 copies by March 2009.[3] As of 2012, Barter is not the only place that houses original copies of the poster. The Imperial War Museum in England has approximately six and fifteen additional copies were found in February 2012, where they were appraised on the television show Antiques Roadshow.[15] The phrase "Dun Dun" exploded on 4chan's /b/ board in May 2010 following a moderator's decision to make the 4chan's post page display the following screen. On May 24th, 4chan users began ending all of their posts with "DUN DUN" as a reference to the sound effect. It first appeared on the polish chan, vichan.net, in the thread about Hołdys. Some anon found it to be exploitable and added the Holdys's glasses to some pictures. The people demanded a template and started making moar(Original thread in polish is in the gallery). Then it surfaced on 4chan's /b/ from the "Iz Dat Sum OC27" threads (parts I, II and III). The original picture was taken from the following photo of Zbigniew Hołdys(as you can see it in original thread on vichan). The name "Advice Animals" is taken from the Advice Dog image macro series that originated on September 7th, 2006. The image was first posted on the Mushroom Kingdom forums[1], and displayed a labrador puppy with the iconic color wheel background. The creator, Evan Herrington, said he was inspired by the "royal rainbow" from the Katamari Damacy video game series.  The concept of propaganda, which is broadly defined as any form of biased communication employed to influence public opinions through the power of persuasion, has been practiced for many centuries before the arrival of the modernity, most notably in times of religious and political reformations across Europe. However, the first large-scale and organized propaganda campaign was brought on by the outbreak of the Great War in 1914, during which both the British and German governments mass produced a series of posters, newsletters and even films to encourage voluntary recruitment of military forces and instill a strong sense of nationalism. Decades later, the use of propaganda grew and expanded drastically in the wake of the World War II, with the United States government leading the efforts by introducing nearly 200,000 different designs and messages for posters, radio broadcasts, films and newspapers, as well as other governments of both the Allies (United Kingdom, French Resistance, Soviet Russia) and the Axis (Nazi Germany, Italy and Japan). The earliest use of the concept appeared after the release of the chapter 354 of the manga series, "Heart", in which the Espada member Yammy reveals that he is the strongest member of the group after removing his number 10 and revealing that the chart goes from 0 to 9. On April 17th, 2009, a day after the chapter release, an anonymous user from 4chan's anime and manga board /a/ called Kubo "the troll of the year".[2] The popularization of this ass began with the YouTube poop video "GUTSMAN'S ASS" uploaded by Kajetokun on June 10th, 2007. The video has since gotten just under 900,000 views as of May, 2010. The video first shows a scene from the Animated series Mega Man Episode 2-25, "Bad Day at Peril Park" . In that episode, Mega Man's cyber-dog sidekick Rush tears off a part of a kangaroo disguise to reveal the posterior of Gutsman, a familiar nemesis of the show's main protagonist Mega Man. Pooper Kajetokun shows this scene, then goes on to show in other scenes from the Mega Man television series among others, a revelation that always ends with the buttocks of Gutsman to a dramatic chime(download soundbyte here) with an image of an angered Mega Man following. A memetic response was soon to follow. Gutsman's Ass on YTMND The meme's most basic form of practice…for five minutes:    On April 5th, 2010, the single topic blog Brosicingbros.com launched as a hub for all media related to the drinking game of the same name with the aforementioned rules. The game is supposedly the brainchild of a group of South Carolina college students to which the game started to spread statewide. All that is known about the founder is that he is a 22-year-old recent college grad who goes by "Joe". He does not respond to email communication. The site allowed users to submit pictures or videos of people getting iced of which the best content would be uploaded to the blog. As word spread about the game it would be reported on and publicized by publications such as the Huffington Post and Village Voice. Celebrities who have been iced include rapper Coolio, actor Dustin Diamond aka Screech, and astronaut Buzz Aldrin who rejected the ice. Diageo, the company that makes Smirnoff Ice, prior to the start of Bros Icing Bros was reporting sluggish sales of their malt beverage. Many stories on this topic accused Diageo of starting the blog as a viral marketing campaign. Diageo released an official statement on the matter: Icing is consumer-generated and some people think it is fun. We never want underage "icing" and we always want responsible drinking. The inherent dangers of icing are the same with any other binge consumption drinking game, but as part of the surprise aspect of the game icing in public venues is also a danger, and illegal in many parts of the world.    In March 29th 2007, a YouTube user named Kajetokun released a video named "ZETA PUUUUNCH", where characters' voices had been replaced with sounds of Captain Falcon from Super Smash Bros. Melee. As of January 8th 2014, the video has around 650,000 views. In spring of 2010, a new animated TV series called "Heroman"[1] premiered on April 1st. The plot was created by Stan Lee and the show was produced by the animation studio Bones for TV broadcast. In the first episode, we see the main character Joey Jones working at a café. Sitting at the counter is Stan Lee, who makes a cameo appearance[3] as a regular at the café. As Joey leaves the screen pans to Stan Lee as he asks “Hey Joey fill me up.” Stan Lee is also seen in the background of later episodes: On August 12, 2008, user BMATF submitted the following video using the character Cosmo from Sonic X and the sped-up version of the Super Mario World Ending theme as background music. Despite having less than 100,000 views, BMATF unintentionally caused other users to make similar, confusing videos and has become widespread enough that many YouTube users do not know its origin. Most of these videos have relatively low viewcounts (the highest ones being in the tens of thousands), but the amount of responses is impressive:    The original video was uploaded on youtube on October 22, 2008 [2]. It shows Bicha Muda in an interview with a certain Marleide Duarte. In the original video, a comment was posted with subtitles for the video: "i bung bung, Aaay bung, (click) nyy bung, i bung, nom nom nyybung, i﻿ bungbuh, i bung, nyuh bung, (click) nyuuhng, i geh gen i bung, myah(esta muy bonita, muy buen bestida…)i bung i bung, oyeh eh muh, i bung, I buh, (click) I bung, nya bung, UNG, I BUNG, (Girl talks once again) I BUNG!, I BUNGA!, (Girl again) I bung I bung, Nyy bung, Nyy bung, nthuyy??, aneeyng, I BUNGeh!!!, (Girl kiss) (FREE KISS) I bungeh, Ayeloo, (FREE KISS) I bung…   Prior to being uploaded to YouTube, asdf began as a webcomic series by TomSka. He initially posted the strips on Sheezyart[2] under the name “asdfman.”[3] Several of these strips went on to be featured on Tomska's own site, asdfland[4], following the movies’ rise to popularity on YouTube. Most of the clips used in the flash animations are taken from comic strips. Tom drew inspiration from The Lazer Collection other animated flash videos at the time, which he then decided to make his own animated series in a similar style. The first asdfmovie was uploaded to YouTube on August 10, 2008. As of October 2011, it has over 19 million views. The second video was uploaded on January 1st, 2010, and the third on December 30th, 2010. Each episode has been viewed over 18 million times. The fourth episode was uploaded on September 2nd, 2011, gaining over 7 million views within the first month of upload. The video was also highlighted as the Daily Feature on Newgrounds upon its release.[5] The fifth installment was released on May 11, 2012 and received over 1 million views in just over one day. Similarly, the sixth installment released on February 9th, 2012, received over 3 million views in just 3 days. It has been rumored[1] that the meme was inspired by the ending scene in the 1998 comedy-drama film Happiness, although the colloquial use of the phrase most likely predates the original release of the film. In the scene, an 11-year-old boy ejaculates for the first time and proclaims to a group of adults “I came.” A clip of the full scene can be found on YouTube.[2] On December 9th, 2006, the earliest known uses of the phrase on 4chan was posted in a "video game porn" thread in response to a photo of video game controllers posed to appear as if they were having sex.      The original post was made in mid-to-late 2007 on 4chan's /b/ board. The original post featured the copypasta along with an image of a young man holding a bottle of vodka with his arm around what appeared to be his girlfriend, as supported by the text (shown below). Magikarp was first introduced in the first generation of Pokemon games, Pokemon Red and Blue, which were released in 1996 in Japan and 1998 in the United States. In these games, the creature was described as "horribly weak." Since 1999, conversations about the pros and cons of training Magikarps have taken place on newsgroups including alt.games.nintendo.pokemon[2] and alt.games.pokemon[3] where several posters agreed the creature is only worth leveling up until 20 to get the powerful Gyarados, which could not be found in the wild in the original two games. The paparazzi photograph of sullen-looking Reeves eating a sandwich was taken sometime in May 2010 by the Splash News photographer Ron Asadorian[1]. The earliest known "Sad Keanu" photoshop thread can be found on 4chan-like archive called Green-ovale.net, from the /tv/ (television & films) board, dating May 23th 2010.[27] Another thread would pop-up on 4chan imageboard's /a/ (anime) board[28] dating back to June 1st, 2010: On June 3rd, 2010, Reddit user rockon4life posted an image with the phrase "I really enjoy acting…Because when I act, I'm no longer me" in a thread entitled "Keanu. More sadness in comments"[2]. The thread quickly made it to Reddit's front page, gathering over 281,000 page views.        On December 28th, 2008, New Jersey high school student Carlos Almonte attended a protest held outside of the Israeli embassy in New York against the bombing of the Gaza region. While protesting, he held up a picket sign that read "Death To All (Zionist) Juice." An image of Almonte holding the sign was first uploaded to the Webshots[1] members gallery on the day of the protest by the photographer, Pamela Hall. Little Green Footballs[2] blogged about the image the next day. The term vuvuzela[1] was first used in South Africa from the Zulu language or Nguni dialect meaning to make a vuvu sound (directly translated: vuvu-ing). It is also known as lepatata Mambu (its Tswana name), colloquially known in South Africa as "Moerstripper." As early as June 2009, a full year prior to the World Cup 2010, BBC published a story addressing the bad reputation of the Vuvuzela in an article entitled "In Defence of the Vuvuzela."[2] Excerpt:      The video itself is comprised of two main elements: the dancing chicken-eating man and the background audio. The dancing man came from a Kentucky Fried Chicken ad campaign which aired in 2009: The audio is a remix of the theme song from the late 1980's television show ALF by chiptune artist Zalza, also known as Alessandro Bulér from Sweden. He commented on the video on his Last.fm page. He had the following to say about the song: The original flash loop was posted to Pown.it on January 14th, 2010. It was created by a user named w33n. The loop became associated with 2204355 in March 2010 when the .swf file was uploaded to Imageshack. In July 2010, the imageshack uploader created a Facebook fan page to document their original upload.    The phrase was first uttered by the comedian Dave Chappelle playing as the character of Rick James, who shows complete disrespect to the party host Charlie Murphy by soiling their white leather couch with his boots. The original sketch aired February 11th, 2004 on Chappelle's Show.[1] The sketch, entitled "Rick James: Charlie Murphy's True Hollywood Stories," was co-written by Dave Chappelle and Charlie Murphy, who plays himself in the sketch.        On March 31, 2010, CardGamesFTW uploaded a video for April Fool's Day in which he claimed to be started a new Abridged series, which began with the infamous "Card Games on Motorcycle" segment and lead into a terribly done One Piece Abridged episode. In a case of extreme irony, the overuse of the phrase was meant to be a self-parody of LittleKuriboh's supposed overuse of catchphrases, but it has gone on to be one of the single most popular gags from the show. A similar occurence had happened previously when the character Joey attempted to make Brooklyn Rage his catchphrase. This is, however, not the first use of this phrase. On December 5, 2009, LittleKuriboh uploaded an overdubbed trailer for the 10th Anniversary Yu-gi-oh! movie to his other Youtube account, Ninjabridge . Roughly 55 seconds in, Jack Atlas yells the now infamous line.    In Age of Empires, the first installment in the strategy game series produced by Ensemble Studios and released in 1997 by Microsoft, the Priest is a civilian unit with special abilities to heal friendly units and convert enemy units. While casting the spell of "conversion," the Priest utters a distinct battle cry ("wololo"), which soon became associated with bad omen among the fans of the game. Upon completion, the color of the targeted unit's attire changes from red to blue (or blue to red). The first videos seemed to have surfaced around 2007 when YouTube user StSanders (real name – Santeri Ojala) from Finland used a few live performances from notable musical acts and after stripping the original audio from the footage, he re-dubbed the audio with his own instruments. Below is a clip from Jimmy Kimmel Live of Ojala creating one of these videos using a live video performance of Guns N Roses guitarist Slash in action (Slash happens to be there as a bonus): StSanders has since created a number of these videos, ranging from Yngwie Malmsteen and Slash to Carlos Santana and Angus Young. All of these different creations can be viewed on his new webpage at this link. Below is what is considered one of his best creations using the music video from Kiss's "I Was Made for Loving You." The video has received over a million hits since it's debut in 2008 and is still receiving positive acclaim:  In early July 2009, a forum user on the Chinese BBS community Baidu Tieba[1] posted a low-resolution webcam image of a man eating noodles with the accompanying text: "What [this] brother is eating aren't noodles, but loneliness!" (Chinese: 哥吃的不是面，是寂寞): Shortly after the original post, other users on the forum began repeating this sentence with slight variations, giving birth to the phrasal template "What X is Y'ing is not Z, It is Loneliness" (Chinese: XY的不是Z，是寂寞) and a series of parody images centered around the theme of sad bachelorhood and loneliness. According to numerous user accounts on Baidu Tieba, the expression was likely inspired by the narcissistic catchphrase "Don't obsess over me, I'm only a legend" that became popular earlier that year. On March 18th, 2008, DeviantART[4] user Kurobon uploaded a piece of art titled "LOL PENIS THE HEDGEHOG," parodying Sonic the Hedgehog fan art, with a caption that read "original character do not steal." As of March 2014, the art has over 300 views. In Season 2 Episode 23 of Spongebob Squarepants, originally aired on November 16th, 2000, the character Patrick mistakenly asserts "No, this is Patrick" when asked "Is this the Krusty Krab?" after being hired at the Krusty Krab restaurant (shown below) On November 4th, 2006, a thread was submitted to 4chan's /b/ (random) board asking "Is this /b/?" to which another user replied with a screen captured image of Patrick from the Spongebob Squarepants episodes saying "No, this is Patrick" (shown below).    On November 19th, 2009, Google's YouTube team announced[1] the release of a new automatic captioning feature for select videos, using the same voice recognition algorithm used to translate voicemails sent via Google Voice. Though the service was initially only available for a select few partner channels, the service had been launched for all YouTube users on March 4th, 2010.[4] The same day, several videos demonstrating the inaccuracy of automatic captions were uploaded to YouTube (shown below).      The image shown above can be found in a January 1st 1995 edition of Calvin and Hobbes[1]. Whilst the comic stated the plane was an F-14, a closer analysis suggests that the design was influenced by both F-14 Tomcat and F-15 Eagle model, marked by its flat-sided wings. Calvin and Hobbes is a daily comic strip syndicated from November 1985 to December 1995, written and illustrated by American cartoonist Bill Watterson. Even after the conclusion of daily comic strip in 1995, Calvin and Hobbes[2] remains in syndication around the world. Starting in 1997, a short video named "badday.mpg" began circulating online via email, which showed security footage of an angry office worker (played by Vinny Licciardi) who smashes his desktop computer in a fit of rage. The footage was staged and filmed by the Colorado-based technology company Loronix to promote their digital video surveillance systems and was initially distributed via CD-ROM.    The anime adaption for Durarara!! was produced by animation studio Brain's Base[1] and first aired in Japan on January 7th, 2010, where the series' first ending theme "Trust Me" was sung by Japanese Hip-Hop/R&B artist Yuta Matsushita[2] for episodes 1 through 12. The most notable characteristic of the ending sequences is the posing of the characters, which is drawn serially in one long still illustration.   The first chapter of of "Trapped in the Closet" was released on April 5th, 2005, which tells the story of the narrator Sylvester (played by Kelly) who awakes in a woman's bed after meeting her the previous night at a club. When he attempts to leave, her husband arrives and she urges him to hide in the closet. The videos for the first five chapters were released from May to June of 2005. The phrase originated in the satirical political action film Team America: World Police, written by South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, released on October 14th, 2004. The movie contained a song titled "America: Fuck Yeah!", with lyrics portraying a jingoistic-style of American patriotism. America, FUCK YEAH! Coming again, to save the mother fucking day yeah, America, FUCK YEAH! Freedom is the only way yeah, Terrorist your game is through cause now you have to answer too, America, FUCK YEAH! So lick my butt, and suck on my balls, America, FUCK YEAH! What you going to do when we come for you now, it's the dream that we all share; it's the hope for tomorrow The original "Don't obsess over me, I'm only a legend" thread was posted on March 25th, 2009, on the MOP forums. Referring to himself as "big brother"--a common label carrying the connotation of playful narcissism or self-conceit, the OP goes on a rant about how people shouldn't embrace his presence with open arms, as the big brother is a a legend to be admired and feared at the same time. The original post can be translated to: Confused by the ridiculous, "higher-than-thou" tone of his post, other forum users quickly reacted to the thread by mocking the OP with over 4900 tongue-in-cheek replies. The term "CAPTCHA"[1] was coined in 2000 by Carnegie Mellon University faculty members Luis von Ahn, Manuel Blum, Nicholas J. Hopper and John Langford. It is a contrived acronym based on the word "capture" and standing for "Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart." The practice of using CAPTCHA to create artworks dates back to 2009, when SomethingAwful user Bonk created a forum thread titled "What the hell is reCAPTCHA?"[2] on May 20th, 2009. Due to the thread's popularity, it was soon featured as SomethingAwful's official "Photoshop Phriday" threads[5][6].    Yu-Gi-Oh Trading Card Game is a Japanese collectible card game developed and published by Konami, based on the fictional game of Duel Monsters created by manga artist Kazuki Takahashi. The game was first launched in 1999 and distributed worldwide throughout the 2000s, mainly in Japan, North America, Europe and Australia. In July 2009, it was named the top selling trading card game in the world by Guinness World Records with over 22 billion cards sold worldwide.[1] In the game, Trap Cards[1] are a special type of playable card that can be used to inhibit your opponent and make the duel turn easier for you. These cards could also be "activated" during your opponent's turn.[13] The term "Murica" was used as early as September 1st, 2003 on the Democratic Underground[1] in a post asserting that "murica" would not hurt another country after after an earlier poster suggested[2] that the government was funding car bombs and building fires overseas.  The original performance took place on March 27th, 2010 at an apartment gallery event, FOREVER(21), in West Town, Chicago.[1] The event was organized by members of the Art Institute of Chicago's Multicultural Student Association.[2] Featuring works by several artists, the main fixture of the night was a performance by Natacha Stolz entitled "Interior Semiotics." A video of the performance was uploaded to YouTube on May 8th, 2010.  The man depicted in the image is Finnish resident KimmoKM, who discussed the origin of the meme in an IRC interview[1]: The meme started in a Finnish imageboard as "Ruma huora, en panisi" (ugly whore, I wouldn't fuck her) and then later I've occasionally seen it flying around 4chan and other sites There are now plenty of English variations that use the same smug approach, usually judging how sexually attractive he finds a member of the opposite sex.    Ghost Riding, or "Ghost-Riding The Whip" first became popular with E-40's 2005 hit "Tell Me When To Go"(shown below, right) , and Mistah FAB's "Ghost Ride It", released in 2008 (shown below, left). Ghost Riding may have first been inspired by the 1985 Michael J. Fox comedy Teen Wolf, in which a character does various tricks on top of a van with no driver.    The commercial originally aired sometime in mid to late 2009, during the Philippines campaign season. Manny Villar was a senator running for the presidency under the Nacionalista Party nomination. His commercial featured lower class Filipino children singing the song "Naging Mahirap", which had been written especially for the ad. The story begins with the narrator's discovery of a Pokémon named "Ghost" added to the usual line-up of Pokemon Red, which has the sprite of ghosts from the Lavender Town prior to obtaining the “sliph scope” item. The narrator goes on to reveal that the mysterious Ghost Pokémon had an unusual ability: It is also noted that if the player continued to use the “curse” ability, then the Pokémon trainer would disappear as well. The narrator describes the end of the game as being devoid of any other trainers or Pokémon and the story concludes with an unusual battle against a Ghost Pokémon who defeats the defenseless player by using the “curse” ability. It was also noted that if the player continued to use the "curse" ability, then the Pokémon trainer would disappear as well. The narrator describes the end of the game as being devoid of any other trainers or Pokémon and finishes with a battle with the Ghost Pokémon who kills you by using the "curse" ability. I’ve been able to find most of the ones that I’ve played online, but there’s one that I haven’t seen any mention of. I bought it at a flea market about five years ago. Here’s a picture of the cartridge, in case anyone recognizes it. Unfortunately, when I moved two years ago, I lost the game, so I can’t provide you with screencaps. Sorry. The game started with the familiar Nidorino and Gengar intro of Red and Blue version. However, the “press start” screen had been altered. Red was there, but the Pokémon did not cycle through. It also said “Black Version” under the Pokémon logo. Upon selecting “New Game”, the game started the Professor Oak speech, and it quickly became evident that the game was essentially Pokémon Red Version. After selecting your starter, if you looked at your Pokémon, you had in addition to Bulbasaur, Charmander, or Squirtle another Pokémon -- “GHOST”. The Pokémon was level 1. It had the sprite of the Ghosts that are encountered in Lavender Tower before obtaining the Sliph Scope. It had one attack -- “Curse”. I know that there is a real move named Curse, but the attack did not exist in Generation 1, so it appears it was hacked in. Defending Pokémon were unable to attack Ghost -- it would only say they were too scared to move. When the move “Curse” was used in battle, the screen would cut to black. The cry of the defending Pokémon would be heard, but it was distorted, played at a much lower pitch than normal. The battle screen would then reappear, and the defending Pokémon would be gone. If used in a battle against a trainer, when the Pokéballs representing their Pokemon would appear in the corner, they would have one fewer Pokéball. The implication was that the Pokémon died. What’s even stranger is that after defeating a trainer and seeing “Red received $200 for winning!”, the battle commands would appear again. If you selected “Run”, the battle would end as it normally does. You could also select Curse. If you did, upon returning to the overworld, the trainer’s sprite would be gone. After leaving and reentering the area, the spot [where] the trainer had been would be replaced with a tombstone like the ones at Lavender Tower. The move “Curse” was not usable in all instances. It would fail against Ghost Pokémon. It would also fail if it was used against trainers that you would have to face again, such as your Rival or Giovanni. It was usable in your final battle against them, however. I figured this was the gimmick of the game, allowing you to use the previously uncapturable Ghosts. And because Curse made the game so easy, I essentially used it throughout the whole adventure. The game changed quite a bit after defeating the Elite Four. After viewing the Hall of Fame, which consisted of Ghost and a couple of Pokemon I used for HM`s, the screen cut to black. A box appeared with the words “Many years later…” It then cut to Lavender Tower. An old man was standing, looking at tombstones. You then realized this man was your character. The man moved at only half of your normal walking speed. You no longer had any Pokémon with you, not even Ghost, who up to this point had been impossible to remove from your party through depositing in the PC. The overworld was entirely empty -- there were no people at all. There were still the tombstones of the trainers that you used Curse on, however. You could go pretty much anywhere in the overworld at this point, though your movement was limited by the fact that you had no Pokémon to use HMs. And regardless of where you went, the music of Lavender Town continued on an infinite loop. After wandering for a while, I found that if you go through Diglett’s Cave, one of the cuttable bushes that normally blocks the path on the other side is no longer there, allowing you to advance and return to Pallet Town. Upon entering your house and going to the exact tile where you start the game, the screen would cut to black. Then a sprite of a Caterpie appeared. It was the replaced by a Weedle, and then a Pidgey. I soon realized, as the Pokémon progressed from Rattata to Blastoise, that these were all of the Pokémon that I had used Curse on. After the end of my Rival’s team, a Youngster appeared, and then a Bug Catcher. These were the trainers I had Cursed. Throughout the sequence, the Lavender Town music was playing, but it was slowly decreasing in pitch. By the time your Rival appeared on screen, it was little more than a demonic rumble. Another cut to black. A few moments later, the battle screen suddenly appeared -- your trainer sprite was now that of an old man, the same one as the one who teaches you how to catch Pokémon in Viridian City. Ghost appeared on the other side, along with the words “GHOST wants to fight!”. You couldn’t use items, and you had no Pokémon. If you tried to run, you couldn’t escape. The only option was “FIGHT”. Using fight would immediately cause you to use Struggle, which didn’t affect Ghost but did chip off a bit of your own HP. When it was Ghost’s turn to attack, it would simply say “…” Eventually, when your HP reached a critical point, Ghost would finally use Curse. The screen cut to black a final time. Regardless of the buttons you pressed, you were permanently stuck in this black screen. At this point, the only thing you could do was turn the Game Boy off. When you played again, “NEW GAME” was the only option -- the game had erased the file. I played through this hacked game many, many times, and every time the game ended with this sequence. Several times I didn’t use Ghost at all, though he was impossible to remove from the party. In these cases, it did not show any Pokémon or trainers and simply cut to the climactic battle with Ghost. I’m not sure what the motives were behind the creator of this hack. It wasn’t widely distributed, so it was presumably not for monetary gain. It was very well done for a bootleg. It seems he was trying to convey a message; though it seems I am the sole receiver of this message. I’m not entirely sure what it was -- the inevitability of death? The pointlessness of it? Perhaps he was simply trying to morbidly inject death and darkness into a children’s game. Regardless, this children’s game has made me think, and it has made me cry.   "Rock My Emotions" was released under his alias Kitsune² for the album "Squaredance" on January 12th, 2009, under his defunct label VulpVibe Records (currently known as LapFox Trax).[1] The full song would then be uploaded to YouTube on June 11th, 2009.  This kind of photoshop technique began to be practiced in the threads in /morningcoffee/, a board for isolating fanatics of Japanese female idol collective Hello! Project,[2] in the Japanese textboard community 2channel around June of 2007. That board users had been making "10-yen Collages" (10円コラ), another series of photo collages making female idols look like naked by concealing their outfits by 10-yen coins, since the spring of 2004. This technique was one of the derivatives developed in a series for that thread.[3][4] In those days, this kind of photoshopped images was called in various names like "Marble Collage" (ビー玉コラ), "Worm-eaten Collage" (虫食いコラ) or "Perforated Collage" (穴あきコラ). However, these had never spread to the outside of the board. The Excalibur Face originates from the anime Soul Eater, in which Excalibur is concidered to be the most powerful weapon in the world. Technically anyone should be able to wield him, but unfortunately, people are unable to stand him for extended periods of time. He has an inflated ego, interrupts other speakers by calling them "fools", and goes on long, nonsensical rants. He also demands that his meister performs one thousand tasks, such as a daily five-hour reading of his own book, or celebrating his birthday on grand scale (which also happens to be a daily routine). Because of this, everyone who has had previous encounters with Excalibur, will express their intense dislike with an "Excalibur Face", every time he is brought up in a conversation.      The single topic tumblr site SocialNetworkingDolphin.com was created by James from Wales, UK on August 15th, 2010. The most notable image to be associated with the "I fucking love cocaine" caption shows a grizzly bear roaring while covered in snow, which first appeared on Memegenerator[1] (date unknown) as an iteration of the "More Bear" series. One of the earliest known postings of the original photograph of the bear was in a photodump post on the Russian copypast.ru[7] website on July 18th, 2009. This flash video is a derivative from Nijiura's photo collage fad of the crying and feared face of Renton Thurston, the protagonist boy Eureka Seven. It was taken from the last scene in the 19th episode "Acperience 2" aired on August 28th, 2005[2], where Holland Novak, one of the other main characters, is very upset at Renton and grabs him in his collar (shown below, left). This collaged photo fad featured Renton's very defiant duck face because Nijiura users liked to associate this scene with the crazy face expression of Doppio, the second persona of the villain in the 5th arc of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (shown below, right). By compiling those collage works along with the 2nd opening theme song for the anime "Shōnen Heart" by a Japanese hiphop trio Home Made Kazoku[3], this flash video titled "Mushoku Doutei Nijiura Seven" (Japanese: 無職童貞ニジウラセブン; lit. "Disemployed Cherry Boy Nijiura Seven") was created by an anonymous Nijiura user in September 2005. This flash video also features many other characters popular in Nijiura such as Godman, Uncle Atsushi, Spelunker, Shimonkin, 2k-tan from OS-tan, etc…   Within hours of announcement on September 1st, 2010, a twitter account called @itunes10icon was registered, vigorously defending itself from all the iTunes 10 haters via tweets.    No Fap September is an annual event that is rumored to have begun in the /b/ (random) board on 4chan in August of 2009, but an archived thread has yet to be found.     I Am Legend is a Will Smith film from 2007, based on the book of the same name. Before the film was released, it was previewed by test audiences, who disliked several scenes, including the climax, causing the film to be signifigantly altered before its release. The original ending contained Will Smith's Robert Neville under attack in his own house, where he performs experiments to find a cure for the virus that has vampirised the other humans. The alpha male vampire symbolises that he wants a woman Neville has been experimenting back, so when Neville gives her back, (not carrying the cure) the vampires leave Neville unharmed. After audiences disliked it, it was changed to have Robert hide Anna and Ethan (two other survivors) from the creatures, he charges at the vampires with a grenade and goes boom. After the general public heard about this alternate ending, many who didn't have it on the DVD searched it into the good ol' trusty, reliable Internet (namely YouTube). Some decided to create their own spoof versions of the ending, leading viewers to what they think is the official ending, then finding it's a spoof, basically, it's bait and switch. Participants lured in their victims using titles that included text like: "I Am Legend Alternate Ending (that we didn't put on the disc)" (see below for link to example). Eventually someone uploaded the proper version, spoiling the fun. :'( Original ending: (embedding disabled) Revised ending:  This line comes from a demo movie in the middle part of the video game. It's a quite serious monologue of Ryo Sakazaki riding on a motorbike (shown below, left). In the English version, this monologue is translated as "Fighting a guy with a weapon. I must use "Haow-Ken"" (shown below, right).   On September 1st, 2010, kansascity.com[1] reported on an early-morning robbery at the local Shell Food Mart. On the same day, news station KMBC posted a video to YouTube[2] interviewing Diana Radcliff, a victim of the robbery, outside of the store in which she gives an eccentric retelling of the story, acting out various parts, including an infamous section where she describes how she had to "back it up" to distance herself from the robbers (shown below). The video went viral as viewers began to share it on social media with the original upload garnering over 812,000 views in 11 years. On September 3rd, YouTuber[3] loraaah reuploaded the video under the title, "Best Witness Statement Ever – Eccentric Lady," garnering over 1 million views in a comparable span of time.  The original video in this series titled "Spitting while Kissing" was posted to NND on November 12th, 2008[2] by user cdm who had also triggered a similar hand-drawn animation meme Panchira Series in the summer of that year. This hand-drawn animated video comically reproduces lyrics of the song by Nozomi Kasuga and Taira no Tomomori from 2004 Japanese Otome game[3] Harukanaru Toki no Naka de 3.[4] In addition, it has a parody of Nice Boat. in the end of footage. That is a metaphor means forthcoming scenes is censored because it has mature contents inappropriate for broadcasting. That is a metaphor meaning the forthcoming scene has been censored because it has mature contents which are inappropriate for broadcasting. Not much is known about the origin, except that it had to originated before 2005. It is assumed that the meme has been passed from its origin from user to user overtime. It would have likely started up on a early site that hosted .swf files such as 4chan. The clip is from GI Joe season 1, episode 20 :Cobra’s Candidate.  The earliest uploaded instance comes from a Russian Youtube video (no audio) from September 1st, 2010: Entitled ПИЗДЕЦ МНЕ!, meaning "I'm fucked!", renamed in ПИЗДЕЦ МНЕ! Inception Cat further on, following the Inception Cat phenomenon, that video has gathered more than 2,200,000 views as well and, similar to the other video, it's the only one video uploaded by user THTTB on its Youtube account. A peek at the video graph shows that it has had a parallel fame as its modified version, starting around September the 2nd : The Youtube clip was originally submitted by user spederson7 on September the 2nd 2010. It's the only video that can be found on the user's channel, who subscribed to Youtube on July 2006. It features a camera shot at ground level of the bottom frame of what looks like a glass door between two rooms. Because of what little can be seen from both rooms, it is assumed that the room the camera is in is a shower room and the room the camera is filming can be a loggia/mezzanine. Aside from the Inception soundtrack, the video description simply states Inception Cat will haunt your dreams. In the first month of its upload, the video received over 2,300,000 views. In 2006, Japanese toy company Kaiyodo[1] released their Revoltech line of collector-oriented toys that consisted mainly of Anime figures. In 2010, Kaiyodo broadened their variety of toys with a new subline called the Sci-Fi (Tokusatsu) Revoltech series. This line focused on iconic characters from Japanese and American film and television series like Mothra, Gamera, the Alien, Jack Skellington, and Batman. In March of 2010, Kaiyodo unveiled prototypes of Buzz Lightyear and Sheriff Woody from the Toy Story movies.[2] Like most Revoltech toys, the Woody figures had an alternate faceplate to choose from. The grinning expression has been compared to a trollface or rape face on 4chan's /toy/ board, where it was used as a reaction image prior to the toy's release. It is believed to have been inspired by a scene from Toy Story where Woody fools Buzz into thinking something is behind him (:55 seconds in):  The face comes from the DC Comics animated film Superman/Batman: Apocalypse[1] that was released in 2010. It can be seen in the following clip where Superman introduces his cousin to Batman:   The original song, titled "There Right There", originates from the 2007 Broadway musical adaptation of the 2001 comedy movie Legally Blonde[1]. Within the song, a group of lawyers are seen discussing the whether or not the witness is indeed gay, or just European. The original audio of the musical number was first uploaded to YouTube on November 25, 2007, and has since gained over 600,000 views as of May 2016.  It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia creator Rob McElhenney came up with the idea of the Green Man at the Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia after a football game between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Dallas Cowboys. In the parking lot after the game, one of McElhenney’s friends stripped off his clothes to reveal a full-body green lycra suit, which prompted those around him to begin chanting “Green Man! Green Man!” The Green Man suit was first featured in Season 3, Episode 3 "The Gang Gets Invincible", which first aired on September 13th, 2007. In the episode, the character Charlie Kelly dances in the suit while under the influence of the psychedelic drug Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD) (shown below). The Green Man was later featured in the It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia episode titled “America’s Next Top Paddy’s Billboard Model Contest” on September 25th, 2008 and “The World Series Defense” on October 22nd, 2009. The use of hashtags began on IRC networks, whose chat rooms all begin with a hash symbol followed by the topic name. However, in this situation, the chat is limited to participants who appear in the room and can expand upon different topics as the conversation flows. Using a hashtag to collect posts across an entire social network was first suggested for use on Twitter by Google user experience designer Chris Messina[2] on August 23rd, 2007.[3] how do you feel about using # (pound) for groups. As in #barcamp [msg]? Messina followed up this tweet with a blog post[4], fleshing out an idea for Twitter Tag Channels, building ways for people to have a discussion without the need for @ replies. He used March 2007's South by Southwest Interactive as an example, noting that if hashtags had been implemented, people who were not necessarily following each other could follow tweets containing information and experiences of South by Southwest with the hashtag #sxsw. A proposal page linking to other blog posts advocating for the use of Tag Channels was also established on Twitter Fan Wiki.[5] Five days later, on August 28th, 2007, web anthropologist Stowe Boyd coined the term "hash tag" in a blog post[9] arguing for tag support. Bill Nye the Science Guy began airing on PBS Kids on September 10th, 1993, hosted by American educator Bill Nye.[3] and was designed to teach science to children in an entertaining manner. The original theme was written by composer Mike Green[2], who used a hip hop beat with a sampled vocal track repeatedly shouting "Bill" throughout the song. Though clips from the song were used in YTMND sites as early as May 2004[5], the first full-length remix of the song didn't emerge until on January 7th, 2006[4], which infused hardcore techno beats into the theme. The song was later reuploaded to YouTube by several different users.   Noroi no Yakata Daiichiwa was originally released on the Japanese file-sharing website Vector on July 21st, 1996.[2] However, its strangeness and greatness caught nearly no attention till a gameplay video of it was uploaded on Nico Nico Douga (NND) and on YouTube both on January 2nd, 2008.[3] And to make matters worse, the original game itself was put offline from the public several years before. Many watchers were knocked out by its strangeness and greatness. According to an article about this video in Nico Nico Pedia, an internet encyclopedia for NND,[4] it scored 1 million views on NND on May 11th, 2008. Currently, it has over 1.8 million views. On YouTube however, it only has over 200,000 views. An article for this game in Nico Nico Pedia tells the reasons why this game is loved by many NND users.[5] These are its extreme difficulty, as well as the strange jumping, crouching pose, and epic death cry, "IeAAAA!" (“イ゛ェアアアア！”), all three performed by the game's protagonist. Soon after the gameplay video became popular, the protagonist was often called by viewers as "IeA" (because of his death cry) and especially "Hiroshi" (because of his look resembling Hiroshi Nohara (野原 ひろし) from Crayon Shin-chan[6]) in their opinions.   The nickname "Baghdad Bob" was bestowed upon al-Sahhaf as early as April 2003, after foreign news media stationed in Iraq began watching his exaggerated but enthusiastic news briefs.[19] The nickname was a nod to two others given to similar propagandists in other wars: Hanoi Hannah[20], given to radio personality Trịnh Thị Ngọ during the Vietnam War, and Seoul City Sue[21], given to Methodist missional Anna Wallis Suh during the Korean War. While "Baghdad Bob" was used mostly by American news media, al-Sahhaf was given the nickname "Comical Ali" in the UK as a play on the nickname of Ali Hassan al-Majid, Iraq's Interior Minister during the Persian Gulf War, "Chemical Ali." The earliest known image compilation of hand-drawn icons can be found in a 4chan /b/ (random) thread[1] dating back to November 30th, 2007. The OP began the thread with a rather poorly drawn Google site logo and the misspelled caption "Gouleg." The original thread was met by positive response on /b/ and went on to inspire over 200 reply posts showcasing various sketches of well-known desktop icons. The exact origin of the term is unclear. On November 7th, 2002, Urban Dictionary[1] user D'emon submitted an entry for "shit storm," describing it as an unpleasant consequence of failure. On September 27th, 2005, the Family Guy direct-to-DVD film Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story It features Al Harrington (voiced by Danny Smith), the President and CEO of Al Harrington’s Wacky Waving Inflatable Arm Flailing Tube Man emporium and warehouse, located on Route 2 in Weekapaug, Rhode Island, telling television viewers that because of a shipping error, he was overstocked with Wacky Waving Inflatable Arm Flailing Tube Men, and was passing the savings onto potential customers.  While the source of the image has not been found, it is rumored to have come from an interview with Cornette held sometime in 2000.[2] According to a thread on GameFAQs (as archived on LurkerFAQs)[2] the reaction image from the interview was originally popularized on the drug enthusiast image board 420 chan (shown below). It appeared in an image round-up post on The Chive on December 9th, 2009. It did not receive the name "Horsegirl of the Apocalypse" until being tweeted on April 26th, 2010 by Dino Ignacio, and was immediately posted on BuzzFeed by Veronica Belmont. Michael Jackson's Moonwalker refers to a Sega Genesis console game, arcade game and PC game with the same storyline but different methods of gameplay. Each game reflects the overarching themes found in the movie Moonwalker and features Jackson as the main protagonist who attempts to use music and dance moves to rescue kidnapped children from the evil “Mr. Big.”   Though their exact origin is unknown, the practice of making fake reviews is often employed by spammers on many websites who are trying to sell exotic products. The practice has also been used by the trolling communities and is often an element in comedy sketches that parody advertisements (see Kitchen Gun and Infomercial Fails).     The photo spread titled "White Hot" was published in the May 2010 issue of the L.A. Times Magazine. Styled by James Valerie, the white clothing in the spread was supposedly meant to represent his unbelievable and unimaginable good fortune throughout his life. Bryant himself commented on the clothing during a pre-photo shoot interview with LA Times writer Tom Murray: Tom Murray: I have to ask, when you’re in that chopper, do you ever look down on the city, pinch yourself and say-- Kobe Bryant: How the hell did this happen? Absolutely--every time. Like I’m sitting here right now. [Nods toward the two ladies primping him.] You know what I mean? This is dream s--t. Wardrobe that’s all white? This just doesn’t happen. Not for me. This is crazy.     Felipe Avello is a standup comedian in Chile who recruited a little person to act as Hillary Clinton for a video series in 2008. The first video, shown below in a mirrored re-upload, had the unknown person dressed in a conservative power suit and other costumes, and proclaiming himself to be "The little Hillary Clinton." In some of their videos, a mysterious character in bondage called "Machine" (a reference to the 1999 film 8 MM, and played by Avello himself) not only dances but also rubs all over her.       The figurines of Sasuke and Naruto were first released sometime in July 2010 as McDonald's Happy Meal toys in Japan and Taiwan. Even though issued as a simple bend-and-flip toy, Balancing Sasuke has gained its recognition not because of its ability to perform flips, but because of its amazing ability to successfully balance numerous large and heavy objects upon his head (and vise versa). For the notorious quality of its appearance, Sasuke toy soon gained the nickname "邪神佐助" (literally translated as "Evil God Sasuke") in Taiwan. On July 21, 2010, Jorsindo forum user, tarly110 posted a thread about his Happy Meal toy review. Despite the poor quality of the figure, Sasuke's balancing act never ceases to amaze. tarly110 provided images of Sasuke balancing objects from house hold appliances to motorcycles. Possibilities seemed endless.      On July 23rd, 1996, the founder of the web hosting company Soylent Communications, Thomas E. Dell, registered the domain Rotten.com, after writing a program that scraped and listed domain names available for purchase on the Internet. The site featured numerous videos and images of deceased people and murder. According to the Rotten.com FAQ[6], Dell launched the site initially as a "'what should I do with this domain now that I blew a hundred bucks on it' excuse." The website's design has remained largely unchanged over the years, with the 1997 layout (shown below, left) nearly matching the 2015 layout (shown below, right). The site considered one of the earliest Shock Sites online. The template "Bitches Love X" is derived from a quote in the episode "Let's Nab Oprah" in the first season of the animated TV series The Boondocks.[1] The episode originally aired on February 12th, 2006, as part of Cartoon Network's Adult Swim programming block. In the episode, the character Ed Wuncler III[19] (voiced by comedian Charlie Murphy) comments on texting a woman with the line “I sent that bitch a smiley face, bitches love smiley faces.”  On October 23rd, 2010, a video was uploaded to YouTube showing footage from a Q&A session from that week's BlizzCon. During the session a red-shirted teenage boy managed to stump Blizzard designer Alex Afrasiabi and loremaster Chris Metzen with a rather obscure question concerning a seemingly minor character in the WoW universe. Red Shirt Guy: Hello. I have… I just finished reading The Shattering yesterday and I noticed something. It said that Falstad Wildhammer was going to be on the Council of Three Hammers but in the beta it's Kurdran Wildhammer and Falstad is not in the game at all. What happened to him? Chris Metzen: Isn't Falstad dead? From Day of the Dragon? No? Red Shirt Guy: No, he survived and in fact he was the leader of Aerie Peak in vanilla WoW through Wrath of the Lich King. Chris Metzen: Of course… Yeah, Alex what's up with that? Alex Afrasiabi: Thanks, Thanks for pointing that out. We're going to get that fixed. Red Shirt Guy: Thank you.            René La Taupe (Rene the mole) s a virtual singing character created in 2009 by Fox Mobile Group studios.[1] The character, which is in fact a groundhog, was made famous through a music for mobile phone and a music video available on the Internet. The character was created to mediate ringtones on behalf of Jamster, a distributor of content for mobile phones that had already produced Crazy Frog. (Source : Wikipedia) René la Taupe started by the ringtone "Merde" (Shit). The single reached number 30 in Germany and remained nine weeks on the charts (it was) the most downloaded song of 2009 on the German version ). The meme really started in France, where the Single "Mignon, Mignon" had a huge success . The song was about an animal who have a chubby look which make it adorable. Its success of the single generated an increase of the ringtone sales, becoming one of the most downloaded of the middle of 2010. The video on youtube was viewed more than 5 million times in two months. A special version, called "Mauvais, Mauvais" (Bad Bad) was released. It was about the France Team Failure at the Soccer World Cup. René la Taupe made some others songs which didn't topped the impact of "Mignon Mignon" Original video of "Mignon Mignon" Original video of "Scheiße, ich liebe dich" (Cannot embed it)              The earliest found example comes from 3 Aug 2006, Uploaded to Google videos by Arul Mathur, simply titled "Car seat dance" and stating "Arul cannot resist dancing even when bound by car seat belts".

"The internet is leaking, I think. And it’s changing what people see as funny, one broadband connection at a time." The Miami New Time Blog posted an article on 11/19/10 titled "Mugshots Friday: Dented Heads, Bandanna Tattoos and Weird Beards" that included a mugshot of Carlos Rodriguez, a man who had been arrested for attempting to solicit a prostitute. The profile shot showed the man's striking cranial cavity, and was posted to Reddit the same day. The picture has been claimed to be authentic by the Miami New Times Blog, and they posted a follow up article containing a previous mugshot of the same man – Yes, That Flattened Head Mugshot is Real The phrase was popularized by the cast member Ronnie from Season 1, Episode 6 of the MTV reality series Jersey Shore, originally aired on January 7th, 2010, in which he engages in a physical scuffle with a person on the boardwalk at Seaside Heights, NJ:[7]      During the winter of 2010, webcomic creator Nick Franco,[1] known as "Nuzlocke," created and posted the first of a comic series titled "Pokémon: Hard-Mode" to 4chan's /v/ board, in which he illustrates his current game of Pokémon: Ruby while following the rules of the "Nuzlocke Challenge," a method of playing Pokémon games that Nuzlocke invented himself that makes them more difficult (shown below).[2] To follow the challenge, players must set their Pokémon free if they die, encouraging the player to level their Pokémon up and play more strategically, and gain a greater appreciation for each Pokémon. They must also catch the first Pokémon they encounter in every area and nothing else. When he posted the comics on the /v/ board, it quickly became popular, mostly due to a drawing of "Nuzlocke," a Nuzleaf which was drawn with the likeness of John Locke from "LOST" (shown below).[3] The comic's original thread inspired others to take the Nuzlocke Challenge, changing the rules at times to suit their tastes. It wasn't long before people also started chronicling their own run-throughs of the challenge and sharing them online. The phrase originated sometime before 2003, with the earliest found mention of it as an Urban Dictionary definition on February 21, 2003. The exact origin is currently unknown. The mugshot format, which typically consists of a full face portrait and a side profile shot, was invented by French policeman Alphonse Bertillon (shown below) who introduced the practice to law enforcement in 1888. Although police photographs have long been accessible to the public, celebrity mugshots weren't quite established as a staple subgenre of viral media until the early to mid-2000s, when they became more readily available online through the websites of law enforcement agencies. Beginning in the late 2000s, several dozens of mugshot publishing websites were launched, as well as a number of online mugshot removal services that assist in getting rid of booking photographs from the Internet for a fee.     In the TV station, ABS-CBN's Pilipinas, Game KNB? was started to used from Urszula Dudziak's song "Papaya" Then, it was appeared on ABC's Good Morning America Reuters and MSNBC  On April 25th, 1995, the film Toy Story premiered in the United States.[1] In the film, the character Woody tricks Buzz into thinking that there was an alien behind his back by yelling, "Buzz, look an alien!" On May 31st, 2009, YouTuber posted a variation of the scene, remixing the Toy Story footage with footage from the film Alien. The post received more than 48,000 views in a little over 10 years (shown below).      Leave X to me originated when someone posted an image of Russian president Vladimir Putin with an eyepatch on the 27th of December, accompanied with the phrase "Leave Bond to me". There after those on /b/ and other boards of 4chan began using this and expanding upon it. It is used still throughout 4chan but usually gets the most use on the board of /sp/ where the sporting world provides plenty of excuses, opportunities to make new macros.  he eleventh film adaptation of the Star Trek franchise was directed by JJ Abrams and premiered on May 8th, 2009. Shortly before its theatrical release, Abrams acknowledged the lens flares in an interview published by the science fiction blog io9 on April 27th, 2009.[2] Following the premiere in May, Star Trek fans and bloggers began commenting on the overwhelming presence of lens flares throughout the movie. Many image macros taking aim at the director’s obsession with the special effect were posted in a thread on the ontd_startrek Livejournal[3] page on June 10th, 2009.    Despite the poor grammar commonly associated with LOLcat phenomenon, the catchphrase "I made you a cookie but I eated it" originates from a 2005 comic strip from the Pon and Zi web comic by artist Azuzephre (a.k.a Jeff Thomas). It was first submitted on his Deviant Art account on January 29th, 2005. According to the artist's description: According to an article in the gaming blog Gamasutra[11], Bennett Foddy began learning how to create video games while procrastinating from completing his dissertation in philoshophy. On November 10th, 2008, while working as part of the faculty at the University of Oxford, Foddy released the game QWOP on his website Foddy.net.[1] The game featured a player-controlled runner named "Qwop", who is competing in a 100-meter sprint. The players legs could be controlled by pressing the keys 'Q', 'W', 'O' and 'P', with each key manipulating either a calf or upper leg. To complete the game, the player had to jump over a hurdle at 50 meters before crossing the 100 meter mark on the track.     The Trollface was originally drawn by Carlos Ramirez, an Oakland-based artist known by his DeviantART[1] handle Whynne, as part of a MS Paint webcomic about the pointless nature of trolling on 4chan's /v/ (video games) board. The comic was uploaded to deviantART on September 19th, 2008. In the deviantART post, Ramirez added a note revealing that he was attempting to draw a comic character known as the "Rape Rodent."    On December 11th, 2010, Redditor moifaux added a thread titled "How to drive Harry Potter, Star Wars and LOTR fans insane with just one pic."[3] The photo the thread linked to featured a picture of Gandalf, a character in Lord of the Rings and featured a quote from Star Wars attributed to Dumbledore, a character in Harry Potter. As of August 2014, the photo has gained over 2,000 points. The fruitless nature of online arguments has been mocked since as early as March 2005, when Rich "Lowtax" Kyanka posted a guide to winning an internet argument on SomethingAwful.[6] By September 2006, the phrase "internet argument" was defined on Urban Dictionary[7] as "something that idiots do online." The phrase evolved into an image macro caption by 2007[9], paired with a photo later known as "Girl Yelling at Yak." One of the earliest archived uses of the image was posted to 4chan's /b/ (random) board on May 21st, 2007. However, since the entire thread was not archived, the context of the post is unknown. The satirical website was created on February 22nd, 2002 by an unknown twenty-something author based in Michigan under the pseudonym Robert Hamburger, mimicking the compositional skills of a teenage boy with an unfathomable obsession for ninjas. Inundated with hyperbolic language praising the masculine prowess of the Japanese warriors, the website gained a lot of attention after rumors began circulating that a fictitious civil lawsuit had been filed against the author by a mother who became concerned that it corrupted her child.      The face came from a comical chart named "What you wrote… What you meant… What you actually did…" The earliest found date for when the comic was published is April 8, 2009 when user paperwasp uploaded it to Reddit. The comic has been spread to other well known websites, like Digg and Tumblr.    The face first appeared in a rage comic submited on the Spanish-language humor site Cuanto Cabrón on December, 2010 by user "jorjo".[1] In the comic, a man is shown saying to a woman "Look to that thing", followed by a panel where the woman turns her head while saying "What thing?", as the man stares at her breasts. On the third pannel, the woman turns her head back as the man looks back at her face while saying "Nothing…". On the final panel shows the rage face, as the man feels like a ninja for having fast reflexes. The original comic has been removed from the page, as the user. This meme originated from a skit in asdfmovie2. The video was created by Tom "Ska" Ridgewell (TomSka), and uploaded to YouTube on January 1st, 2010. TomSka included I Like Trains in his next iteration, asdfmovie3, which was uploaded on December 30st, 2010, almost exactly a year later. Though absent from asdfmovie4, TomSka would later create an "I Like Trains" music video. In 2004, Jay-Z released "The Black Album" which featured the song "99 Problems", taking the title and chorus from Ice-T's song "99 Problems" released in his 1993 album Home Invasion: It is also interesting to note that the chorus lyrics in Jay-Z's "99 Problems" differs slightly from Ice-T's version: - Ice-T, "99 Problems" (1993)   According to an article in The Star,[5] LOLcats originated on the imageboard 4chan sometime in 2005, when an anonymous user submitted a picture of a relaxed cat waiting for "Caturday." In a blog post on Time Magazine's TechLand,[7] writer Lev Grossman published an email claiming that Caturday was created in 2005 as a protest to "Furry Friday" threads. "There is more than enough EXIF data scattered around the internet to prove that cat macros are ancient, by internet standards. Caturday, for example, was a meme on a 4chan.org imageboard which originated around the beginning of 2005 as a protest against \”Furry Friday\” threads (In which basement-dwelling creeps would post anthropomorphic disney characters giving [sorry, gotta go family values at this point." This teasing culture was started in Taiwan and spread to Hong Kong. Other information about the origin (including that of Asian and Western society) is unknown by the current editors of this entry. If you have more information about the origin, feel free to suggest changes.    The man shown in the original photograph is a Japanese comedian named Ayumu Kato, who became one of many celebrity victims in the popular hidden-camera prank show Panic Face King. In the episode, Kato is introduced to a group of businessmen (played by hired actors) under the premise of a business meeting. But as they begin their conversation, the three businessmen suddenly get shot down in front of him and a man wearing body armor enters the room to fire at the "snipers" outside. Kato falls to the floor in panic and moments later, another man enters the room with a gun, puts it to his head and informs him that he'd been punked by the TV show. The clip was uploaded by YouTuber clicktoriscom on January 29th, 2010. The original image comes from the 1989 Disney animated film The Little Mermaid[10], which was based on the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale of the same name. Blogger Braden Graeber[1] is credited as the creator of Hipster Mermaid on the F Yeah Hipster Ariel Tumblr[2], where the earliest known instance was posted on February 2nd, 2011. Hi, my name's Braden. A little over a week ago. I photoshopped raybans on ariel and posted it as my facebook profile picture (I have red hair and wear raybans) and onto my tumblr. I posted a few more versions with all-caps Helvetica captions. The rest is meme history… Graeber also operates related social media accounts like Twitter[3] and Facebook[4] pages for "Hipster Mermaid" macros.   The earliest captioned images were made by American photographer Harry Whitter Frees[1] in 1905. The picture consisted of a photograph of a cat dressed in a robe sitting on a chair and a caption that says: "What's Delaying My Dinner?" It is also considered the prototype of LOLcats that became immensely popular a century later. The term "image macro" was first coined in Something Awful[2] in 2004. In the forums, users could summon a number of default image macros using simple commands like [img – macro], for example, timelines, "Aces!" and "Captain Obvious to the Rescue!" images. The name is derived from the computer scientific definition of a macro: a rule or pattern that specifies how a certain input sequence should be mapped to an output sequence according to a defined procedure. The earliest definition of an image macro was submitted by SomethingAwful forum user Eclipse[3] on February 12th, 2004.    On February 15th, Welsh actor Anthony Hopkins appeared on Televisa's popular news program El Noticiero con Joaquín López-Dóriga to answer some questions about his upcoming supernatural thriller film The Rite. In the interview, the anchor began asking questions in his native Spanish, hoping for the real-time English translation to kick in, but ended up experiencing audio technical difficulties. Originally intended to mean "Why The Rite?" as to ask what motivated Hopkins to join the cast, Dóriga's heavy accent resulted in the highly exploitable, hard-to-decipher phrase "Juay De Rito?" Reaction images have their roots in the pictorial representation of facial expressions known as "emoticons", with the first recorded instance produced by Scott Fahlman on September 19th, 1982. The exact origin of reaction images is difficult to trace, but it early examples have appeared on Futaba Channel (2chan) and 4chan. One of the earliest known reaction faces is the facepalm, which was first recorded on Urban Dictionary[10] on February 10th, 2004. Although it's hard to put an exact date on when satirical posters such as these began appearing in real life, one of the first of such posters to gain an online notoriety was "Look At This Dog" posted to Flickr by Sugar Freak on October 23rd, 2007. This was soon followed three days later by "Cat Found!!!", which was posted to flick by bezitted (account since deleted) on October 26th 2007. Although it is hard to say if "Look At This Dog" and "Cat Found" are directly related, it is probably no coincidence they appeared online within such quick succession. "Cat Found" has since gone on to spawn multiple imitators (even popping up on The Best Of Craigslist in November 2008), and has set the tone for many more IRL Troll Posters, all of which follow one of several themes: The earliest known mention of the phrase "didn't read, LOL" can be found in a ColoradoFans forum thread posted on September 14th, 2006.[1] In the thread, the original poster (OP) shared photographs of his 2006 Silverado pickup truck with a verbose description of upgraded features, to which forum user Dillusion replied: I didn't read lol. I just looked at the pictures. The first known GIF instance featuring the phrase surfaced some years later in July 2008, when IGN forum member[2][3] Jaslar_Tha_Kidd_2 posted an animated GIF of dancing Sam Norman from the 2007 viral music video What What in response to the original poster's lengthy post about his relationship issue. The concept of creating a hybrid character has been illustrated through Pokemon fan art since as early as November 2008 with a contest hosted by the Kongregate[3] message board to see who could create the best fused sprite out of Pokemon creatures in canon. The winning submission (shown below) incorporated various features from Infernape, Giratina, Metang, Articuno and Alakazam. According to Google cache results, a page for "Grumpy Grandpa" was created on the image macro site Meme Generator[1] in October of 2010, which featured a photograph of an enraged old man. Two of the earliest submitted examples featured captions with racist and xenophobic statements (shown below). The OVA series were made by Natural High studios and directed by Katsuyoshi Yatabe[2] and were released on DVD by the group of adult movies companies Soft on Demand. There's a total of 3 episodes, one edited version from the first episode, a manga, a PC game and a compilation of songs.[3] He started appearing in Steve's threads in 4chan in m February 2011, but his origins are probably in reddit. While many believe the quote originated from the video game Duke Nukem 3D, it actually comes from the 1988 movie They Live. In the movie, a man named Nada, played by Roddy Piper, finds a pair of sunglasses which lets him see that aliens are disguised as humans, and discovers hidden subliminal messages everywhere. Nada then steals a police shotgun and whist evading the police stumbles into a bank proclaiming "I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass…and I'm all out of bubblegum."    The origin of the Wow! It's F*cking Nothing! macros is current unknown. Several instances of the macro appear to be drawn in MS Paint or a similar program, and more sophisticated edits to these occur later, so it is possible that these are the earliest pictures. The earliest image yet found originated on 4chan and was posted in 2009 [1], but as it appears to contain more sophisticated editing then other images it is unlikely that it is the true original marcro.    The music comes from the recent video game called Marvel vs. Capcom 3. Before the game was released, the playable characters were revealed on a regular basis, with a trailer showing each of them. M.O.D.O.K. was releaved in October 2010. A few weeks later, YouTube user Pikawil64 used this music with the video series Never Say No To Panda. The music starts at the moment the panda appears, during its trolling. This video has been viewed more than 60,000 times since its appearance. More than 40 videos of this kind appeared after this one, with hundreds, even thousands of views for each of them. Here are some examples.     The trope of cheesy pick up line cliches has been previously documented and explored through various internet humor sites[1] and the mainstream media prior to the rise of user-generated content on the web. The original advice animal instance was first posted via Reddit by user SotorDamotor on February 14th, 2011 in a thread titled "Introducing Pickup Line Panda [crosspost]."[2]    Preconceptions about White people's poor sense of rhythm or dancing skills have been explored by Black stand-up comedians as early as since the 1980s with Eddie Murphy's 1987 standup show "Eddie Murphy's Raw." In the skit, Murphy declares it as a simple fact that "white people can't dance well": The comedy trope continued in the mainstream media throughout the 2000s, such as The Dave Chappell Show which frequently made light of the racial stereotype through skits. The most notable skit guest starring singer-songwriter John Mayer aired on February 4th, 2004: In the world of stand-up comedy, the theme has been also referred to as the "White Dude, Black Dude"[2] trope. While the original video was uploaded on October 25th, it wasn't until March 21st, 2011 that it appeared on Gawker. The victim was quoted saying that the fight started when he entered the train: "I got on the subway and accidentally bumped his leg and it started. He called me a p*ssy and I told him 'I am what I eat.' When a girl laughed he went ballistic."    The image of the "yiayia" was cropped from the advertisements of the Athenos branded greek yoghurt and hummus. The cropped image was retrieved from this ad: The grandma shows her disapproval from the man in the ad not having a job (Y U NO have job?)    The screenshot images come from the lecture hall scene in the film, wherein Mark Zuckerberg and another student exchange a note during class. In the scene, a girl passes a note to Zuckerberg sitting in the back of lecture hall. The image was first found in a canv.as thread, featuring 3-pane verticals in similar vein to the Machine Code meme. On March 31, 2011, "Make a Gorilla Face" instance was posted via Reddit thread, which quickly spread through popular blogs, forums and social bookmarking services. The Japanese light novel series Oreimo[1] was written by Tsukasa Fushimi and its first volume was released in Japan under the publisher ASCII Media Works on August 10th, 2008. The initial cover art of the volume was created by the series' illustrator Hiro Kanzaki, where it featured main character Kirino Kosaka standing with her arms crossed and wearing a stern expression, while protagonist and older brother Kyosuke Kosaka is shown from behind looking disgruntled. One of the earliest public freakout videos was posted to YouTube on June 2nd, 2008, which featured what appears to be security camera footage of a man destroying several cubicles in an office (shown below). The video was later revealed to be a marketing hoax designed to promote the then-upcoming 2008 action thriller film Wanted. Online videos of fights on public transit became increasingly common in the late 2000s with the rise of video-recording mobile phones and video-sharing sites. The earliest known viral videos of public bus brawls came from the Chinese-speaking web in May 2006 with a video titled "Hong Kong Bus Uncle", which shows 51-year-old Roger Chan berating 23-year-old Elvis Ho on a bus in Hong Kong after being touched on the shoulder. "Separated at birth" images existed outside of the Internet, and may have originated from Spy Magazine. From Wikipedia: The title "Separated at Birth?" was a trademark of Spy Publishing Partners, the publishers of the now defunct Spy Magazine, a monthly publication that published satire, humor, and investigative journalism from 1986 to 1998. The magazine would pair two carefully selected photos of two unrelated famous persons and the juxtaposition would highlight their physical similarities to humorous effect.[1]  The earliest known instance of the image macro was shared on Reddit[4] on March 4th, 2011. The caption alludes to an incestual relationship between the character and his daughter, a common trope employed in redneck humor.[5] Originally uploaded via Quickmeme[1], there are 7891 instances of the series on the site as of May 2012. Following the blog coverage of Redneck Randal, a Memebase[6] user commented on May 11th, 2011 that the identity of the man in the photo is a Texas arcade owner named Cory Clinkscales.[7] Meanwhile, several other commenters claimed that the photo is of a Mississippi resident named Hunter Smith. The image's original site of origin still remains unclear.    On April 6th, 2011 This was posted.A couple hours later,This was created.   Secret Butt Fun was first seen in a commercial for the HUB network's TV show "Pound puppies". In this comericial, the character Niblet, a large sheep dog saying "Secret But Fun" was seen to help declare the show's main direction of a secret club house underneath the local pound that the dogs reside in. Hub appeared for a time to be unaware of the unintended sexual reference. Eventually, someone within the network caught on, and the commercial was pulled from the air. The original song appeared in Season 2, episode 4 "Party Pete", which first aired on the February 21st 2011. In the episode, Mordecai and Rigby are getting ready for a party and rapping along to what they had bought in preparation for it. A picture of Tina Fey with her daughter was posted to Reddit [1] on April 12th, 2011.  On April 7th, 2011, a user of the local Texas message board Hot Pursuit[3] known as al_carl polled other users about the equation 48÷2(9+3), found in his son's homework the previous night. He offered four different answers, 2, 3.14, 219 and 288. The answers were relatively evenly split, with 50 people choosing 2 and 55 choosing 288. The question generated 95 replies of debate about the correct answer.  On July 1st, 2010, the "Attack of the Killer App" episode aired during season six of the animated sitcom Futurama. In the episode, the company Mom Industries releases the eyePhone, a parody of the Apple iPhone. When the protagonist Fry attempts to purchase one at a store, he is warned by the cashier about reception and battery life issues to which he interrupts yelling "Shut up and take my money!" while waving several dollar bills (shown at :26 below): The following day, the German tech blog Crackajack[4] published a post about the episode and included an image macro of Fry with the caption "Shut up and take my money!" Mr. & Mrs. Smith was a 2005 movie directed by Doug Liman and written by Simon Kinberg about a married couple (played by Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie) who discover that they are both assassins who have been hired to kill each other. The highly memorable movie poster was designed by design firm BLT & Associates. The first use of the poster being parodied for the homepage of a personal wedding site, Mr and Mrs Chee[1]. The original artist has yet to be identified, but two of the site's sponsors, Mr and Mrs Michael Tang, have been credited in the site itself, so both may have contributed to the image. As for the wedding couple's identity, their's too is unknown.  The image is a stock photo available for purchase from Corbis called "feuding couple in the bedroom".[1] The date this became available is unknown. It has been claimed that the image was first taken from the Spanish health website Vital Vibe Life. On an article dealing with human menopause and climacteric issues, the image is used to illustrate a troubled person with this problem.[2] On March 21st, 2011, Redditor spawn02000[9] posted a picture of himself to the WTF subreddit, titled "I uploaded my picture to a dating site… So far no hits… :(" [1] It received 1,965 upvotes and made the front page. On the next day, he posted a follow-up image titled "Ok so I changed the picture on the dating site, Still no hits… :("[2], which accumulated 1,265 upvotes. In terms of style, the series can be likened to Vengeance Dad and Karate Kyle which took off on 4chan only a few months prior to the emergence of Dating Site Murderer.      The face was first found on Tumblr on April 6, 2011, with a usable face.       On April 19th, 2011, the first-person puzzle-platform game Portal 2 was released by the video game development and distribution company Valve. During the final boss battle in the game, the player interacts with a group of sphere-shaped robots with unique personalities. One of the robots introduces itself as the "Space Core", a yellow-eyed sphere who constantly repeats the words "space, space, space" and quotes random factoid about space. The same day the game was released, a discussion thread about the Space Core was posted to the Steam[13] forums, where several fans hailed the spherical robot as "quite possibly the best video game character ever."    Although bird images have been altered in many different ways in the past, the earliest thread where bird images were exclusively edited with human arms was in a thread on the Reeelapse Forums[1] titled "Post pictures of birds with arms", created on August 11, 2008.    On April 29th, 2011, Prince William and Kate Middleton officially got married and gave their first kiss on the balcony of Buckingham Palace. When the couple decided to go for another kiss, a little girl was shown to their left, looking very displeased with her hands covered over her ears. The girl was soon identified as a 3-year-old Grace van Cutsem[1], Prince William's goddaughter who accompanied Kate Middleton as the bridesmaid. The UK media reported that she appeared so miserable in the picture because of the heavy commotion and applause surrounding the palace[2]. On Twitter, people started posting tweets by saying things like "somebody on the balcony wasn't impressed by #TheRoyalKiss." The first #RoyalWeddingGirl hashtag associated with the meme was tweeted by Andrew Spearin[3], who photoshopped the girl into the bottom left corner of a photo of Donald Trump giving a speech. The earliest known use of the word birb in this context was on November 17th, 2012, when it was tweeted by the popular bird-themed Twitter BirdsRightsActivist.[1] The tweet received 87 retweets and 83 favorites in three years. The first version is made by Youtuber hoboware in 2009. Based on the 2004 song Call On Me by Swdish producer Eric Prydz, and using clips from David Chappelle's skit "Red Balls", it has garnered over 50 respond videos and more similar derivatives.      Released in 1994, SimCity 2000 was the first major sequel to the original 1989 SimCity. Critically acclaimed and award-winning, the game is still regarded highly to this day, and PC Gamer magazine ranks it as the best SimCity of all time. The board of advisors are often considered an annoying aspect to the game because they repeatedly pop-up to give advice and complain. The transportation advisor is one of the more memorable advisors due to his over-the-top screams in all capital letters. TV Tropes lists this part of the game as a "What the Hell, Hero?" trope.[1] Yet other times, an author will drop some gray into his otherwise flawlessly good guy hero… and have others notice. This can add guilt and remorse to a character as they feel shame for their evil actions, and legitimately have to fight to restore their name, undo the harm, or simply live with the guilt and shame of it. In this case, you can expect to hear some variation of "Haven't you done enough already?" [8]   The video, titled "The Crazy Nastyass Honey Badger (original narration by Randall)", was uploaded by YouTuber czg123[1] on January 18th, 2011. The video features original footage taken from a National Geographic special[2] on the ornery and tough honey badgers, which aired in 2007.     Released as an arcade game by Namco in 2005, The Idolmaster[1] is a successful series of idol training simulation games. Despite being Japan-only, it has spawned numerous sequels and ports to other systems including the Xbox 360, PSP, and Nintendo DS, with many cameos in other Namco Bandai properties such as Ace Combat 6, Taiko no Tatsujin, Beautiful Katamari, and the Tales of series, and has even generated two anime series. In the games, the player takes the role of a producer who must help his/her clients become professional singers in the Japanese music industry. The background theme "Town" appears in all incarnations of the series, and as its namesake suggests, it is played during scenes that take place in the city. The song is commonly credited as being written by Namco composer Go Shiina, but this is unverified.  During the middle of Chapter 6, The Fall, an automated recording is played of the deceased Cave Johnson. It is told that he is the founder of Aperture Science, has spent years as CEO, and is coming up with new inventions and ideas for the future. Some of his ideas backfired, and one even cost him his life. He received a deadly disease which was caused by the contact of Moon Rocks. At first he is optimistic that his researchers will create a vaccine to save him. Unfortunately as time goes by, his optimism fades, and soon becomes enraged. (voice clip shown below quote) "When life gives you lemons, don't make lemonade. Make life take the lemons back! Get mad! I don't want your damn lemons, what the hell am I supposed to do with these? Demand to see life's manager! Make life rue the day it thought it could give Cave Johnson lemons! Do you know who I am? I'm the man who's gonna burn your house down! With the lemons! I'm gonna get my engineers to invent a combustible lemon that burns your house down!"     Written by Adam Mansbach and illustrated by Ricardo Cortés, "Go the Fuck to Sleep"[1] was originally slated for release in late October 2011. However, a PDF copy of the book was leaked onto the web in April, possibly during exchanges of e-mails with a number of booksellers. The term was coined by Harley Morenstein in episode "Candy BBQ" of his YouTube show "EpicMealTime". This episode was uploaded in May 17th, 2011. (the term is used around 1:23 ) Official facebook page of Gay bacon strips: http://www.facebook.com/pages/Gay-Bacon-Strips/121937321222614   Although taking credit for a meme isn't necessary, MrSalvador of Kongregate was the originator of "Myslef Yourslef." The image was the first result when searching "Dave" in Google Images. Now, if you search "Dave Morris" on Google Images, the image used in the meme will come up first.  Anti-humor[1] existed well before the Internet was invented. While anti-humor comes in many forms, one of the most common is the one used in this meme: a joke-like setup followed by a non-punchline. This forms a sort of meta-joke in which ironic humor is found in the lack of any standard form of humor. One of the most well-known anti-humor jokes is the classic: Q:Why did the chicken cross the road? A:To get to the other side! Dating back at least to the mid-1800s, this joke contains no inherent humor within the punchline, and is likely a partial inspiration for this meme.[2] The above is the original photo on which the image macro was based. It was taken by the owner of the hen, professional ophthalmic photographer Marshall E. Tyler,[3] at his home in North Carolina.      The original clip comes from the first episode of the series, broadcast January 12th, 1997.[5] In the original episode, Bobby and Hank are listening to a comedy CD full of fart sound effects (shown below). The first video of this kind was most likely "Hank Hill listens to fart sounds while I play unfitting music" by FlamezV2, uploaded May 22nd, 2009, based on the popular meme Unfitting Music.  In the evening in November 4th 2010, the videos appeared on YouTube. In these 6 videos divided from original 44-minute video, these 2 videos recording the moments that a Chinese fishing boat collided to two Japanese ships got the most attention. Later, Japanese government officially acknowledged that these videos were originally taken by the Japanese coast guard and recorded all the little details about China fishing boat collision boat accident happened in September 7th, 2010.   According to a timeline of rageface origins on Reddit[1], the first instance of 'I Lied' was in a comic posted by Redditor Coveiro titled "I was way evil back then"[3] on May 10th, 2011. The thread reached the front page of the f7u12 subreddit and accumulated 8,753 up votes prior to being archived. A revised version of the face that became common in other rage comics began with the second ‘I Lied’[4] thread made by Coveiro on May 14th, 2011.   The earliest known instance can be found on 9gag with a two-pane illustration of "how people view me after I say I'm Russian," which was posted on June 1st, 2011. The same image was uploaded in a personal gallery by Flickr user Igor Ryabushkin[9] the following day. On this video, the questions were all about hair styling. The video became instantly viral because of the first two interviewed children, where the one on the left (Natalija) hits herself on the head for unknown reason. Then, couple of children after, the same girls are shown and the one on the left asks her friend Petra: "Isechesh kosu da budesh chelav? Boze Petra." (eng. "You want to cut your hair to be bald? Oh my God, Petra"), hence the name of the meme. Later on, when the children are asked "What things are there in the hair salon?", one of them answers "Shampon!" (eng. Shampoo) seemingly very proud of her answer and out loud. Lots of remixes are available on YouTube as well. On June 6th, 2011, French videogame publisher Ubisoft held a special press conference in commemoration of the company's 25th anniversary, which featured a series of videos depicting what current Ubisoft franchises would have looked like had they been produced 25 years ago. Throughout the screening portion of the event, the host Mr. Caffeine prefaced each video with his best approximation of a flashback sound effect coupled with a special hand gesture to imitate what he perceived to be the sound of a time machine. This sound effect is commonly referred to as "doodly doodly doop"[5] which may have been a vague reference to the flashback sound "diddly-doot" originally heard in the 1992 comedy film Wayne's World[12]: The rest of Mr. Caffeine's act was filled with other hilariously bad lines like, "and this absolutely epic fail right here. Yikes!," "Poop on your toothpaste," "Yes, I'm not afraid of a few dick jokes," and frequent mispronounciations of Tom Clancy's name as "Tom Cuh-lancy".   The 2011 Vancouver Stanley Cup Riot took place on Wednesday June 15th after the Vancouver Canucks lost to the Boston Bruins in Game 7 of the Stanley Cup finals. During the riots, a photo of a couple kissing on the ground with several riot police in the frame was taken by photographer Richard Lam[5] for Getty Images.     Argentina, compared to other South American countries, has a high percentage of the Caucasian population, due to the low amount of native groups that lived in the area, high amount of immigration from European countries in the post-independence era and a low amount of African slaves.[1] This created a cultural phenomenon within the population of the country, which may claim to be "whiter" (or more European) than other South American and Latin American countries. This image macro meme originated in a thread entitled, "Spike's Friendzone", on the /pony/ board of Ponychan. It is primarily a My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic sub-meme. The Original Poster wished to discuss the relationship between Rarity and Spike, as it seemed to him that Rarity had to be aware of Spike's affections for her and that she was just using him for slave labor. As the thread continued, it became a discussion about how Spike covets Rarity because she is like a diamond and dragons covet valuable and rare things. Then the conversation went on to suggest that Spike, when he would become older, would either stuff Rarity to keep her intact and beautiful forever, or mate with her to produce more ponies like Rarity, aka more diamonds. Since dragons are known to be able to practically successfully mate with anything in western fantasy, this idea did not seem so strange. It should be noted that the user, Geldon, was inspired by this discussion to write a grimdark fanfic about Spike in his middle years thinking back on his life and when he paid a taxidermist to keep Rarity lifelike after her death. The story is entitled "The Centerpiece of My Collection." In the story, it is suggested that Rarity is vain enough that she would even help Spike organize this macabre plan.   Origin is unknown (Entry Editor Comment: I am 99% sure it is /b/ but I can't find it and probably never will, so unknown origin …) First recorded appearance is on Newgrounds forums by the user Shabbo with the title "Draw something to save yourself![1]"  Though there have been many flash mobs involving dancing, the first real choreographed one was done in March of 2008 by Improv Everywhere. The flash mob broke out into a musical number about needing a napkin in the middle of a Los Angeles food court.    Between March and April 2003, Jiang M, Xin J, Zou Q, and Shen JW from the science department of the J Zhejiang University published a paper titled, "A research on the relationship between ejaculation and serum testosterone level in men" to PubMed.[1] The study had 28 volunteers stop masturbating for an extended length of time, before and after which their testosterone levels were tested. Researchers found that on the seventh day of abstinence, volunteers saw a peak in testosterone level reaching over 45.7% of the baseline. On June 20th, 2011 the /r/NoFap[3] subreddit was created for the purpose of holding "no fap" challenges, where members of the community document their experiences abstaining from masturbation. On June 21st, 2011, a now-deleted Redditor posted a link to the study to /r/todayilearned,[2] garnering over 1,800 upvotes and 2,000 comments in roughly 10 years (shown below, left). The post inspired a number of comments joking about what people would be like if they stopped masturbating, along with people implying they were going to accept the challenge (examples shown below, right).     The phrase came from Brock's Dub[1], a parody of Rebecca Black's Friday. As one of Rebecca's friends was waving her hand up and down, Brock dubbed it with the phrase "MY HAND IS A DOLPHIN!" As the video's popularity grew, Brock Baker, the original creator of the video, went on the sell T-shirts bearing the phrase[2], as well as "Get the F*ck Over Here" and "Everybody's Russian," two other catchphrases from the video. A little more than a month after his original video, Brock dubbed a video of babies talking to each other, and included "my hand is a dolphin" calling it an internet meme. It can be heard at 0:45 seconds in.  The earliest known reference to "first world problems" can be found in the lyrics of Canadian alt rock band Matthew Good Band's 1995 song titled "Omissions of the Omen," which was included as a bonus track on their full-length debut album Last of the Ghetto Astronauts: "And somewhere around the world / Someone would love to have my first world problems / Kill the moon and turn out the sun / Lock your door and load your gun / Free at last now the time has come to choose." The first Urban Dictionary[1] entry for the term was submitted on August 10th, 2005: First World Problems: Problems from living in a wealthy, industrialized nation that third worlders would probably roll their eyes at. On June 16th, 2011, a photograph of three Chinese officials standing on a road was posted via China's Huili County Government official website, accompanied by the caption: “County mayor Li Ningyi and vice-mayor Tang Xiaobing are inspecting the newly constructed country road at Lihong Town." The picture certainly portrayed the men, and the road, but the officials appeared to be levitating several inches above the tarmac. As photographic fakery goes it was astonishingly clumsy.   In the date of 6/28/2011 a employee of @morroida discovered a governmental site that was used like a online backup. In the site, Luiz Carlos hosted pornographic files, pirated music, pictures and e-books. Eh Nois was the name of a picture that was hosted on the site (eh-nois.png).    Although the original use of the term is unknown, it is likely the term came from /b/ in the late 2000's as an insult for bad posters (or shitposters) assumed to be underage in the Summer. A advice animal for the phrase originated in 2010, and created multiple derivatives.  The music video was first uploaded via YouTube on February 10th, 2011, but it didn't gain viral momentum until a month later when the popular The Daily What[1] posted the video on March 11th, 2011. CNN Marquees blog reported that Black’s music video was produced by Ark Music Factory, a California-based video company that was also behind similar teen-pop videos like Alana Lee’s “Butterflies” and Kaya’s “Can’t Get You Out of My Mind” .[2]    The exact origins are not known but research suggests that standing first became popular around 250 B.C. Crouching and scooting one's ass across the ground seemed to be the most common drawing fads prior to standing. Much evidence exists of cavemen standing: Scientists debate whether dinosaurs practiced standing before this time. New evidence suggests this is true: Real life rare footage of standing The spot interview with the man was conducted and recorded by journalist Fabián García for the local news site Nayarit en Linea[2] and uploaded via YouTube on June 23rd, 2011. The video shows an intoxicated man rambling about his supernatural power to foresee the future using the power of "FUA," which he described as a "method personal growth." The man apparently approached the journalist to interview him, because he wanted to send greetings to his wife and sons, whom he claimed to be living in Mexico City. Recorded bits of the interview appeared for the first time in Noche de Emergencias, on Nayarit en Línea. Prior to this broadcast, other interviews with teporochos, a colloquial label for alcoholics loitering in the streets, have been subject to parodies on the Mexican web, such as the Canaca Guy and the "Tengo Miedo" Guy. On June 28th, 2011, Argentinian football club River Plate played against the B-league underdogs Belgrano de Córdoba for the second leg of play-off match known as "Promoción," in which the losing team would be relegated to Nacional B league. The game ended in a 1–1 draw, leading to the relegation of River Plate to the B-league for the first time in its club history. The match came to a halt during injury time of the second half after a riot erupted in the stadium. Meanwhile, River Plate supporters watching the game via broadcast were equally shocked and disappointed by the game's result, including this man whose reactions to his favorite team's loss were videotaped by his family members. Since being uploaded by YouTuber videtta[1] on July 8th, the angry soccer fan’s hilariously vulgar rant reached 1.7 million views within todays and over 7 million views in the span of three weeks. The below is an English-subtitled version of the original upload:  The video titled "Fail like a boss – EPIC" was uploaded to YouTube by user karpinremo on July 18th, 2011. It took place on the Estrada Atlântica road in Caldas da Rainha, Portugal. Jedidiah Kerman is one of the aforementioned kerbals. During early versions, he was one of only three crew members to ride in the players creations. In later versions, other Kerbals could be recruited to your space program, but he and the other members of the "Original three", Bill and Bob Kerman, were probably going to be the first Kerbals launched, due to there presence at the top of the list of kerbals. Even more so, Jeb was at the very top, so he was almost always the first.  The iconic image behind PogChamp was first seen in a Cross Counter TV video from 2010, which features an outtake of streamer and professional Street Fighter player Ryan Gutierrez, better known as Gootecks, making an exaggerated face with his mouth and eyes wide open in surprise after the cameraman bumped into his tripod and shook the camera (alongside fellow streamer Mike Ross). On November 26th, 2010, the outtake was uploaded to YouTube found below. Though popularized on Twitch, the image is rumored to have originally surfaced on the website 4chan before spreading elsewhere. The image was used on 4chan within the gaming community shortly after the 2011 “Pogs Championship” video (shown below) was uploaded when users stripped stills of Gutierrez’s shocked face and began using these to express surprise or excitement throughout the website in a number of threads.  On April 21st, 2011, sixteen days after the original "Nyan Cat" video was uploaded to YouTube, Cheezburger CEO Ben Huh conceived the idea for a reversed version of Nyan Cat and it was created by SenorGIF blogger[1] Frankie Crescioni.[8] Huh chose the name "Tac Nayn" for the black cat, who appears to be flying through a red background with floating skulls. However, it was not the first Nyan Cat parody to use the backwards name: a video uploaded to YouTube the day before by AmazingPurpleCat[3] reversed the colors and rotation of the original but did not take off. The rivalry between Nyan Cat and Tac Nayn also draws parallel from the Longcat vs. Tacgnol mythology, which dates back to 2007.    On July 2011 the car manufacturer Nissan aired in Brazil a TV ad of a car (NISSAN FRONTIER) basically the guy bought a car that had "ponys" instead of "horsepower".. it wasn't strong enough! He swears at the ponys when he kicks the car, something like: "DAMN YOU, PONYS"! Pink ponys appear from inside the car and start singing a song to make fun of him. At the end of the video the poney turn out to be diabolic and talk about "The pony curse", you must send the video to ten friends, otherwise the song will stick to you brain forever! Translated Version(turn annotations on) Original Video The original video quickly went viral and has to date 5.6 Million views.     This meme seems to have originated in Twitter, with the Twitter Feed "White Girl Problems"[1]. The feed consists of many humors examples of what a wealthy white teenage girl would consider to be an issue in everyday life.  The Pop-Tart Cat animation was posted on the daily comics site LOL-COMICS[1] run by illustrator Chris Torres, also known as prguitarman, on April 2nd, 2011. The original drawing was based on his own Russian Blue cat, Marty, and was drawn after receiving two separate suggestions for a cat and a pop tart during a Red Cross charity drawing event on Livestream[28]. Prior to the Pop-Tart Cat, prguitarman had already gained a relatively large audience with a few other instances of comics circulating on the web. The GIF animation was also reblogged via Tumblr[2] on April 2nd, 2011, accumulating more than 3,000 notes (likes & reblogs) in its first two weeks: On April 5th, 2011, YouTuber saraj00n posted a video titled "Nyan Cat"[3], using comic artist prguitarman's Pop-Tart Cat animation set to the well-known Japanese Vocaloid song Nyanyanyanyanyanyanya by Japanese artist Daniwell-P looping in the background, Although the song had been originally composed for Hatsune Miku to sing, The version used in the video was of the cover sung by the Utauloid Momo Momone. The video (shown below) gained more than one million views in its first two weeks.     The original post comes from the Australian website GotGames.com.au forums, where it was first posted on July 19th, 2011 by user Wankee. The post contained the following message and a picture of the dog.[11]    The series is based on a stock photograph titled "Optimistic Man," uploaded by photographer Justin Horrocks on January 3rd, 2007. The first instance of the image macro, which read "pops collar to protect neck from sunburn," surfaced years later on Quickmeme.[1] It was subsequently posted to Reddit[2] on August 8th, 2011, where it reached the front page of the advice animals subreddit with 1,652 up votes. Tako Luka was created by pixiv user Sangatsu Youka (三月八日), also known as Sanpachi (さんぱち).[1] The archetype of Tako Luka was a headshot drawn of Luka uploaded to pixiv on January 6th, 2009 (shown below, left).[2] Then, by getting inspiration of octopus from her pink hair, it finally mutated to Tako Luka in the two days later (shown below, right).[3][4] Tako Luka came into the Vocaloid fandom under the "Item War", a Vocaloid flamewar within the fandom to determine the next Vocaloid, Luka's, character item like Miku's leek and Rin/Ren's road roller, as this had become a tradition in the fandom. Later, the creator said Tako Luka's octopus hands which can handle many items together also had caricatural meaning against the war.[5]  Hatsune Miku (初音ミク) is an application developed by Crypton Future Media. Released on August 31st, 2007, using Yamaha's Vocaloid 2 technology and voice samples of Japanese voice actress Saki Fujita, the program allows the user to synthesize and optimize the singer's voice to sing any tune. It was first introduced to the Japanese market with an official anime character, who has since reached iconic status within Otaku culture as well as mainstream J-pop and online video culture as well. The Japanese video sharing service Nico Nico Douga (NND) became known as the ground zero of Hatsune Miku sensation on September 4th, 2007, when NND user Otomania posted a vocaloid remix of another remix series "Leekspin" featuring a heavily-deformed version of Miku, now known as "Hachune Miku". The video was well received in the video-sharing community, inspiring other NND artists to create and share their own remixes, cover songs, and fan art, as well as original compositions using the software. Since its debut, the original video has gained over 3,250,000 views (as of August 2011). The song was first uploaded to YouTube on February 24th 2011 and was made available for purchase on the Australian iTunes store. However, the video did not receive significant views until Luke O'Dell appeared on the Australian version XFactor on August 31, 2011. He first sang the Kelly Clarkson song, "Since U Been Gone." The judges did not enjoy his performance so he asked if he could sing his own composition, "Introvert, Extrovert."   The original image originates from a thread on 2-ch.ru, the Russian equivalent of 4chan, posted as a response to someone with girl problems, thus explaining his command to "be a man". The exact origin and creator of the face is unknown, although searches for the meme became noticeable around late 2011. The oldest known date tracing back the origins of the Desk Flip character stems from a post on June 18th, 2011, when it was added to the Rage Maker[1] site under the "Angry" category (seen below). As with the original post of the Rage Face, the first meme to use Desk Flip is unknown, but on August 18th, 2012, early examples of it being used in such a fashion are found on Meme Generator[2] across numerous image macros (shown below).  The line originated from a scene in the film A Few Good Men wherein court martial lawyer Daniel Kaffee (played by Tom Cruise) exposes Colonel Nathan R. Jessup’s (played by Jack Nicholson) false testimony surrounding the death of a Marine named Santiago (shown below). When pressed by Kaffee to tell the truth, Colonel Jessup abruptly yells "You can't handle the truth!" Kaffee: Colonel Jessup, did you order the Code Red?! Judge: You don't have to answer that question! Jessup: I'll answer the question. You want answers? Kaffee: I think I'm entitled! Jessup: You want answers?! Kaffee: I want the truth! Jessup: You can't handle the truth! Son, we live in a world that has walls, and those walls have to be guarded by men with guns. Who's gonna do it? You? You, Lieutenant Weinberg? I have a greater responsibility than you can possibly fathom. You weep for Santiago and you curse the Marines. You have that luxury. You have the luxury of not knowing what I know, that Santiago's death, while tragic, probably saved lives. And my existence, while grotesque and incomprehensible to you, saves lives! You don't want the truth, because deep down in places you don't talk about at parties, you want me on that wall. You need me on that wall. We use words like "honor", "code", "loyalty". We use these words as the backbone of a life spent defending something. You use them as a punchline. I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very freedom that I provide, and then questions the manner in which I provide it! I would rather you just said "thank you", and went on your way. Otherwise, I suggest you pick up a weapon, and stand a post. Either way, I don't give a damn what you think you are entitled to! Kaffee: Did you order the Code Red? Jessup: I did the job that--- Kaffee: Did you order the Code Red?!! Jessup: YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT I DID!![2] The scene was subsequently parodied on television numerous times, including Season 5 Episode 14 of the comedy series Seinfeld (shown below, left) aired on February 10th, 1994 and a 1998 commercial for the fast food chain Burger King (shown below, right). The earliest known online parody of the quote was uploaded by YouTuber and comedian Brandon Hardesty on February 12th, 2007, in which Hardesty reenacts the scene by playing the parts of both Kaffee and Jessup (shown below). Within seven years, the video gained over 277,000 views and 1,700 comments.     The first noted instance of Hipster Barista was uploaded on August 24, 2011 as a Quickmeme[2] submission with the caption “I got this tattoo for my love of coffee / I got this one because it’s ironic.” On August 25th, 2011, a link to another Quickmeme submission was posted in Reddit's /r/AdviceAnimals[8] subreddit, which featured the caption "Che Guevara changed my life / Manager at Starbucks" and received 2,872 up votes (as of September 6th). Animated by Ben Smallman and composed by Todd Bryanton, "asdfmovie4" was uploaded by YouTuber Tomska[3] on September 2nd, 2011. The video reel consists of short cutscenes featuring various stick-figure characters with one-liners, mostly depicting random and absurd scenarios like throwing cheese at a flying saucer: The phrase "I'm gonna do an Internet" can be heard in the opening scene: The video was well-received on YouTube, gaining over 1.5 million views within the first day of upload. As of September 13th, 2011, the video has been viewed over 4.3 million times and given the recognition of #1 top rated video of the month in Comedy category. Prior to the release of this video, YouTuber Tomska first became widely known as the origin of the catchphrase I like train.      While folklores have been an essential part of cultural traditions for many centuries, the term "urban legend" began appearing in print publications as early as 1968 and became widespread through a series of books written by English professor Jan Harold Brunvand in the early 1980s. Since then, the word has become closely associated with short horror or mystery stories set in modern day. Starting in the 1990s, chain letter e-mails quickly emerged as the primary medium for sharing such stories on the Internet. [1] There are many forms of chain email that threaten death or the taking of one's soul by telling tales of other's deaths, such as the Katu Lata Kulu chain email, stating that if it is not forwarded, the receivers of the message will be killed by the spirit. Another involved an email involving a homicidal Mickey Mouse, who will intrude the recipient's domain to kill him or her unless sent to the number of recipients (25). Any lower they will suffer death, injury, paranoia, and bad luck. The Internet slang term "creepypasta," which is derived from copypasta, did not enter the 4chan community's vernacular until mid-2007, with the earliest known archived thread[2] dating back to July 6th. The earliest known instance of the phrase was posted on October 28th, 2006, on the 4chan board /v/ (Video Games) by an anonymous user. The thread begins with the original poster seemingly asking the question in earnest, before the second reply offers the meme's punchline as an explanation, derailing the thread entirely (seen below). This exchange occurred at a time when the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 had both launched recently and console wars were commonplace on the site, with fans of the different systems arguing which was the best. Thus, it is possible that the original poster was a Nintendo or Sony fan trying to mock the system, but it's also possible he was fully aware of the nonsensical nature of the joke and was intentionally baiting other posters on the site. Encyclopedia Dramatica[1] corroborates /v/ as the place where the meme originated and claims that it spread from there to other boards on 4chan. Attempts have been made to make sense of the phrase, such as well-known depictions of Michael Jackson doing a 360-degree spin and then moonwalking away from the Xbox 360, using sprites from the Sega Genesis game Michael Jackson's Moonwalker (shown below).  The phrase was initially used in the first episode of series 5, The Eleventh Hour,[1] which aired April 3rd 2010. It was both Matt Smith's first full episode as the Eleventh Doctor and the first episode with Steven Moffatt as head writer and executive producer.[2] The Doctor says the phrase after his future travel partner, Amy Pond, critiques his outfit.    The "Celebrities Without Eyebrows"[1] Tumblr blog was created on December 10th, 2009. For unknown reasons, the Tumblr blog migrated to the Blogspot[2] platform on March 22nd, 2010, where it updated regularly until September 9th, 2013. The creator revealed the inspiration behind the page in a post on May 21st, 2011. "I saw a photoshopped pic of Rob Pattinson without eyebrows (the first pic I ever posted to this blog!) and started wondering what other celebs would look like without eyebrows. And here we are! Although I need new celebs to de-eyebrow. Anyone got any suggestions?"     The earliest known time-lapse montage of the Earth titled "Looking Down on Earth from the ISS HD Timelapse"[3] was uploaded on September 2nd, 2011 by American science educator James Drake (YouTube handle: yesterday2221), who used more than 600 photographs of North and South Americas from The Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth[4], NASA's online database of photographs of Earth taken by astronauts during their missions onboard the International Space Station.[2] Weeks later on September 15th, Drake uploaded a polished version of his previous video titled "What does it feel like to fly over planet Earth?" which reached over 3 million viewers within the first five days of upload.[1]   The earliest known use of time-lapsing has been credited to the 1897 silent film Carrefour De L'Opera directed by Georges Méliès.[1] In the early 1900s, time-lapsed films of biological organisms were produced by French filmmaker and biologist Jean Comandon, British naturalist F. Percy Smith and Russian-American photographer and biologist Roman Vishniac. In the 1920s, German filmmaker Arnold Fanck used time-lapse techniques in a series of mountaineering films. In the 1950s, time-lapse footage of plants growing was featured in the Walt Disney documentary film Secrets of Life. In the 1980s, the PBS television series NOVA aired a full episode on time-lapse and slow motion photography. By the mid 1990s, advents in digital photography and video-editing software programs led to an expansion of time-lapse photography into videos on the web.  On April 13th, 2010, a post titled "The Alot is Better Than You at Everything"[1] was published to Hyperbole and a Half, and described a coping mechanism for witnessing the grammatical error combining the phrase "a lot" into the word "alot." The post was accompanied by several illustrations of how she imagines the creature: The Return of Harmony is a two part episode of My Little Pony Friendship is Magic. Rarity, while under the influence of Discord in The Return of Harmony Part 1, digs out a large diamond from a rock wall with three gems reminiscent of her cutie mark embedded on it. Only Rarity sees it as a diamond. When Twilight arrives, the "diamond" is only a simple boulder. Rarity refuses to part with it for the majority of both episodes. At Twilight's library, Rarity remains outside, and says she's on to Twilight's plan to steal "Tom" from her, addressing the boulder by name. While the original iteration of the meme remains unidentified, some of the earliest instances began appearing at the top of the comments sections after YouTube unveiled its comment rating system in early 2010. Since the comment dually served as a viewer's feedback for the uploader and a warning for the viewers, "RIP Headphone Users" and its variations were frequently placed above the rest of user comments. On May 25th, 1977, 20th Century Fox released the film Star Wars in the United States.[1] In the film, the character Luke Skywalker finds a secret message from Princess Leia (portrayed by Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher, respectively) recorded on a hologram and hidden in the droid R2-D2 (shown below). The video clip comes from a scene in the 1995 comedy film Billy Madison, in which the host of an academic decathlon (played by James Downey) insults the character Billy Madison (played by Adam Sandler) during the contest. "What you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul." The earliest known video using the scene was uploaded by YouTuber ladder09 on August 29th, 2007, featuring the incoherent response of Miss Teen USA South Carolina followed by the insult clip (shown below). Within six years, the video accumulated over 160,000 views and 600 comments.  According to descriptions in the first template image, this idea was proposed by a deviantART (dA) user rosalarian[1] (shown below, left), and her friends brushed up the idea and made a blank template file on December 18th, 2009 (shown below, right).[2] While the exact origin of the practice is uncertain, the practice became regular as video upload services like YouTube became available, along with their provided simplified embed codes. One of the earliest popular examples of a forum video was Shut The Fuck Up which was uploaded by Youtube user Jetsetlemming on August 18th, 2007. Within 7 years, the video has gathered more than 1.4 million views. One of the earliest known videos labeled with the title "Forum Weapon" was uploaded by Youtube user Bound4Earth titled Ultimate Insult (Academic Decathlon)[Forum Weapon] (the title was later changed to "You're going to get raped (Trigger Warning)" on November 26th, 2009. Within 5 years, the video has gathered over 5.9 million views.  Bio Force Ape is a game developed for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1991 by the japanese developer SETA Corporation. Although the game was showcased at the Consumer Electronics Show in June of 1991 and even previewed at a Nintendo Power issue, the game was eventually cancelled in 1992. This game, along with other unreleased titles were usually discussed on online gaming fansites and message boards. Although many of these games were discovered by collectors, Bio Force Ape remained in mystery since no copies were ever found. The original photo was taken by photographer Andrea Nelson at the Animal Shelter of the Wood River Valley in Hailey, Idaho. The dog's real name was "Smilin' Trudy" and was written about in an article on the Sun Valley[11] website on March 17th, 2008. The photo was posted to Reddit[4] by user laketrash in a thread titled "Guilty Smile" on September 9th, 2011 and accumulated 7,299 up votes in less than 2 months . The first known instance of the macro was subsequently posted to Quickmeme[5] the same day with the caption "Paws wet / stays on carpet." Siri was first announced on October 4th, 2011 as a part of iOS5 update during the Let's Talk iPhone keynote presentation. A promotional video was uploaded onto YouTube and featured on Apple's website: On the same day, people began creating remixes of the Siri commercial. SiriFunny.com[3] was created on October 5th, 2011 and StuffSiriSaid.com[10] was purchased on October 7th in anticipation. The single topic Tumblr blog Shit That Siri Says[4] was created on October 12th, 2011. Siri first became available to public with the release of iPhone 4S on October 14th.  While the original stock photo has yet to be found, the picture of the cat was first used in a macro on Trollcats[1] on April 2nd, 2010. One of the first image macros with the cat's head superimposed on the red and yellow background appeared on MemeGenerator[3] and FunnyJunk[2] on June 6th, 2010. After the creation of YouTube in 2005, there has been literally billions of comments, making it difficult to even begin to calculate when the first YouTube Comments meme was ever posted. However, the earliest known comment posted on YouTube is "Interesting…." by YouTube user COBALTGRUV.[6] This comment is the first known example of a comment marked as spam on YouTube.[5] In late October of 2011, a student organization at Ohio University named "Students Teaching Against Racism in Society"[8] (STARS) launched a campaign to raise awareness about racially insensitive Halloween costumes. On October 21st, the president of the organization posted several images of awareness posters on her Tumblr blog.[1] Adam Butcher announced[1] the production of Internet Story via his website sometime in 2009, describing it as a story about a video blogger on a public treasure hunt as told through videos, animations, blogs and news articles. In June 2009, Butcher claimed[2] he found a link to a website for a similar public treasure hunt titled “Al1’s Nine Grand Quest”[3], which was later revealed to have been created by Butcher himself earlier that year in March. He also created a YouTube account[5] for Fortress, the fictional video blogger on the quest, to host the videos shown in the film. Internet Story was completed in April 2010[4] and uploaded to Vimeo[5] on July 31st.  The first image macro was submitted to the r/atheism[2] subreddit on October 23rd, 2011. The original image comes from the cover of the 16th issue of the DC Comics series "Lucifer"[4] written by Mike Carey. The cover illustration depicts the character Lucifer and was drawn by artist Christopher Moeller[5].     On October 10th, 2011, episode one called "Sign Up" of the anime series Future Diary (jap. 未来日記, Mirai Nikki) premiered in Japan.[1] In one scene of the episode, yandere character Yuno Gasai promises the character Yukiteru "Yukki" Amano, her object of desire, that she will protect him, with Yuno holding her face in her hands and her face flushing (clip shown below). In the 2006 manga series, the respective panel appears in chapter two "The 12 Future Diary Holders" (shown below).[2] The photo originated from an iStockPhoto[1] entry submitted by Pakistani photographer Aman Khan in March 2007. While the name of the model is not listed, tags on the photo set indicate that the man may be a fifty-year-old Pashtun Muslim. On January 4th, 2011, Redditor hi7en submitted the image with the caption "I am da bomb / at making falafels" in a post titled "Introducing ordinary Muslim man."[6] The thread received a total of 454 up votes prior to being archived. Although it remains unverified, the original copypasta has been attributed to 4chan, dating back to early 2009. The earliest known story ending with spaghetti falling out of one’s pocket was posted on the Body Building Forums [5]by uboodiff on September 13th, 2010. Titled "Most embarassing day," the original poster recounted a story about humiliating himself at the check-out line in a Halloween store. The thread received 33 responses the same day, with many users commenting on the absurdity of carrying around cooked spaghetti.  The Tumblr page was created was on August 31st, 2011 and the first post featured a man with a brown pony tail and handle-bar mustache wearing a white turtle neck. The post has accumulated 18 notes as of November 9th, 2011.      The romantic vampire film Twilight, based off the novel by Stephanie Meyer, premiered in Los Angeles, California on November 17th, 2008. The leading female role of Isabella Swan was played by Kristen Stewart who falls in love with the vampire Edward Cullen played by Robert Pattinson. According to the entertainment news site Variety[11], the film grossed over $7 million in sales from the midnight shows on opening night. It has received mixed reviews with a Rotten Tomatoes[13] score of 49% and a Metacritic[12] score of 56 as of November 18th, 2011. One of the earliest known comic instances comes from the first-person shooter video game enthusiast Global Fortress[1] forums on June 20th, 2009. It featured a 4-pane comic using screen captures from a science classroom scene in the first Twilight film.    Good Guy Greg is rumored to have started on 4chan's /b/ (random) board but an archived thread has yet to be found. On April 26th, 2011, the template photo was uploaded to the image remixing site Canvas[1] with the description "This is Good Guy Greg." The Canvas thread received over 570 remix replies within 11 months. Digimon Adventures (named Digimon or Digimon, Digital Monsters in the US) is a popular children's anime series that was created by the animation studio Toei and aired on Fuji TV in 1999.[1] The series consists of young kids who partner up with monsters named Digimon (short for Digital Monsters) and go on various adventures from saving the virtual world (called Digital World) to saving the real world. Digimon Adventures 02 is the sequel of Digimon Adventures which takes place a few years after the first season. Although it has it's own cast of Chosen Children (Digidestined in the US version), the first season cast returns as teenagers who act as mentors for the new cast. Digimon Adventures was in the early wave of anime series that became popular in the US. It shared a rivalry with Pokémon in the monster raising genre. However, even though Pokémon was undoubtedly more popular, Digimon is still very clearly remembered. Many users on /a/ state that Digimon shaped their childhood view of anime. And this is probably why Sorato still very easily triggers rage to this day. The famous scene happened in episode 38 titled "A Very Digi-Christmas" (named "Holy Night the Big Digimon Reunion!" in Japan) which aired in the US March 24, 2001. Taichi meets Sora who is going to a concert hosted by Yamato's band to give Yamato a present. Taichi takes this opportunity to make a very awkward attempt to try to hang out with Sora who politely turns him down by saying she'd rather go to the concert. Afterwards, it is very heavily implied that Sora is dating Yamato.   The first instance of these chain videos, "Hastily Made Cleveland Tourism," (shown below, left) was uploaded to YouTube on April 14th, 2009, followed by its sequel (shown below, right) two weeks later. Both of the videos were uploaded by Cleveland-based comedian Mike Polk[1] and quickly went viral, with each video amassing four million views since the upload date.             Due to 4chan’s lack of a built-in archival system, the original green text story is unknown. Previously archived threads on the now-defunct Chanarchive indicated that green text threads began appearing in early 2010, the earliest of which contained several stories sharing various awkward moments in the /r9k/[2] (robot9001) board posted on March 3rd, 2010.  In The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, the town guard non-player characters (NPCs) have several stock lines they will repeat when the player walks near them, including a bewildered statement about "curved swords", a patronizing statement about "sweetroll" theft, and the melancholy reminiscing of the past "I used to be an adventurer like you, then I took an arrow in the knee." The repetition of this stock line throughout the game led the players to reference it in gaming forums and imageboards. On November 11th, 2011, the same day Skyrim was released, the phrase was referenced on the site GameFAQs[1] in a Skyrim forum thread titled “I used to be an adventurer like you.”[1]  On August 29th, 2011, Youtube user "Tpoyle1996"[2] uploaded a video of the Team Fortress 2 character Red Heavy, edited to where only his arms and head were showing. As the song played, Heavy would swing his arms on the down beat, and singing the same tune: The video, since receiving 170,000+ views, is a video response to Youtube user R33MIX's[3] video "Rainbows", which features the same song. Rick Lee is a 45-year-old NYPD Community Affairs Detective in the 1st Precinct whose photos were taken at the Occupy Wall Street protests and posted to Twitter[1][2] on October 10th, 2011. Three days later, Gawker editor Adrien Chen posted a photo of Lee to his personal Tumblr[3], which received over 1,300 notes. Chen had seen Lee in action while covering the Radiohead show[4] hoax at Zuccotti Park on September 30th, witnessing him flash a badge from under his cardigan sweater.  Most likely derived from the male counterpart Derp, Derpina began appearing in rage comics as early as 2010. One of the first documented uses of the name in a rage comic was posted in a “Memes of 4chan” thread[7] on the PokerStrategy forums on February 9th, 2011.    Unlimited Blade Works was first introduced in the 2004 visual novel game Fate/stay night, specifically in one of the game's story routes under the same name as the noble phantasm.[10] The noble phantasm is a reality marble that acts as a magical factory for creating replicas of various weapons including other noble phantasms. To summon the reality marble, Archer must use an incantation to facilitate the invocation. The incantation reads: "I am the Bone of my Sword Steel is my Body and Fire is my Blood. I have created over a Thousand Blades, Unknown to Death, Nor known to Life. Have withstood Pain to create many Weapons Yet those Hands will never hold Anything. So, as I Pray-- Unlimited Blade Works" Shirou Emiya has an alternate version of the incantation which he uses to summon the reality marble. The incantation is as follows: "I am the Bone of my Sword Steel is my Body and Fire is my Blood I have created over a Thousand Blades Unaware of Loss, Nor aware of Gain. Withstood Pain to create Weapons, Waiting for one’s Arrival I have no Regrets. This is the only Path My whole life was Unlimited Blade Works" The original image macro was first posted in August 2011 on We Heart It [1] and started gaining traction on tumblr in early fall of 2011. Parodies started appearing in October, gaining more popularity into November.     The first post was made on May 1st, 2011 when blogger Foster Huntington[2] posted his collection[3] of items including a shirt that belonged to his grandfather, a shell from Nicaragua and an external hard drive with his photography on it. Users have continued to submit images in the same style, providing their name, age, location, occupation, and a text list of the items in the photograph.   The original comic was posted to the webcomic blog SB Board[9] by user Henry Lawson on October 16th, 2011. It featured a conversation between the Breaking Bad characters Walt and Jesse about cooking meth to provide for Walt's family. On October 25th, then newly-created “Chili P, Yo” Tumblr[12] began featuring similar comics that used the original SB board submission as an exploitable template. Three days later, the “Breaking Bad Comics” Tumblr[1] was created and hit the 1,000 followers mark by November 6th.[13] Within the first two months, the Tumblr accumulated over 200 posts.  Although the captioned image series gained momentum through Spongebob Squarepants related posts in the second half of 2011, the earliest mention of the phrase "Fuck Logic" can be found in Björk's 1995 song "Sweet Intuition"[1]: "Fuck logic, fuck logic / bravo to instinct / and sweet intuition." Another anecdotal account suggests the phrase became associated with scientific impossibility after a forum discussion over the health effects of unshielded exposure to solar radiation in outer space. A YouTube video titled "Buzz Aldrin: Fuck Radiation" has been attributed to the phrase as well, although the video is no longer available.  The main source footage for this mashup meme is OK Go's music video "A Million Ways"[1] which was originally premired in 2005 (shown below, left). Meanwhile, the earliest instance that made people notice its high flexibility was uploaded to NND on August 16th, 2007 (shown below, right). However, this originator featuring Yatta! hadn't been able to reach masses. Ginger Man originated from 4chan's /b/ in late December of 2011. The original thread portrayed a screenshot of a Facebook page with a group of people with an arrow pointing to "Ginger Guy" at the bottom Original Thread-Chanarchive (NSFW) . The original screen capture of the boy comes from a scene in the 2005 dark comedy film The Chumscrubber, in which the character Charlie is shown wielding a bloody knife (shown at 1:05 below). On August 27th, 2011, an "Angry School Boy" Quickmeme[2] page was launched, with the first instance featuring the caption "Mom asks if I need to go pee pee in front of my friends / Mom must die" (shown below). The same day, Redditor gtw08 submitted the image macro to the /r/AdviceAnimals[4] subreddit. The anime series Working'!! premiered in Japan on October 1st, 2011 as the second season of the adaptation of the comedy manga series Working!!, with the show's ending credits debuting in its first episode. During the mid-way point of the credits, characters Aoi Yamada and Hiroomi Souma are shown playing their tambourines in-sync with each other while slowly sliding in view from behind a disgruntled Souta Takanashi. YouTuber ancasgirl95[1] uploaded a video titled "When I'm Bored" (shown below, left) on August 31, 2010, which featured several short clips and images of the character Yoko[2] from the Japanese anime series Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. Much of the source material was taken from the music video "Kirameki Yoko Box – Pieces of Sweet Stars", [3] accompanied by the Audiostalkers[4] remix of the song "Let Me Hit It" (shown below, right). The video remained somewhat unknown until October of 2011. Within two years of being uploaded, the video received over 9,900,000 views.  The first youtube video introducing Dic Soupcan was originally uploaded by metabug on Jan 19, 2010 called "Painis Cupcake meets Dic Soupcan" Dic Soupcan , the drunk that kills people to be alone and can gravitate. At point 0:46 you can hear Dic Soupcan introduce his self to Painis by saying "NO! , I am Dic Soupcan!"  On September 9th, 2009, YouTuber Young Dro uploaded "Sporty – o – Let Me Hit It ( Audiostalkers Original Mix) BEST QUALITY !!!" before the track was online and garnered over 11.7 million views in 11 years (shown below). Sporty-O then released the song to iTunes[1] in 2013.   The fashionable practice of wearing a men's button up shirt as a tube dress has been circulating on YouTube as early as in 2008, with the earliest known upload "Be Creative With: Men's Shirt"[1] dating back to November 10th, 2008. Dozens of similar "how-to" videos[2][3] were subsequently uploaded by other YouTubers from 2009 to 2011, which were picked up by fashion blogs across Tumblr and Blogspot. However, the most viewed instance on YouTube wasn't uploaded until August 25th, 2011, titled "How a Girl Should Put a Man's Shirt"[4]: The DIY-fashion tip was adapted into an ironic photo fad among male bloggers in early December 2011, when an image titled "How to wear men's shirts" was posted via 9gag[9], featuring a step-by-step instruction on how to wear a men's dress shirt as a tube dress.  The earliest archived use of >implying comments was posted to 4chan’s /v/ (video games) board on March 5th, 2009.[1] The thread began as a textual game of Pong (shown below, left) played via spoiler tags, with two capital "I" and lowercase os that show up only when the user hovers over them. In the thread, a user attempted to make spoiler volleyball game (show below, right), using (|) to represent the ball going over the net. Another user responded to the spoiler volleyball by saying “>implying that from a birds eye view you would be able to see the net through the ball when it passes over it.”    The song "Kill EVERYBODY" is from Skrillex's second EP Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites[1], which was released on October 22nd, 2010. The first Skrillex Tribute YTPMV was uploaded by YouTuber McMaNGOS[2] on December 9th, 2011. He remixed several different visual sources including clips from Community and Team Fortress 2, as well as added in different audio sources, with the song.   The single topic blog "Self Pop Tart" was launched by Kevin Patrick Hanley on November 22nd, 2011. Upon debuting on Tumblr, the blog received much attention after Pete Wentz, the bassist for the band Fall Out Boy, shared the link with his 2.8 million followers on Twitter.[3] Some of the most notable submissions on the official blog carry over 8,000 shares. The song "Crayons Could Melt On Us For All I Care" by Relient K was released with their album "Five Score and Seven Years Ago"[1] on the March 6, 2007 which included 14 songs on the CD, including this song which was track 11 and went for 0:12 seconds and only contained the following lyrics with a piano ballet in the background:   The original video named "Batman Eats a Hotdog" [1] was uploaded September 14th, 2011 by Rodrigo Huerta, a former Dreamworks animator under his channel user elcid1984 [2]. The video featured an animated version of the superhero Batman slowly raising a hotdog with mustard in his hand before quickly devouring it viciously. Following the complete consumption, Batman raises his head with mustard on his lips before swallowing, after which a bolt of lightning strikes in the background and the screen fades to black, with the only visible object being Batman's eyes before they fade out as well. The video used music from another YouTube video titled "Dramatic music 2" [3] uploaded by user Drullen1995 [4]. The video received over 150,000 views on its first day and has over 1.5 million views as of January 18th, 2012.      While it is unclear where the term selfie began, selfy spelled with a y was used as early as 2004 on photo-sharing site Flickr[23] to describe self-taken portraits. The term was also popular within the teenage population on the social networking site MySpace, as exhibited by the first definition for selfy, submitted to Urban Dictionary[24] on April 22nd, 2005.   The phrase "problem solved" has been used since as early as 2000[1] in computer and tech message boards in thread titles to denote that a solution has been found for the question posed. The phrase took on a more sarcastic tone as early as 2003, as shown in a thread from the Online Keyboard Community.[2] After the user Sol asked for suggestions on a keyboard that offers smooth transitions, Over The Edge solved his problem by telling him to both of his two ideal keyboards.  On September 12th, 2011, the earliest known example (shown left) was submitted to Reddit[1] which contained a photo of a cat standing on its hind legs while making a sad-looking expression with the caption "No wet food? / hafta eat the dry stuff." On November 14th, the "Cat World Problems" Tumblr[8] was created which featured image macros of a cat silhouette (shown middle) with anthropomorphic feline complaints. On January 11th, 2012, the first Quickmeme version of the series was submitted to the /r/AdviceAnimals[1] subreddit which included a photo of a young kitten with the caption "The clean laundry / isn't in the sunlight" (shown right). In two months the post received over 5,000 up votes.  Yonkoma Manga (or 4-koma for short, Japanese for "four-cell manga") is a comic-strip format, consisting of four panels, equally sized ordered vertically, from top to bottom. The first yonkoma comic was created by Japanese manga and nihonga artist[2] Rakuten Kitazawa (artist name, Yasuji Kitazawa) in 1902. The comic was called Jiji Manga[1].    The origin of Hoopla is from the 50th episode called Wet Painters/Krusty Krab Training Video in season 3 of the popular cartoon series Spongebob Squarepants by Nickelodeon.       The original photo originates from a series of stock photos titled "Young Boy Spending Time With Notebook" found on the stock photo sites Shutterstock[11], Dreamstrime[12] and Istockphoto.[13] A version without the watermark can be found in an article on Realwire[14] posted on October 30th, 2008. The first image macro was posted to the r/AdviceAnimals[1] subreddit on December 31, 2011 and contained the caption "1000000th visitor to this site / free iPad." A similar caption had been used in an earlier Lonely Computer Guy image macro. Comedy writer Justin Halpern launched the account on August 3th, 2009, soon after moving from Los Angeles back to his parents' house in San Diego. The painting used in the series is The Parable by American painter Lars Justinen[8] (shown below, left). The first instance of the image macro series was posted to the /r/AdviceAnimals subreddit[1] by iamhusband on February 1st, 2012. The captioned image (shown below, right) retells the biblical account of Matthew 14:22-33[2], which describes Jesus' miracle of walking on water, in a more modern fashion. The thread was positively received by the Reddit community, receiving 696 upvotes, 461 points overall and 16 comments before being archived. In less than a week, at least 40 additional instances were shared on Reddit[7] and more than 146 instances were submitted to Quickmeme.[3] But Jesus immediately said to them: “Take courage! It is I. Don’t be afraid.” “Lord, if it’s you,” Peter replied, “tell me to come to you on the water.” “Come,” he said. - Matthew 14:22-33   The photograph of Tom Brady sitting resignedly on the field was taken by AP photographer Paul Sancya shortly after the New York Giants' linebacker Chase Blackburn intercepted his pass during the fourth quarter of the Super Bowl game on February 5th, 2012. The pose was first coined "Bradying" on the entertainment portal site Boxden by user pabloescobarjr in a post titled "Bradying going to be the new Tebowing?"[1] on February 7th. The post showcased an image compilation of people imitating Brady's pose in an office along with the hashtag #Bradying.  The name Derpy was conceived by the fans on 4chan's "/co/":Jacob Batalon board on October 25th, 2010.[1] The original thread was submitted by Dr. Foreigner, who posted: "Go to 17:18 into the first episode and look at the ponies in the background. When you see it…" The iconic Derpy eyes can be observed at 1:15 in the following video:    On February 7th, 2012, an anonymous 4chan poster started a thread in which he requested pornographic images of the cartoon characters Arthur Read and Sue Ellen Armstrong from the children's cartoon Arthur. He went on to describe Sue Ellen, and another character from the show named Molly, in a very graphic and sexual manner. Most notably when giving these descriptions, he repeatedly used the phrase "the ass was fat". The following image shows the first post of the thread, along with several replies (click the image to enlarge): The post was met with disgust and ridicule from posters who believed that his request was legitimate, and laughter from other posters who believed that the thread was made as a joke. The phrase 'the ass was fat' was then repeated by other posters, and an image macro series was created in the same thread. The thread was also archived.    The phrase originated from a South Park episode titled “The Succubus” aired on April 21st, 1999. In the episode, the parents of the character Chef tell stories about encountering the Loch Ness Monster, who constantly begs the couple for $3.50. Chef's mom: Oh it was so scary! Chef's dad: And I yelled, I said "What do you want from us monster?!" And the monster bent down and said "I need about treefiddy." [silent pause] Kyle: What's treefiddy? Chef's dad: Three dollars and fifty cents. Chef's mom: Treefiddy.             A portmanteau of cat and the title of the film Inception, the term "Catception" has been previously used with other Inception-inspired viral media, including a video titled "Catception – The Original Dramatic Inception Cat" uploaded on July 19th, 2010 and a photograph of a cat bearing a fur pattern that resembles the silhouette of a cat. The original instance of a cat watching the Nyan Cat video[1] was uploaded by YouTuber alwayshungrycat on September 5th, 2011. The video has accrued more than 606,000 views as of August 2013.           The first aparition of Hassan in a YTMND was in "OJ gets Hassan'd"[2]. In this, O.J. Simpson and Pee-Wee Herman are interrumpted for the apparition of Muhammad Hassan and his theme. The story about The Creature emerged when a Image of a naked, pale human like creature running down a Dirt road in the night, along with the person's encounter, was posted on the /x/ board on 4chan, which was later added on the Creepypasta Wiki [2]. Both posts contain a sketch of the creature. Hey guys, normally creepy shit doesn’t happen to me, despite living in Weird NJ. I guess I can’t really say that anymore considering I’ve had the worst fucking week of my life. In a way, I brought all of this upon myself… but I’m getting ahead of myself. Since I’ve lurked /x/ for so long it’s only fair I tell you guys what happened. So a week ago it was my birthday, I just turned eighteen and I decided I wanted to fuck around and look for ghosts (I would’ve hung out with friends but I wasn’t in the mood to be a third wheel). If only I just sucked it up and dealt with it… Instead I shoved my phone and a flashlight in my hoodie pockets and snuck out my back door. I really didn’t expect to find much or I would’ve brought a proper weapon with me too, I guess it’s sort of dumb to think about it in retrospect. I remember glancing at the clock; it was around eleven or twelve at night when I left. It was pretty fuckin’ dark because there was a new moon and I figured if I was gonna see anything cool, it was now. Now, I wasn’t just walking around in the forest herp-a-derping. There’s actually a pretty sketchy cemetery about a ten minute walk from my house that’s been around for the past couple of hundred years. It’s also a spot that practices a “green burial”, where they put the body in a bio-degradable casket and send it on its way in the dirt. Well, my uncle owns the plot of land the cemetery is built on, and being the cheap bastard he is, most bodies buried there end up thrown in there by itself. I figured there must be some kind of ghost pissed off about having such a shitty resting place who roams around the cemetery at night and I guess I was thinking I could point him out to where my uncle lives, start a haunting, just for shits and giggles. It probably doesn’t work that way but I wasn’t expecting to find something anyway. I finally made my way there and I was about to go through the gate to the cemetery when I see some humanoid grey-colored…thing in the nature trail next to the cemetery (and yes, I shit you not, my uncle thought it was a great idea to put a nature trail next to the cemetery). I’m a little nervous at this point, because I can’t think of anybody other than me crazy enough to go to this place at night. There isn’t even a car around so whoever the fuck it was walked there just like I did. I shout out to this dude thinking maybe it’s some stoner smoking there or another ghost hunter. Well, they didn’t say anything; all I could hear was this sickly sound of wheezing. I thought maybe they needed help and were out of breath from running away from something so I take a deep breath and start walking down the trail. I whipped out my flashlight to light up whoever’s down there only to stop dead in my tracks: whatever the fuck this thing was, it had no arms and no clothes on. Basically I NOPEd the fuck out of there, ran the whole way home and locked every door in my house. My mom was pretty pissed off that I snuck out and figured I was on a bad trip when I told her about the naked no-armed thing stalking by the cemetery. I wouldn’t blame her but I wished she would’ve believed me or at least humored me so I could carry around one of the Rambo knives she collects. I was still pretty shaken up; this freak of nature had to know where I lived because I don’t run that fast. I rationalized it with myself, I didn’t see the fucker behind me and I didn’t hear that horrible wheezing sound so I decided I shouldn’t worry about nothing and a couple days later I was sleeping regularly again. Until I saw it again. My front door was open so my dog could go in and out as she pleased. Her name is Piggy, and she’s an inside dog but house-trained so she will go outside when she needs to use the bathroom. Dogs always have a place they always like to shit, and her spot was smack-dab in the middle of the field in front of my house. Piggy ran outside and a minute or so later I heard her barking. I’m a little confused because she normally never barks so I figure there must be a stray cat around or something, so I get up to see the situation. That damned thing was standing in the middle of the field, fixated on my dog. He had a toothy, shit-eating grin on his face and the little teeth he had in his mouth looked as if they were about to rot out. He was completely hairless and grey all over, with eyes chinked out more than Kim Jong Il. I start screaming, making any kind of noise necessary to distract him from eating my beloved Piggy (who during all of this is frozen in her tracks) and his eyes dart up to meet mine. We have this staring contest for what seems like hours, but I’m sure was only a few minutes. He broke my gaze and…I shit you not, began peeing on my dog. His pee was not yellow, but a disgusting pea green, that coated my dogs fur and was viscous like snot. It had this horrid acidic smell, similar to that of sulfur. I have no clue what the fuck it was, but it was on my dog and it couldn’t have been a good thing. At this point I grabbed a kitchen knife and started running towards the fucker when he stops pissing and wheezes away. I would’ve pursued him but I was just thankful he didn’t eat my dog, but peeing on her wasn’t the greatest alternative. I put on some rubber gloves and grab some lilac doggie shampoo to hose her down. Piggy normally doesn’t like baths but I’m sure she was happy to get that shit off of her. I went to bed a few hours later, but not before locking all the doors. I was not taking anymore chances with this fuck. I didn’t know what to do about him that night so I decided to sleep on it. Now, normally Piggy sleeps with me, but that night I never felt her climb next to me and the one time I woke up, it seemed as if she was staring in the distance. I woke up and my mom was crying, telling me there was something wrong with Piggy. She was wheezing and I instantly remembered that no-armed motherfucker pissing on her the other day. But I shook it from my memory pretty quick to tend for my dog. I remember she had this sad look in her eyes, and she wouldn’t drink any water or even eat meat. I was scared shitless and sped to the vet, who referred me to the hospital, who had her stay overnight. Apparently, she had contracted doggie pneumonia in the middle of the summer. About $1,100 in vet bills later, Piggy drove home with me the next day in a horrible thunderstorm. I pull up to my driveway and what do you know? That bastard is standing right in the middle of it. He was staring at me like a deer caught in the headlights, and I knew this was my chance. I wasn’t going to be fucking around. I floored my car right at him and I saw his eyes widen to a full fucking circle. Next thing I knew, he jumped up on my car, then off again and full-out sprinted off into the fucking woods. I missed him. The one shot I had to kill him, I missed him. The past couple days I haven’t really slept, all I can think about is this fucking creature. I’ve never heard of something like this before, and he doesn’t seem as dumb as I thought he was. I know he’s planning his next move and I’m scared shitless as to what this fuck could do to me or my family… I really don’t know what to do, /x/. I’ve gotten only 10 hours of sleep this whole week and I know I’m not going to be able to keep it up soon. I’m scared to close my eyes… scared that as soon as I do, he’ll be back, but in my room, doing God knows what. Does anyone have any experience with a creature like this? I can’t stay awake forever.     The comedy film Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas[1], adapted from a 1971 novel of the same name by Hunter S. Thompson, was released on May 22nd, 1998. The movie was directed by Terry Gilliam and starred Johnny Depp as the protagonist Raoul Duke and Benicio del Toro as his lawyer Dr. Gonzo. In one scene (shown below), Duke and Gonzo are driving down a desert road when Gonzo suddenly pulls the car over. Duke responds by proclaiming "we can't stop here, this is bat country." It is suggested that the bats are a product of Duke's imagination brought on by hallucinogenic drugs. Several months after Hunter S. Thompson's death on February 20th, 2005, the YTMND[9] site "We can't stop here! This is bat country!" was created on May 16th. It featured a photoshopped image of two cats in a car with background audio from the original scene in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.  Headlight Fluid was invented during a prank call made by Detroit’s Channel 955 radio DJ Spike[2] which was originally featured as a segment on the AM radio show Mojo in the Morning and subsequently released on a compilation CD in May 2001.[3][4] Titled “Clueless Auto Repair,” the call consisted of a person posing as a mechanic advising a woman on the state of her automobile repairs. In addition to telling her she needs to replace her "headlight fluid," a non-existent item, the man goes on to explain that her left tires and right tires somehow had switched sides and her transmission had been removed and she needed to replace it with two new ones. As early as August 2nd, 2002, an MP3 version of the call, now titled “The Mechanic,” was uploaded to eBaum’s World[1] and made available to download.  Sinnlos im Weltraum is a parody web series of Star Trek.    The phrase was first used in the title of the video Frauentausch – Psychopath Andreas rastet total aus (Andreas hitler) uploaded on the April 16th, 2011. When the Hitler video appeared in this video, the idea of making dubs has been awacked. So BrotKrusteTV uploaded on the May 11th, 2011 his first dubbing version video by adding the audio of Andreas Höber and putting it in the Sneezing Baby Panda clip and another unknown clip. He also made a part of the video by removing the audio of the episode and putting an audio from the film Der Untergang in 2004. And also he used the phrase for his videos' title.  In 2002 the german online global internet service AOL engaged news reader Dagmar Berghoff to make the pop up voice when AOL users get e-mails. The sentence she said was Sie haben Post .  Rhythm Heaven Fever was fisrt relased to Japanese Wii console on July 21st, 2011. Soon after this, many playing videos of its minigames started to be posted by users to both YouTube and Nico Nico Douga (NND). Among those videos, "Ringside" which is one of the minigames involving a wrestler being interviewed, where the player must nod their head in agreement, flex their muscles, or pose for the fans got the best attention because of its macho and ridiculous rendition. It originally comes from the show Family guy from the special of "Family Guy Presents Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story" including a scene with a sober Brian and a drunk Stewie arguing about Stewie's drinking problem    On January 24th, 2009, NND[1] user Zeno (是乃) uploaded the first instance which featured Reimu Hakurei, the main character from the Touhou Project series, performing an energetic dance to the track “Night of Nights.”Its complete version[2] uploaded on March 17, 2009 received over 330,000 views and a YouTube version accumulated over 155,000 views in less than three years.     The term "I Eat Your X" is originally from the achievement of Scout of where you must kill a heavy while eating his Sandvich and take the Sandvich when he dies. When the achievement is unlocked the sound file "I Eat Your Sandwiches!" plays in the background.   The first instance of this song is "Avelife Pony" featuring My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. It was uploaded on July 6, 2011.  On July 20th, 2008, FARK[2] user Control_this commented in a thread about the state of casinos in Illinois with a photograph of a young woman playing a slot machine followed by a photo of an older woman smoking while playing another gambling machine.  Though the phrase is relatively common, one of the earliest notable examples of its use appeared in the 1994 film Pulp Fiction. After Vincent (played by John Travolta) accidentally shoots their informant Marvin (played by Phil LaMarr) point blank in the face, his partner Jules (played by Samuel L. Jackson) comments that he had seen "some crazy ass shit in [his] time," but it did not compare to what had just happened. In 2002, Californian interaction designer Jim Gasperini[13] uploaded eight experimental GIFs[14] that combined right and left images from stereographs he had previously taken, describing them as "wiggling scenes."[31] Titled "Time for Space Wiggle," the page was shared on Metafilter[15] on July 31st, 2003 and BoingBoing[33] on November 1st. The next month, Gasperini published an instructional blog post[16] for the Oakland Camera Club, in which he stated that he was overwhelmed with people's response to his GIFs. The word "wigglegram" was coined by British photographer Brian Harte[32] in one of his blog posts in 2007.  On March 7, 2012, Tara Strong[2], voice actress of Twilight Sparkle, posted a tweet[6] acting as Twilight performing a short free-style rap, which included the phrase "Twilightlicious", similar to Fergie's[4] "Fergalicious". Two days later, she posted a "VocalTwit"[3] of herself acting as Twilight again, singing the lyrics from the previous tweet[7], as well as singing versions for some of her other past acting roles such as Raven of Teen Titans[8], Bubbles of The Powerpuff Girls[9], and Omi of Xiaolin Showdown[10].       The first instance of the meme appeared on Reddit posted by User "iloveragedump.   The saying originally came from the episode of show, "Futurama" [1] "Love and Rocket" [2] where the character, "Bender" uses the term to make fun of Leela.         The earliest comic with this rage face can be found in the spaniard rage comic's page Cuánto Cabrón [3], in a comic called "Evoluciones de un Pikachu" [4], where a girl ask how to evolve a Pikachu, and the boy ask that she need a Thunderstone. The term was first used with the movies portrayed with Rob Schneider's movie trailer's. These were used within the advertisement of the movies and were not used in any comedy parody perspective in any way. The exact origin of the phrase remains unknown. On October 31st, 2007, a video message titled "Checkmate, Atheists" was uploaded by YouTuber[1] comedian and musician Edward Current. In the video, Current presents ten points to prove the existence of a Christian God, proclaiming "Checkmate!" after each one. While Current is a self-identified atheist and his video was intended as a satire, it managed to stir a lengthy debate about the validity of his claims in the comments. As of October 2012, the video has received more than 1.2 million views and over 55,000 comments. In the 31st episode of the 5th Season of the Pokemon Anime, Ash and his friends come across a Pokemon magician. They help her with finding the ingredients for a spell that will help with reading a Pokemon's mind. At the end of the episode, Ash volunteers to try out the spell, but it doesn't end up working as planned as Ash gets transformed into a Pikachu. Despite this, Brock notes that Ash has actually entered the mind of a Pokemon so he says the spell actually worked. Ash changed back in the following episode, and brought hopes to fans that something like this might happen again. People confirm, that the since 2010 SuSpended YouTube Pooper KroboProductions created the first SuS in his video Captain Rescue gets a Slim Pack of Double Mint Gum. The video down below is a re-uploaded video uploaded by KroboMemorial. KroboProductions now still exists on YouTube as Dikekike.   "LOLLIES" was an idea that was posted on the "I Can Has Cheezburger" website on the 9th of April 2012. This may not be viral first hand, but may become popular in the later days.  The main reason for the confusion between Link and Zelda is the inclusion of the name "Zelda" in the title of the series despite the playable character being Link, a male, leading those who know little about the series to assume Zelda is the one portrayed as the protagonist. The character Samus Aran from the Metroid series of games is also frequently confused as a male and called "Metroid" due to the title, as well as the armor Samus wears. Search interest for "what if Zelda was a girl" began to rise in 2010. On May 22nd, 2010, an anonymous user of 4chan's /tg/[1] board posted, "what if Zelda was a girl?" along with a gender-swapped version of Link, offering one of the earliest known posts using the phrase to troll (shown below). Users continued to post the phrase across 4chan over the course of the year, usually alongside gender-swapped images of Link, fishing for confused or angry reactions from users genuinely thinking they don't know Zelda is a girl (examples shown below). On the morning of April 7th, 2012, a three-alarm fire broke out at an Oklahoma City apartment complex in Oklahoma, leaving one person hospitalized for smoke inhalation and five units damaged.[2] The local station KFOR News Channel 4[1] was among the first to arrive on the scene and interview one of the displaced residents Sweet Brown. During the interview, she stated that she had woken up to get a “cold pop” when she thought someone was grilling before she realized there was a fire. Brown then proceeded to run out of the apartment without shoes. In describing the heavy presence of smoke from the fire, she uttered “ain’t nobody got time for that!” which became one of the more memorable lines. The clip was first uploaded to YouTube[4] by KFOR employee Ted Malave on the same day, however, another version uploaded by YouTuber lucasmarr[5] on April 9th became the most shared version to date, gaining over 1 million views and over 109,000 Facebook shares[6] within 48 hours.      The comic came from the internet comics of Hark! A Vagrant under the title Tycho, Hatshepsut, Anne of Cleves (http://beatonna.livejournal.com/79859.html)   As with most folklores, the origin of the Bloody Mary story is lost in time. It is implicated that its origin lies in a ritual that young women had to do at the British islands in the 1700's, the ritual involved using a candle in front of a mirror wherein she would see her future husband. In modern times however, the ritual is just a form of entertainment among children.[1] While there are many different stories about who Bloody Mary really is, many point to a woman named Mary Worth, who was horribly disfigured in a car crash. Some indicate that it's Queen Mary I of England or Elizabeth Bathory. Others tell of a witch who was burned at the stake and has returned for revenge.[2]      The image macro's exact origins are unknown, but it came into high use on 4chan sometime in early 2011. The most often used image is an image of the Scout from the videogame Team Fortress 2. The documented use of the image was on an early PonyChan[1] thread on March 18th, 2011.  On April 14th, 2012, The Orange County Register[4] published an article about the first day of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, which included photographer Kevin Sullivan's photo of Alex Turner jumping in mid-air while playing his guitar. On April 16th, Tumblr user eatsleepstrokesrepeat[3] posted four exploitables[6] using the photograph, including pictures of Turner next to Ridiculously Photogenic Guy (top left), running on a track (top right), jumping over a double rainbow (bottom left) and jumping in a promotional photo for the television film franchise High School Musical (bottom right). Within one week, the post received over 1,800 notes.   The original Yu-Gi-Oh manga (Yu-Gi-Oh roughly translating to "King Of Games") was released in 1996 and finished in 2004. It follows the story of Yugi as he adventures with his friends and uses games designed by Pegasus to fight various villains The episode "The Desert" was first aired on Nickelodeon on July 14, 2006. In this episode, the main characters are lost in the desert "Si Wong" to find Appa, the flying Bison, but they ended up with extreme thirst. Later, Sokka noticed a cactus on the desert and drunk the juice of it. After he drunk some of the juice, he goes on a strange trip and offers his friends to drink it, too.  Queen's "Bohemian Rhapsody" was released in the United Kingdom on October 31st, 1975 as the first single from their album A Night At the Opera. The single stayed at the top of the U.K. singles charts for nine weeks and sold more than a million copies in less than four months.[1] In November 1975, the band shot a promotional video for the song, which some consider one of the first proper music videos (shown below).   On December 23rd, 2010, photographer Drew Angerer[9] published a blog post titled "Obama and the Lame Duck Congress"[2], which featured a photo of President Obama and former President Clinton making a surprise joint appearance in the White House briefing room to discuss a tax bill compromise (shown left). On April 16th, 2012, Redditor MadLarkin submitted the photograph to the /r/pics[1] subreddit in a post titled "Words can not describe how much I love this pic of Obama and Clinton." In the post, Redditor bastian1343 posted an image macro of the photo with the caption "Whose unemployment rates do you have to lower to get blown around here?" (shown right).  Earliest known use was in April 23rd, 2012 on Memebase.   Annually, HfBoards hosts a photoshop thread for the NHL Playoffs. Their work has caught the attention of a number of websites [1] [2] The original picture can be found on page 19, post #468 in the 2012 Playoff Photoshop Thread (Part I) by user Little bunny Foo Foo [1]. The first Photoshop, albeit a sloppy one was posted by user elproducto 2 posts later [2].      The Hey Girl, It's Paul Ryan Tumblr[1] was inspired by an article posted on the political blog NakedDC[6] by conservative political consultant Emily Zanotti on April 30th, 2012 . After reading a story about Republican congressman Paul Ryan[2] catching fish with his bare hands[7], Zanotti envisioned him as a Ryan Gosling-esque figure for the Republican party and created several image macros starting with the phrase "Hey girl." The combination of politicians' quotes and Ryan Gosling's "Hey Girl" trope had been seen before with the Twitter hashtag #PaulRyanGosling[18] as well as the single topic blog Ron Paul Ryan Gosling, which were both launched in February of 2012. That same month, the Washington Post[17] published a compilation of Ryan Gosling image macros based on #PaulRyanGosling tweets. On May 1st, 2012, French president Nicolas Sarkozy appeared at a public gathering with his supporters for the presidential elections and the International Workers' Day at Trocadero, a famous square located right in front of the Eiffel Tower in Paris. As part of his entrance, Sarkozy did an awkward pose, opening his arms to the public with a funny face. One picture of this moment was captured by photographer Philippe Wojazer, from the Agence France Presse: The next day on May 2nd, the Trollcadero[1] Tumblr (contraction of Troll and Trocadero), was launched, curating dozens of parodies while providing both the original image and an exploitable version for visitors to use. As of May 5th, the blog accumulated over 100 parodies.  The first fluffy pony was created by DeviantArt[1] user Mixermike622 on January 3rd, 2012, under the title "FLUFFLE PUFF," which received over 154,000 views and 5,000 favorites in nine years (seen below).      On May 5th, 2012, a user on 4chan's /b/ (random) board posted a thread[7] urging board members to send reports of a "new drug craze" to respectable news websites involving teenagers rubbing toothpaste on their nipples to induce a full-body high. In the thread, users posted screenshots of messages left on anonymous chat site Omegle as well as messages that were apparently sent to local Fox affiliate news stations. Many users linked to a PubMed abstract[15] stating that titanium dioxide nanoparticles, which can be found in toothpastes, may have harmed spatial recognition memory in the mice they tested. However, similar practices have been observed prior to the coinage of the term "toothpasting." On March 11th, 2010, a user on the Body Building Forums[4] started a thread titled "Ask a guy who just put toothpaste on his nipples anything," but the thread did not recieve any responses until May 26th, 2011. The original poster stated that he did it to combat "gyno,"[5] short for Gynecomastia[6], or the abnormal growth of breast tissue in males. This reasoning appeared a second time on the board[14] on April 6th, 2012. Putting toothpaste on one's nipples saw a resurgence on question and answer sites, appearing on Yahoo! Answers in March 2011[3] and July 2011[1], and Blurt It![2] also in July. In the latter two posts, users asserted that it was a method to encourage breast tissue growth.    On May 6, 2012, tumblr user beekkake posted the original image onto their blog. [1] The purpose of the post was parody, but was quickly misinterpreted and the beekkake was criticized.   The song on and on is written by the Japanese composer Satoru Kōsaki[2] who also writes many songs for animes and video games such as The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, THE iDOLM@STER and Motteke! Sailor Fuku in Lucky Star. The video that led to a substantial increase in popularity of the series was "Don't call me KokorokokoroKOKOROkokoROKOkoroKOKOrokoKOROkokoKokoro-chan" (Japanese: 小衣こころココロここロコころココろこコロここ小衣ちゃん言うな, KokorokokoroKOKOROkokoROKOkoroKOKOrokoKOROkokoKokoro-chan iu na)[3], posted to NND by a user chas[4] on January 5th, 2012. Those characters featured in this video are from the Japanese TV anime series Tantei Opera Milky Holmes.[5] This TVCMs for Subaru's "100,000 Yen cash back" campaign was aired from February to March in 2011. And its plot is that a wife talks how her husband and her elder brother are suprised at the campaign to her friends. "Heee-Haaah!" and "That's just wrong!" are not mere catch phrases only in these adverts, but their signature gags and are heard in many TV shows since before. In addition, it's a famous episode among their fans that Kosugi's "Heee-Haaah!" was born by getting inspiration from Michael Jackson's 1983 song "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'". The anime adaptation of Manta Aisora's Haiyore! Nyaruko-san was produced by Xebec, where it follows Nyaruko, a Cthulhu-deity of chaos called Nyarlathotep who takes a form of a young girl in order to protect a high school boy named Mahiro Yasaka from creatures within H.P. Lovecraft tales. A promotional trailer for the show was uploaded to Niconico[3] on March 23rd, 2012, where it featured its theme song "Taiyou Iwaku Moeyo Chaos" (太陽曰く燃えよカオス, The Sun Says "Burn, Chaos"), with it being sung by the show's voice actress Kana Asumi, Miyu Matsuki and Yuka Otsubo. Spoilers for Avatar: The Legend of Korra The stills of Amon originate from Book One: Air, episode 3: "The Revelation" of Avatar: The Legend of Korra. In the episode, the protagonists Korra and Mako infiltrate an underground event hosted by the series antagonist, Amon and his group of equalists.The main event of Amon demostrating his ability to remove the bending powers of benders is preceded by a speech by Amon who speaks about his motivations for founding the equalists due to the death of his parents at the hands of a bender and blaming benders for every major conflict. In 2011, some of the earliest instances of these images began appearing on 4chan, particularly on /b/ (random) and /wg/ (wallpaper general) boards. They were very well-received, but remained nameless.  The sound file was uploaded by Mantlegen on 11 Jan 2012 Gotye released the track "Somebody That I Used to Know" as the lead single for his third studio album Making Mirrors on July 5th, 2011. The same day, the official music video was uploaded to YouTube, which featured Gotye and Kimbra covered in body paint to blend in with a painted backdrop. Within 11 months, the video accumulated over 213 million views and 250,000 comments, which saw a dramatic increase in January of 2012 after a five-hands guitar cover was released by the band Walk off the Earth. In an interview with Rolling Stone Australia[10], Gotye revealed that the song's lyrics described different perspectives at the end of a breakup, which he based off previous relationships. [Gotye:] Now and then I think of when we were together Like when you said you felt so happy you could die Told myself that you were right for me But felt so lonely in your company But that was love and it's an ache I still remember You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness Like resignation to the end, always the end So when we found that we could not make sense Well you said that we would still be friends But I'll admit that I was glad it was over But you didn't have to cut me off Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing And I don't even need your love But you treat me like a stranger and I feel so rough No you didn't have to stoop so low Have your friends collect your records and then change your number I guess that I don't need that though Now you're just somebody that I used to know Now you're just somebody that I used to know Now you're just somebody that I used to know [Kimbra:] Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over Part of me believing it was always something that I'd done But I don't wanna live that way Reading into every word you say You said that you could let it go And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know [Gotye:] But you didn't have to cut me off Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing And I don't even need your love But you treat me like a stranger and I feel so rough And you didn't have to stoop so low Have your friends collect your records and then change your number I guess that I don't need that though Now you're just somebody that I used to know [x2] Somebody (I used to know) Somebody (Now you're just somebody that I used to know) (I used to know) (That I used to know) (I used to know) Somebody    The line comes from the pornographic manga Taking Shelter from the Rain by hentai and lolicon mangaka Boku, first released in 2008. An English translation of the manga was further made and spread across the western web, revealing a funny way of expressing male orgasm: This unusual line caused its sensation as early as February 2009 on the 4chan's /a/ board[1]. Through out the rest of 2009 and onward, the catchphrase became a recurring theme on 4chan, especially when someone's got the I came reaction towards a picture[2].  One of the earliest instances of the phrase "Oh, You" being used in this manner may have been the 1920 novel Oh, You Tex![5] by American novelist William MacLeod Raine.[6] In the Western romance novel, the main character, Tex works his way up from being looked down upon within the cowboy community to marrying the boss' daughter. As Tex leaves for his honeymoon, a friend shouts, "Oh, you," as he rides off, remarking at his climb up the social ladder. The phrase has been paired with an image of a man condescendingly looking down at something with his hands on his hips. Though the origin of this photo is unclear, it has been used on message boards since February 2006[2], when Newgrounds user Wtflrish posted it in response to site moderator Gooch's story about running over a tumbleweed with his car. Another image associated with the phrase is a derivative of a NO U photo that was popular on the Something Awful message boards.  The game was released on Febraury 15, 2008 with the digital game distribution platform "Steam" by Valve    The scene comes form the episode Supper Villain from Season 2 of the PowerPuff Girls which was first shown in 1999 The character was introduced in a promotional video for Nintendo's Mii Universe, a new user-interface that would've become available on the Wii U system, screened as part of the Nintendo Direct live broadcast[2] event on June 3rd, 2012. The trailer begins with a video gamer playing a zombie game and attempting to use the Mii Universe for tips on how to beat the boss he is stuck with. Throughout the clip, the gamer talks to a blue, yellow, and red action figure he calls "Non-Specific Action Figure." Later that day, the video was uploaded to YouTube on a handful of different channels, including Nintendo World Report[3] and IGN[4] in addition to individual user uploads. The Circus Afro scene first appeared in the official trailer for Madagascar 3, which began to appear on YouTube[2] in early December of 2011. The scene in question features character Marty the Zebra, voiced by actor/comedian Chris Rock, in a polka-dot suit and rainbow-colored wig dancing around while singing the popular circus tune Entry of the Gladiators. The clip was followed by well-known house song “I Like to Move It” by Reel 2 Real featuring The Mad Stuntman. A video with just this Circus Afro scene was uploaded to YouTube on December 9th, 2011, which has more than 863,000 views as of June 2012.         On April 26th, 1999, a member of the Usenet group alt.usage.english[3] G. Bryan Lord (a.k.a. Skitt) coined the term in a thread discussing the nuances of using the titles "Ms. and "Miss." When user Perchprism replied remarking that the group's rules may make some users to be overly self-conscious, Skitt replied with the definition of "Skitt's Law": "You've entered my vocabulary: Skitt's Law, a corollary of Murphy's Law, variously expressed as "any post correcting an error in another post will contain at least one error itself" or "the likelihood of an error in a post is directly proportional to the embarrassment it will cause the poster." The effect is, of course, magnified a hundredfold if the post is in reply to Skitt himself."  The exploitable panels come from a comic published on the Livejournal webcomic blog Hiimdaisy[2] on April 6th, 2009. The comic mocks the unoriginality of the boss characters' names “Boss” and “Big Boss" featured in the video game Metal Gear Solid. On April 2007, a Flash animation by IOSYS satirized their annoying tendency to pop up at inopportune times during play and respawn every three days after being defeated. It turned them into a popular meme within Japanese image-board culture. IOSYS depicts the FOE as a literal monster rather than a placeholder: tribble-like orange fuzzballs with the °д° emoticon for a face. This has become the standard way of drawing them, although the nature of black and white doujinshi means white is a common alternate color.  Martha began her blog on April 30th, 2012[2], outlining the criteria that she would be reviewing the meals with: A taste rating, how many mouthfuls it took to complete, the type of course offered, a health rating, the price and jokingly, pieces of hair. She signed the post VEG, which is an initialism for the Latin phrase Veritas Ex Gustu meaning "truth from tasting." Martha's first photos were uploaded on May 8th[3], showing two lunches she had eaten. Her first lunch photo consisted of a slice of pizza, a muffin, one croquette and a small amount of corn, while the second photo featured a cheeseburger, two croquettes, three slices of cucumber and an ice pop. The post went on to generate nearly 90 comments from the readers, many of whom addressed their concerns over the inadequacies of the school lunch menu.   On December 10th, 2011, Sweden's cultural and tourism outreach agencies Swedish Institute and VisitSweden unveiled a social media campaign called "Curators of Sweden," which invites a new Swedish citizen every week to manage the Scandinavian country's official Twitter account @Sweden. The first Swedish national to take the wheel behind @Sweden was Jack Wermer, a writer and marketer, who ran the Twitter account from December 10th to December 18th, 2011. As of October 2012, more than 44 curators have participated in the project, revealing a truly multi-facetted and unfiltered image of Sweden. The concept of single topic blogging has existed in various forms for decades, beginning with Usenet newsgroups and niche interest BBS communities in the early 1990s. Following the arrival of CMS publishing platforms like LiveJournal, Blogger in the late 1990s and Wordpress in 2003, it became a common trend to blog about one particular subject rather than many. In early 2000s, numerous photo blogs focusing on media curation bound by a single theme began to emerge, such as the French photo fad website À Plat Ventre" and the photo-a-day blog Project 365 in 2004 and the contagious media website Crying While Eating in 2005. The format took a leap forward in the late 2000s with the rise of shortform or microblogging platforms like Tumblr and Twitter, which gave way to some of the first single topic blogs like F**k My Life in January 2008, as well as Look At This Fucking Hipster[10] in March 2009.    One of the earliest age tests was submitted to FunnyJunk[3] on May 2nd, 2011, parodying the age verification that pops up when visiting the online gaming community MyCrysis.[4] In the image, the number input field was replaced with a photograph of a VHS casette tape, an early format of video recording media that became widespread in the 1980s and later superseded by DVDs in the 2000s.[5]      The image of the laughing man (shown below, left)was submitted to the /r/Funny subreddit[1] on June 1st, 2012 in a thread titled "My dad recently discovered memes. He's 38 and he's laughing so hard that he's crying." The thread hit the front page, gaining more than 16,600 upotes, 1,700 points overall and 1,300 comments prior to being archived. The same day, Redditor hiddenxninja2 submitted an image macro version of the photo titled "New Meme Dad" (shown below, right) to the Advice Animals subreddit[11] the same day, adding a caption depicting the man's perceived response to Socially Awkward Penguin. The post only received 7 upvotes and 2 points overall.   One of the earliest archived uses of "grammar nazi" appeared on the newsgroup alt.gothic[1] on January 19th, 1995. The post was made by Marc Savlov, who used the phrase to call out poster Charles Burns for correcting someone else's use of the word "thusly," as "thus" is already an adverb and does not need the "-ly" suffix. The post generated eight replies of mixed opinions, with some making fun of the original poster and others commending his dedication to proper language. "I'm so happy" was written by a Japanese composer Ryu[2] who has also produced other popular audio tracks for online parody videos: Second Heaven, Ageha, Sakura Reflection and Bloomin' Feeling. It was first included as a secret track in jubeat knit released on the Japanese arcade on July 29th, 2010. This song began being introduced to MADs in the 7th music video game MAD event which was one of the small user-generated online events for MADs and held in August in that year.[3] Several MAD videos of this fresh tune, featuring Shuzo Matsuoka or K-ON!, scored much page views among in 90 entries.[4]    The original image is captured from a scene in the South Park episode "Margaritaville"[1], which first aired on March 25th, 2009. The phrase is used by a teller at South Park Bank Savings and Loans while informing customers that their money has been lost. On April 22nd, 2012, the first "And it's gone!" image macro was uploaded to Quickmeme[2] with the caption “You post your new meme idea. You think it's going to do great / Aaaand it's gone" (shown below). Pokémon Ruby and Pokémon Sapphire were released in November 2002 in Japan and throughout 2003 for the rest of the world, marking the launch of the third generation of Pokémon video games. The belief that there would be remakes of these games stems from the fact that there had been remakes of the Pokemon generations prior to Ruby and Sapphire. Because the remakes of Generation I were released during the Generation III, and Generation II during the Generation IV games, many fans believed that Generation III would be revived during Generation V. This lead to certain fans looking for details in the Generation V titles that would hint at a remake of the Generation III games. Amidst intense speculations on Pokémon fan forums, "Hoenn confirmed" became a tongue-in-cheek way of mocking these believers.  The Internet's photoshop tribute to Mussum began in early October 2009, shortly after the International Olympic Committee's announcement of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, as host of the upcoming 2016 Olympic Games. To celebrate the achievement, Brazilian illustrator Rodrigo Hashimoto tweeted a lampoon version of Barack Obama's "Hope" campaign poster featuring the face of Mussum and the caption: "Yes We Créu" (shown below). However, illustrations and artworks inspired by Mussum had been circulating for months prior to Rodrigo Hashimoto's tweet. In June 2009, a social media campaign titled "Mussum Forevis" was launched across Brazil's humor blogs, Twitter and Facebook in remembrance of the 15th anniversary of Mussum's death.  The clip was originally recorded during a second-round match of Guilty Gear XX between Japanese pro-gamers Daigo "The Beast" Umehara (SOL)[1] vs. an unknown player Shishamo (Faust) at the the 1st Arcadia Cup Tournament[2] held on March 22nd and 23rd, 2003. Due to Umehara's legendary reputation in Japanese video game competitions, the footage was included in the official DVD titled "TOUGEKI SUPER BATTLE DVD TRILOGY-DISC3," which was released on June 26th of that same year.[3] Transcript:    One of the earliest documented instances of the test has been attributed to The Unisex Purity Test, written in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Baker House sometime before 1980. The first incarnation had two parallel versions, 100 questions each; one for male, and one for female.  YouTube user MrBozSweetwater uploaded a recording of the Rattle Me Bones advertisement on 25th Dec, 2010: On the same day, a Spanish version of the same advertisement has been attested under another user MsDamianDD: On Oct 17, 2013, MrBozSweetwater later went on the post the commercial for the French version, Captain Carcasse:  It's origin is uncertain. One of its first publications was on july 3, 2011 in a blog called "MecagodeRiZa" and "Trollface-Problemweb" but they became more popular in 2012 on Facebook and MemeChef.    The original bear photo (shown below, left) was taken by photojournalist Clemens Bilan and was submitted to the stock photo website Getty Images[14] on April 12th, 2007. Several years later on June 21st, 2012, Redditor F-18Bro submitted a post titled "I have a lot of weird stuff that I'd like to b able to confess to reddit so i can get it off my chest, so I made Confession Bear"[1], which included another image macro of the bear with the caption "I absolutely love / the smell of my own balls" (shown below, right). Within four days, the post received over 13,000 up votes and 1,100 comments. On July 11th, 2012, the Matt Romney Facebook[1] page was created, featuring posts written from the perspective of a fictional politician. Later that month, a Twitter feed for the character was created.[4] Over the next four years, the Facebook page gained over 32,200 likes and the Twitter account received more than 6,800 followers.    Artistic photographs paired with profound quotes or poem verses have been circulating online since the early 2000s, most notably through personal blogging platforms and artist communities and like LiveJournal, MySpace and DeviantArt.[12] Several digital photography projects launched during the era also contributed to the early development of the genre, such as Frank Warren's single topic blog Post Secret which curates anonymously submitted confessions written on handmade post cards or Tony Deifell's collaborative blog project Why Do You Do What You Do?.  The original Beaton comic was uploaded to her website Hark a Vagrant![11] (shown below, left). While it is unclear when exactly Beaton posted the comic, it was posted sometime prior to November 4th, 2010, as a definition for "Yiss" appeared on Urban Dictionary that day.[2] Beaton redrew the comic in "Gorey Covers Part 5" (shown below, right).[12] TThe original screen capture was taken from the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode “Ménage à Troi” originally aired on May 28th, 1990, in which Captain Picard recites lines from the sonnets by the English poet and playwright William Shakespeare. Prior to the arrival of Annoyed Picard, the Star Trek character has long been associated with reaction face images conveying irritability or disappointment, most notably through the Facepalm instance from 2005 and the original instance of "WTF is this shit" based on the same screen capture. The Quickmeme[1] page for “Annoyed Picard” was created on January 23rd, 2012, which featured the screen capture of Picard with an outstretched arm accompanied by the caption “Oh come on! / You don’t even know what a meme is!”    On August 9, 2012, Buzzfeed posted several behind-the-scenes photos from the recording of the new season of "Arrested Development". [1] One of these photos was of actor David Cross in a peculiar outfit.    The pig named Plopper first appeared in a trailer from the successful 2007 film "The Simpsons Movie" before internationally airing it in cinemas on July 26, 2007. It's first appearence was in the fictional fast food restaurant Krusty Burger, when Krusty, the clown, featured the pig in a TV commercial for his new burger named The Clogger and decided to kill it after completing the commercial. Homer became upset and immediately adopted him but later spends more time with the pig than with his son Bart. Plopper is voiced by the voice actress "Tress MacNeille", who also voiced for characters such as Linda, Mom and Hattie McDoogal from another popular animated TV series Futurama .  On August 13th, 2012, President Obama gave a speech at Bayliss Park in Council Bluffs, Iowa, as part of his three day re-election campaign bus tour through the state. During his speech, Associated Press[1] photographer Carolyn Kaster captured a striking image of the president making a hand gesture in front of a glaring stage light. From the particular angle of Kaster's shot, the president appeared as if he was holding a ball of fire in his hand. The humorous comparison of Kaster's image to wizardry was first made by New York Magazine[2] writer Dan Amira in an article titled "Presdent Obama is a Wizard" posted on the following day of August 14th. The character Mr. Chad seen in the doodle (shown below) is rumored to have been originally illustrated by British cartoonist George Chatterton in 1938, according to the author Michael Quinion on his site World Wide Words.[6] The earliest known use of the doodle in street art can be found on a wall in Fort Knox, Kentucky, drawn in chalk and dated May 13th, 1937, as seen in the History Channel documentary titled “Fort Knox: Secrets Revealed,”[1] (shown below). The phrase was originally quoted in Season 8 Episode 7 of South Park titled “Goobacks,” which aired on April 28th, 2004. In the episode, time-travelling immigrants from the future come to South Park in search of jobs. After newcomers take over the job market and drive down wages, a town meeting is held to discuss the immigration problem, during which construction worker Darryl Weathers complains that the future immigrants “took our jobs.” On July 25, 2012, reddit user brundle_fly submitted the question "I hate the movie "Avatar." What do you hate that everyone else seems to enjoy?" on the r/AskReddit subreddit[1], one of the replies was "HIMYM. Awful, awful show."[2], to which Apostolate replied with a Barney Stinson Gif calling him a jerk. User Drunken_Economist posted a Gif of himself with a deck of cards with one with the words "Nobody Cares, Apostolate" written on.[3]  Gorillaz is a virtual band of cartoon characters created by frontman of Britpop band Blur Damon Albarm[2] and co-creator of the comic Tank Girl, Jamie Hewlett.[3] The band, consisting of four animated members, released their first self-titled album in March 2001, which sold more than 7 million copies and earned them a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records for Most Successful Virtual Band.[4] Their second album Demon Days[5] was released in May 2005. The album artwork, which was inspired by the Beatles’ 1970 album Let It Be, features the caricatures of four bandmates, bassist Murdoc (shown top, left) vocalist 2-D (shown top, right), guitarist Noodle (shown bottom, left) and drummer Russel (shown bottom, right). The album peaked at #1 in the United Kingdom and France, while reaching #2 in Australia, Germany, Ireland and New Zealand. Online, tracks from the album have been played on Last.FM[6] more than 35 million times. The first parody of the cover was created by deviantArt user bundycoot[8] on August 16th, 2005, replacing the Gorillaz members with characters from the children’s television show Kim Possible.   On August 21st, 2012, celebrity gossip site TMZ released nude photos of Prince Harry of Wales[15], the fourth-in-line for the British throne, playing strip billiards while on vacation in Las Vegas, Nevada.[1] The story was subsequently picked up by many mainstream news sources, including CNN[2], The New York Times[3] and The Huffington Post[4] among others. The photographs were met by mixed reactions, with TMZ's poll revealing that 65 percent of 208,002 readers found the photo to be "awesome" rather than "disgraceful," while The Guardian[21] speculated that the royal aids may urge the British media not to republish the photographs in respecting the prince's privacy. Shortly after the TMZ post began to spread online, former Royal Marine Lee Kirton and former member of the King’s Royal Hussars[5] Jordan Wylie created a Facebook group page entitled “Support Prince Harry with a naked salute!”[6] The page asked supporters of Prince Harry to salute the Prince in the nude but to “cover your crown jewels” when sending in photos. As of September 4th, 2012, more than 35,600 people have joined the group and at least a hundred photos have been submitted to the group.  The original comic is an excerpt from the opening panel of a short story comic strip illustrated by Jesse Nylund[2] of Completely Serious Comics[1], originally uploaded on January 9th, 2011. In the scene (shown below, left), the character claims that nothing is funnier than "a monkey in a suit" after another passing person suggests that a baby in a suit with a cigar would be more humorous. Shocked, the character resorts to drinking alone in the depressing final panel. One of the earliest parodies of the comic (shown below, right) was used to critique someone for posting the original pane on FunnyJunk[3] on June 6th, 2012. The parody urges that original content (OC) is funnier than reposts. [WIP]    On September 25th, 2012, Redditor CallMeDOK submitted a photo titled "Photobombing Stingray" (shown below, left) to the Advice Animals subreddit[2] depicting a stingray posing behind two girls in bikinis. The caption read "Killed Steve Irwin / Killin it with the ladies," referencing television personality's untimely death in 2006 after being pierced in the chest with a stingray barb. The submission earned 3067 upvotes and 1134 points overall. The following day, Redditor epic676 submitted a similar photo, this time depicting three young women, Kendall Harlan, Sarah Bourland and Natalie Zaysoff, startled at the stingray's suprise appearance, with the title "I see your stingray Photobomb and raise you!"[1] to /r/Funny. It received 12,972 upvotes, 2365 points overall and 484 comments. The photo was originally taken on a spring break trip to Stingray City in the Cayman Islands in 2008, when the women were sophomores at Texas Christian University. The image was originally uploaded to the girls' Facebook pages, where former classmate and Redditor epic676 found it.[3]  The original idea was conceived by the American author, cartoonist, sculptor and engineer Rube Goldberg while drawing cartoons for the New York Evening Mail in 1907. Some of the earliest schematics were illustrated through the inventions of Professor Lucifer Gorgonzola Butts, a fictional character in one of Goldberg's syndicated comic series (shown below). By 1931, the word "Rube Goldberg" had been recognized by the Merriam–Webster dictionary as an adjective, defined as "accomplishing something simple through complex means." In 1949, Purdue University held the first Rube Goldberg Machine Contest[1], in which college students built devices to complete a simple task in a minimum of 20 steps. The contest was held annually by the Theta Tau and Triangle fraternities until its hiatus in 1956, however, the event was revived for all Purdue students in 1983. When the first episode premiered of the series, the infamous mantra was spoken a few minutes into the airing. The phrase can be heard around the 3:10 mark in the following video: Although it seemed like a temporary phrase that wouldn't stick around for very long in the series, it became a recurring chant used by large crowds of robot bandits to rile up everyone to kill and devour Casshern in several more episodes following the first. The thematic element became quite popular on message boards, most notably 4chan. On October 28th, 2010, Redditor OrdinaryPanda submitted a post to the /r/AskReddit[1] subreddit, which asked what words or phrases other Redditors misunderstood as children. In the comments section of the post, Redditor Lord_Baron confessed to mishearing the quote "Knowledge is power – Francis Bacon" as Knowledge is power, France is bacon." Prior to being archived, the commented accumulated over 7,600 up votes. On July 25th, 2011, Redditor raks1991 submitted a post titled "We told them.." to the /r/pics[10] subreddit, featuring a photo of several politicians, including Ronald Reagan and George Bush Sr., and the caption "We told them wealth/ would 'trickle down'!" (shown below, left). Prior to being archived, the post received over 7,475 up votes and 220 comments. The original photo was taken by Time[11] magazine photographer Diana Walker after Walter Cronkite interviewed President Ronald Reagan at the Oval Office on March 3rd, 1981 (shown below, right). "After Walter Cronkite's last interview with the President as the anchor of the CBS Evening News, there was a little celebration in the room off the Oval Office," recounts photographer Diana Walker. "White House staffers, including Vice President Bush, enjoyed a good laugh over a joke that has never become public."  On July 14th, 2011, Tumblr introduced a new type of posts known as "photosets" to allow its users to publish a collection of images as a single blog post. The earliest known instances of a fake photoset were created more than a year later by Tumblr user oh-totoro on August 3rd, 2012, comprised of several animated GIFs taken from the 1986 animated feature film Laputa: Castle in the Sky.[1] The GIF photoset was met by positive reception within Tumblr community, gaining more than 32,300 notes within the first month. Throughout the month of August, oh-totoro continued to curate similarly framed GIFs featuring various scenes from Japanese animation films. The photograph (shown below, left) was originally submitted to the /r/pics[1] subreddit by Redditor ti84power on November 7th, 2011. Titled "TI84 + like a boss," the post received over 27,500 up votes and 1,300 comments prior to being archived. Since then, the image has been re-submitted to the /r/funny[3] subreddit on two separate occasions in March and September 2012, the latter of which accumulated over 12,000 up votes and 600 comments within two days. On September 11th, 2012, the first captioned instance based on the photograph was submitted to the /r/AdviceAnimals[2] subreddit, featuring the caption “Sorry, ladies… when the calculator’s clickin’ / there can be no dickin’” (shown below, right). "Those Who Fight Further" is the normal boss theme song in Final Fantasy VII which was first released in Japan in 1997.[1] As same as other Final Fantasy series songs, it was written by the Japanese video game composer Nobuo Uematsu.[2] Since it gains a large popularity among fans, its arranged version have been included to several subsequent spin-off titles in the series : Final Fantasy VII Advent Children_[3], Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII[4], Dissidia Final Fantasy[5] and Theatrhythm Final Fantasy.[6] "Oiyoiyo" is the remark by Vaan, the protagonist in the video game. And the correct pronunciation for this misheard phrase is "Tobioriro!" (飛び降りろ!, Jump Down!). The scene including this remark appeared for the first time in the official trailer movie that was announced at Square Enix Party held on July 30th, 2005.[2] The voice actor for Vaan was Kouhei Takeda (武田 航平)[3], who was a 19-year-old actor originally from a fashion model and unfortunately, his acting hadn't been trained so much yet. Hentai and doujin manga are a common interest with certain internet communities, with a large number of these manga being uploaded to the internet. The largest English speaking hentai website, Fakku, attracts over 150 million pageviews each month.[11] Due to the high numbers of available manga, the topics and scenes covered in these can differ a lot. Regardless of their high popularity in both western and eastern cultures, most manga shared in western culture are still fan translated from the original Japanese or Korean version and, thus, not done professionally. The Japanese and Korean vocabulary, where most originate from also differs from the western vocabulary on grammar and spelling, making some fan translations poor in quality. Because of all these factors, the results of these translations often contain both absurd and humorous quotes and phrases as a result. Hentai Quotes are most commonly shared on the online imageboard 4chan, most specifically the /a/ (anime & manga) board and the /h/ (hentai) board. Archived threads sharing hentai quotes can be found on Chanarchive[2] as early as August 2007.[1] In early September 2012, a photograph of a young female performing a 45 degree angle split between two bunk bed ladders began to spread on the Chinese social networking site Weibo. Though her identity is not currently known, she is allegedly a junior art student from Shandong University at Weihai.[18] The concept of "food pornography" was reportedly coined by American feminist critic Rosalind Coward in her 1984 book Female Desire[1], in which she wrote: Cooking food and presenting it beautifully is an act of servitude. It is a way of expressing affection through a gift… That we should aspire to produce perfectly finished and presented food is a symbol of a willing and enjoyable participation in servicing others. Food pornography exactly sustains these meanings relating to the preparation of food. The kinds of picture used always repress the process of production of a meal. They are always beautifully lit, often touched up. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the term was used in a number of academic papers and culinary news articles, including Los Angeles Times' profile article[6] about the special food company Hickory Farms in December 1993 and another article[7] about business executive travels in July 1994, as well as The Telegraph's report[3] on the trend of "food porn" in reaction to the low-calorie and diet food movement in May 2000. The Telegraph article credited the Center for Science in the Public Interest with coining the term in 1998 through its regular column called "Right Stuff vs. Food Porn."[2] In the early 1980s, Pepperidge Farm began airing a commercial featuring an elderly man reminiscing about raisin bread that his grandmother used to make with the tagline “Pepperidge Farm remembers” (shown below, left). Online interest in the commercial resurged more than a decade later with a Family Guy parody in Season 5 Episode 3 “Hell Comes to Quahod,” in which an old man blackmails the audience into buying Milano cookies. The episode was originally aired on September 24th, 2006. On June 4th, 2012, Redditor redherpbluederp submitted a post to the /r/funny[6] subreddit titled “God dammit, YouTube commentator!”, which included a screenshot of a YouTube comment referencing the Pepperidge Farm commercial (shown below). Within four months, the post received over 12,725 up votes and 190 comments.  On October 15th, 2012, Redditor Glibhat submitted a post to the /r/funny[1] subreddit titled "I took this picture of a crow yesterday," featuring a photograph of a black crow with a prominent upturned beak (shown below, left). Within 24 hours, the post received over 23,500 up votes and 700 comments. Redditor CyaSteve replied to the post with a three-pane comic, characterizing the crow as a stereotypical Internet tough guy (shown below, right).  "The Decisive Battle" is a normal boss theme in Final Fantasy VI which was first released in Japan in 1994.[1] As same as other Final Fantasy series songs, it was written by the Japanese video game composer Nobuo Uematsu.[2] Since it gains a large popularity among fans, its arranged version have been included to several subsequent spin-off titles in the series : Dissidia Final Fantasy[3] and Theatrhythm Final Fantasy.[4], Final Fantasy Fables: Chocobo Tales[5] and Dragon Quest & Final Fantasy in Itadaki Street Portable.[6]   "Semi-Don" is originally a mere joke for a typical moe situation like these images below, which are mostly shown in Japanese comics for girls. And around September 2012, this situation became to be called as "Kabe-Don" (壁ドン, lit. Wall Bam) on the Japanese web, which is a connected word of Kabe, a wall, and Don (Bam), the sound of wildly putting hands or feet on it. The first appearance of the phrase "Semi-don" was a 4 paned picture in a tweet posted by a Japanese user named Naruse, Hatoh (成瀬ハトゥ) in October 13th, 2012.[1] Transcript: This funny maneuver wasn't her original invention because the same pose was appeared in an other online gag comic in 2008.[2] However, this tweet had scored 24000+ retweets and 8500+ favorites within its first week due to her very catchy naming to this pose "Semi-Don".   The phrase gained much of its online notoriety as an oddly phrased comment posted on the adult media website Pornhub[7] by user ross53545 sometime in 2009 (shown below, left). Featuring Dutch artist Frans Hals' 1684 painting of French philosopher and mathematician René Descartes as the avatar (shown below, right), user ross53545 wrote "give her the dick."  The term "dox" was initially used by computer hackers involved in pirated software[8] distribution to describe various documents relating to new updates, cracks or patches. Beginning in the early to mid-2000s, the term "doxxing" became associated with the act of leaking an individual's personal information for retaliation or vigilantism. In the late 2000s, it rapidly grew into a harassment tactic used by members of Anonymous during their operations. In China and elsewhere, similar forms of privacy-invasive behaviors emerged through groups like Human Flesh Search Engine.  The clip of "Kareteci Kiz" with the edited scream was originally uploaded to YouTube by Crazy Dave Tape[1] in late September 2012 as "Radical Ending 2: Death Scream."[2] This video was reuploaded by YouTuber Plantyzombie who renamd it "Worst Movie Death Scene Ever," causing Crazy Dave Tape's original version to get flagged for a copyright violation and removed.[3] Plantyzombie's version received 17.623.909 views, 85.925 likes and 5.293 dislikes. It was also flagged as well until the recover. Prior to the edited version, "Kareteci Kiz" was uploaded in nine parts by Turkish user arabulucu84bjk, who uploaded since 2007 several turkish movies to YouTube. Ferruh's death scene is mentioned in the eigth part of the film in arabulucu84bjk's uploads, it was uploaded on November 4, 2008.    "Poka Poka" (ポカポカ) is a Japanese onomatopoeia for a sound of pounding something mildly, which sounds very cute to the Japanese sensibility. And videos in this seires is made from combining two "Poka Poka" materials. One, the action, is taken from just a 1-second footage in the opening movie of a Japanese TV anime series for a manga Seitokai Yakuindomo written by Tozen Ujiie[1] (Shown below, left). It was aired from July to October in 2010. The other, an electro-pop tune playing in the background, is a vocal remixed version of Hammer song, which was composed by a famous NND user Satsuki Ga Tenkomori[2] and sung by moe voice actor/singer Kana in 2009 (Shown below, right).[3] The trigger of this series first combined these materials and reproduced the action by Akio Fudo and Michiya Kuon from a Japanese TV anime series for a video game Inazuma Eleven produced by Level-5.[4] This video was uploaded to NND on July 14th, 2010.[5]   The phrase “Check Your Privilege” was used as early as March 2006 on the social justice blog Shrub.com[1] in an article explaining how to accept one’s inherent privilege and understand situations that members of non-privileged groups are going through. Written and illustrated by Japanese children's book author Keiko Sena[1], Don't Want to Go to Bed? has been a longtime best-seller with more than 2 million copies sold[2] since its first release in 1969. The storyline of the book is quite simple, which follows a sleepless child's nighttime adventure in the company of a ghost. The book is also noted for its unusually dark plot line and unique style of paper collage art. During the predawn of Futaba Channel in the early 2000s, many members of the community began using the cover art of the book as a reaction face image or a personal avatar to identify themselves as night owl users who would often stay up late to browse the latest threads. Having established itself as a widespread fad on the site before the launch of Nijiura board, Futaba Channel's equivalent of 4chan's /b/ (random) board, "Don't Want to Go to Bed?" is considered one of the first known internet memes to emerge from the imageboard community. The original comic was made by famous webcomic artist KC Green, in a sub-section, called Droop, of his former blog[1]. He put all the Droop comics in a file directory at comicwithoutviolence.com along with another section of comics called Bee power[2]. Because no archive has been made as for now, it is impossible to tell when exactly he drew the 4-pane comic simply titled "Ghost Blowjob"[3]: However, one of its earliest repost on the web dates back as far as September 1st 2006 in a WTF.com forum thread[4]. Snow Goose was written by a Japanese composer Mutsuhiko Izumi for the first rhythm game of jubeat, that was released on the Japanese arcade on July 24, 2008. This song was ported to beatmania IIDX 19 Lincle[2] together with "I'm so happy" in 2011. And its remixed version was included in Guitar Freaks XG3 & Drummania XG3[3] in 2012.   Why is Idiots X originated on the "Yahoo Answers"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sites/yahoo-answers "Religion and Spirituality" forum. A humble user made a question titled, "Why is idiots deny koran?" They followed it with a body of "Koran is of ultimates of all books and is most logicing book to ever write." This spawned lots of feedback and general mockery of the user, named Wahālan. In January of 2012, Pinterest user and Brooklyn-based writer Jessica Hulett[4] created The Claire Danes Cry Face Project[1] pinboard. The first pin featured a screen capture of actress Claire Danes crying as she appears in the Showtime television drama series Homeland, which was originally posted on the single topic blog The Cry Face[3] on December 15th, 2011 (shown below). The phrase “that’s cute” has been used as a colloquial expression for many years prior to its online adaptations. The first Urban Dictionary[1] entry was submitted by user sweetsean93 on February 2nd, 2010, defining the phrase as a sarcastic declaration used in response to an annoying comment or sophomoric statement. Redditor AlphaF submitted a post titled "Mom was worried about my trip to the Grand Canyon, I sent her this picture" to the /r/funny[1] subreddit on November 15th, 2012, featuring a photograph in which she appeared to be falling to her death off a cliff at the Grand Canyon (shown below). Within 24 hours, the post received over 98,400 upvotes, 94,500 downvotes and 3,300 comments.       Both the song and the music video for "It’s Thanksgiving” were written and produced by Ark Music Factory founder Patrice Wilson[1], who also uploaded it via his YouTube channel on November 7th, 2012. Starring 12-year-old Nicole Westbrook from Lake Balboa, California, the video accumulated over 7.7 million views and 68,700 comments within eight days. While the original video has since been removed, mirrors have been reuploaded by various other YouTubers (shown below).  YouTuber TheShelteredLife uploaded a video titled "Tutorial: Hot do do the Cup Beat/Clap" on January 27th, 2008, which demonstrated how to use a plastic cup to perform a beat (shown below). On June 8th, 2009, YouTuber Lulapinga uploaded a video in which Lulu and the Lampshades members Luisa and Jemma perform an adaptation of the 1937 song "Miss Me When I'm Gone" by Mainer's Mountaineers[2] hitting two plastic cups on a table to create a beat (shown below). As of November 21st, 2012, the video has accumulated over 1.67 million views. Titled “Sloth on the Moon,” the photoshopped image was created by digital artist Pedro Dionísio and uploaded to his deviantArt[3] account on January 17th, 2012. The Relevant Steve Harvey meme first appeared on Facebook displaying the text MY REACTION WHEN MY GF GIVES ME A BJ WITHOUT ASKING on top of a GIF image of Steve Harvey excitedly dancing. On January 13th, 2009, YouTuber Lonely Boy Ind.[1] uploaded a video titled "Cool Guy Has a Chill Day." As of October 2014, the video has gained over 3.7 million views. The earliest online definition of the term was submitted by Online Slang Dictionary[14] user Dan P. on April 27th, 1998, identifying the word as a synonym for “muscular.”   The exact origin is currently unknown. On August 17th, 2011, the 4gifs Tumblr[4] published a black-and-white photograph of a young girl holding a telephone with the caption "Tyrone I told yo black ass not to call me no mo wass wrong wit u nigga" written in the Comic Sans font (shown below). Within the next fifteen months, the post received over 21,900 notes. Twitter user Bronwyn Iler Page tweeted a photograph of a Japanese snow macaque monkey wearing a shearling coat at an IKEA store in Toronto, Canada on December 9th, 2012. Within three days, the tweet received over 415 retweets and 158 favorites. Umm saw a monkey in the #ikea parking lot. twitter.com/broniewyn/stat… — Bronwyn Iler Page (@broniewyn) December 9, 2012 (W.I.P.)            The story was written by GameFAQs user KI Simpson[1] and published in a Suicide Mouse thread[2] on January 19th, 2010. In the story, Bart is sucked out of a plane and much of the rest of the episode focuses on the Simpsons afterwards crying and acting depressed. At the end of the episode, the name of several Simpsons guest stars appear on tombstones, with those who had passed away at the time of the creepypasta's posting listed with accurate death dates. Simpsons guest stars who had yet to die all had the same date listed as their death date.  Redditor imonfirex727 submitted the first Pickup Line Scientist image macro to the /r/AdviceAnimals[2] subreddit on July 26th, 2011 (shown below). Prior to being archived, the post received over 500 up votes and 25 comments.  On July 13th, 2012, the single topic blog Rich Kids of Instagram[1] was launched as a critique of lavish lifestyles boasted by some teenagers on the app. The anonymous owners of the blog encourage Instagram users to use the hashtag #rkoi to collect the photos. Within two weeks, the hashtag[2] had accrued more than 1,200 Instagram photos.  The image corresponds to a study made ​​by the photographer Federico Gama http://www.federicogama.com/, reflecting the lives of indigenous youth who migrate to cities through documentary photography, "Mazahuacholoskatopunk", as a research tool, at IMJ (Mexican Institute of Youth)http://cendoc.imjuventud.gob.mx/clr/libros/centrolibro.php?libro=0310006.swf Giovanna Plowman uploaded the original video to her Facebook[9] page on January 19th, 2013, in which she removes a tampon off camera and proceeds to put it in her mouth while listening to the song “212” by Azealia Banks. The video was re-uploaded to YouTube later that same day by YouTuber FizzyShizzles, but both copies were subsequently removed for violating the sites' terms of services. Eventually, a mirrored copy was re-uploaded to LiveLeak (shown below). In October 2012, Te’o[1] appeared in a YouTube video to speak about the recent losses of his grandmother and his girlfriend, both of whom had passed away from illnesses only six hours apart on September 12th, 2012.[2] The origin of this meme is a print club sticker picture of four Japanese homeboys pretending to be cool with fist pumping and smug look. And, the message written on the picture by themselves is: "We came by bike." (チャリで来た。). For Japanese sensibilities, this picture looks so much ridiculous because of these reasons: It's uncertain where this picture came from, although someone says it was leaked from back data in print club sticker by video game arcade staff, or uploaded to a mobile social network service popular among junior high / high school students by themselves.

The story is told from the point of view of a traveler who visits “Treasure’s Island," an abandoned Jungle Book-themed Disney resort on an island in the Bahamas, and explores the remains of the incomplete palace. Upon arriving at the resort, the narrator describes the decrepit palace in surreal details, including a wild encounter with an 80-feet-long near a section of the building marked “Mascots Only," where he is greeted by an eerie, photo-negative version of Mickey Mouse. Disney blamed the shallow waters (too shallow for their ships to safely operate) and there was even blame cast on the workers, saying that since they were from the Bahamas, they were too lazy to work a regular schedule. That's where the factual nature of their story ends. It wasn't because of sand, and it obviously wasn't because "foreigners are lazy". Both are convenient excuses. No, I sincerely doubt those reasons were legitimate. Why don't I buy the official story? Because of Mowgli's Palace. Near the beachside city of Emerald Isle in North Carolina, Disney began construction of "Mowgli's Palace" in the late 1990s. The concept was a Jungle-themed resort with a large, you guessed it, PALACE in the center of the whole thing. If you're unfamiliar with the character of Mowgli, then you might better remember the story "The Jungle Book". If you haven't seen it anywhere else, you'd know it as the Disney cartoon from decades past. Mowgli is an abandoned child, in the jungle, essentially raised by animals and simultaneously threatened/pursued by other animals. Mowgli's Palace was a controversial undertaking from the start. Disney bought up a ton of high-priced land for the project, and there was actually a scandal surrounding some of the purchases. The local Government claimed "eminent domain" on people's homes, then turned around and sold the properties to Disney. At one point a home that had just been constructed was immediately condemned with little to no explanation. The land grabbed by the Government was supposedly for some fictional highway project. Knowing full well what was going on, people started calling it "Mickey Mouse Highway". Then there was the concept art. A group of stuffed shirts from Disney Co. actually held a city meeting. They intended to sell everyone on how lucrative this project was going to be for everyone. When they showed the concept art, this gigantic Indian Palace… surrounded by JUNGLE… staffed with men and women in loincloths and tribal gear… well, suffice to say everyone flipped their shit. We're talking about a large Indian Palace, Jungle, and Loincloths not only in the center of a relatively wealth area, but also a somewhat "xenophobic" area of the southern USA. It was a questionable mix at that point in history. One member of the crowd tried to storm the stage, but he was quickly subdued by security after he managed to break one of the presentation boards over his knee. Disney took that community and essentially broke it over its knee, as well. The houses were razed, the land was cleared, and there wasn't a damned thing anyone could do or say about it. Local TV and Newspapers were against the resort at the beginning, but some insane connection between Disney's media holdings and the local venues came into play and their opinions turned on a dime. So anyway, Treasure Island, the Bahamas. Disney sunk those millions in and then split. The same thing happened with Mowgli's Palace. Construction was complete. Visitors actually stayed at the resort. The surrounding communities were flooded with traffic and the usual annoyances associated with an influx of lost and irate tourists. Then it all just stopped. Disney shut it down and nobody knew what the Hell to think. But they were pretty happy about it. Disney's loss was pretty hilarious and wonderful to a large group of folks who didn't want this in the first place. I honestly didn't give the place another thought since hearing it closed over a decade ago. I live maybe four hours from Emerald Isle, so really I only heard the rumblings and didn't experience any of it first-hand. Then I read this article from someone who had explored the Treasure Island resort and posted a whole blog about all the crazy shit he found there. Stuff just… left behind. Things smashed, defaced, probably ruined by the disgruntled former employees who had lost their jobs. Hell, the locals from all around probably had a hand in wrecking that place. People there felt just as angry about Treasure Island as folks here did about Mowgli's Palace. Plus there were rumors that Disney had released their aquarium "stock" into the local waters when they closed… including sharks. Who wouldn't want to take a few swings at some merchandise after that? Well, what I'm getting at is that this blog about Treasure Island got me thinking. Even though many years had passed since its closing, I figured it might be cool to do some "Urban Exploration" at Mowgli's Palace. Take some photos, write about my experience, and probably see if there was anything I could take home as a memento. I'm not going to say I wasted no time in getting there, because honestly it took me another year after I first found that Treasure Island article to get around to going up to Emerald Isle. Over the course of that year, I did a lot of research on the Palace resort… or rather, I tried to. Naturally, no official Disney site or resource made any mention of the place. That had been scrubbed clean. Even odder, however, was that nobody before myself had apparently thought to blog about the place or even post a photo. None of the local TV or Newspaper sites had one word about the place, though that was to be expected since they had all swung Disney's way. They wouldn't be out there lauding their embarrassment, you know? Recently, I learned that corporations can actually ask Google, for example, to remove links from search results… basically for no good reason. Looking back, it's probably not that nobody spoke of the resort, but rather their words were made inaccessible. So in the end I could barely find the place. All I had to go on was an old-as-hell map I'd received in the mail back in the 90s. It was a promotional item sent out to people who had recently been to Disney world, and I guess since I had been there in the late 80s, that was "recent". I didn't really intend to hang onto it. It just got shoved in with my books and comics from my childhood. I'd only remembered it months into my research, and even then it took me another few weeks to locate the storage bin my parents had shoved it all into. But I DID find it. Locals were no help, as most were transplants who had moved to the beach in recent years… or old residents who just sneered at me and made rude gestures the second I managed to say "Where would I find Mowgli's---" The drive took me through an inordinately long corridor of overgrowth. Tropical plants that had run rampant and overpopulated the area mixed with the native species of flora that actually BELONGED there and had tried to reclaim the land. I was in awe when I reached the front gates of the resort. Tremendous, monolithic wooden gates whose supports to either side looked like they must've been cut from giant sequoias. The gate itself had been gouged in several places by woodpeckers and eaten away at the base by burrowing insects. Hanging on the gate was a sheet of metal, some random scrap, with hand-painted letters scrawled in black. "ABANDONED BY DISNEY". Clearly the handiwork of some past local or an employee who wanted to make some small protest. The gates were open enough to walk through, but not drive, so grabbing my digital camera and the map, whose flip-side showed a layout of the resort, I set off on foot. The inner grounds of the place were just as overgrown as the entryway. Palm tree stood untended and ragged among piles of their own coconuts. Banana plants similarly stood in their own stinking, bug-riddled refuse. There was this sort of clash between order and chaos, as carefully planted rows of perennial flowers mixed with obnoxious tall weeds and stinking, blackened mushrooms. All that remained of any outdoor structures were broken, rotting wood and various charred bits of unidentifiable material. What was most likely an information booth or an outdoor bar was now simply a pile of assorted debris chopped up by past vandalism and ravaged by weather. The most interesting thing on the grounds was a statue of Baloo, the friendly bear from the Jungle Book, which stood in a sort of courtyard in front of the main building. He was frozen in a jovial wave toward no one, staring into empty space with a silly, toothy grin as bird shit covered whole swaths of his "fur" and vines ensnared his platform. I approached the main building – the PALACE – only to find the outside of the building covered in graffiti where the original paint hadn't peeled and chipped away. The front doors weren't just open, they had been taken off their hinges and were stolen. Above the front doors, or the gaping maw where they had been, someone had once again painted "ABANDONED BY DISNEY". I wish I could tell you about all the awesome stuff I saw inside the Palace. Forgotten statues, abandoned cash registers, a full-fledged secret society of homeless bums… but no. The inside of the building was so stark, so bare, that I actually think people had stolen the molding off the walls. Anything that was too big to steal… counters, desks, giant fake trees… they were all resting amid this empty echo chamber that amplified my every step like a slow rat-a-tat of a machine gun. I checked the floorplan and headed to all the locations that might seem in any way interesting. The kitchen was as you'd imagine… an industrial food prep area with all the appliances and space, no expenses spared. Every glass surface was broken, every door knocked off its hinges, every metal surface kicked and dented. The entire place smelled like very old piss. The huge freezer, not even remotely cool now, had row upon row of empty shelf space. Hooks hung from the ceiling, probably for hanging cuts of meat, and as I stood inside for a moment, I noticed they were swinging. Each hook swung in a random direction, but their movements were so slow and small that it was almost impossible to see. I figured it had been caused by my footsteps, so I stopped one from swinging by clutching it in my fist, then carefully letting go, but within seconds it started to swing once more. The bathrooms were in much the same state as the rest of the place. Just like the Treasure Island resort, someone had methodically smashed each porcelain commode with coconuts and other implements. There was about a half inch of rancid, stinking stagnant water on the floor, so I didn't stay there very long. What's odd is that the toilets and the sinks (and the bidets in the ladies' room, yes I went there) all dripped, leaked, or just ran freely. It seemed to me that they should've shut the water off long, LONG ago. There were plenty of rooms in the resort, but naturally I didn't have time to look through them all. The few I did peer into were similarly wrecked, and I didn't expect to find anything there. I thought there was actually a television or radio in one room, as I really think I heard a quiet conversation coming out. Though it was like a whisper, probably my own breathing echoing in the silence, or just another case of the sound of flowing water playing tricks on the mind, this is what it sounded like… 1: "I didn't believe it." 2: (short, unknown reply) 1: "I didn't know that. I didn't know that." 2: "Your father told you." 1: (unknown reply, or possibly just weeping.) I know, I know, that sounds ridiculous. I'm just telling you what I experienced, why I thought there might've been something running in that room – or worse, some vagrants who had holed up there and probably would've knifed me. At the front doors of the Palace again, I figured I hadn't found anything of note and had wasted the trip up. As I looked out the door, I noticed something interesting in the courtyard that I had apparently missed. Something that would give me at least ONE thing to show for all my trouble, even if it was just a photograph. There as a lifelike statue of a python, maybe eighty feet long, coiled up and "sunning" itself on a pedestal right in the center of the area. It was almost time for the sun to start setting, so the light fell onto the object in the PERFECT way for a photograph. I approached the python and snapped a photo. Then I stood on my toes and snapped another. I moved closer again to get the detail of its face. Slowly, casually, the python lifted its head, looked directly into my eyes, turned, and slithered off the pedestal, across the grass, and into the trees. All eighty feet of it. Its head long disappeared into the woods before its tail even left the sunning spot. Disney had released all their exotic animals onto the grounds. Right there on my floorplan map was the "Reptile House". I should have known. I'd read about the sharks at Treasure Isle, and I should have KNOWN they'd done this. I was dumbfounded, just utterly stupefied. My mouth must've been hanging open for the longest time before I came back down to Earth and snapped it shut. I blinked a few times and backed away from where the snake had been, back toward the Palace. Even though it was totally gone, I still wasn't taking any chances and backed my way into the building. It took a few deep breaths and slaps to my own face to get myself right in the head again after that. I looked for a place to sit down, as my legs were feeling a bit like jelly at this point. Of course, there WAS no place to sit down unless I wanted to recline in the broken glass and dead leaf carpet or haul myself up onto a desk of questionably reliability. I had seen some stairs near the Palace's lobby and decided to go have a seat there until I felt better. The staircase was far enough away from the front of the building to be relatively clean, save for a startling accumulation of dust. I pulled a wedge of metal off the wall, once again painted with the "ABANDONED BY DISNEY" motto I'd become accustomed to. I placed the wedge on the stairs and sat on it to keep at least somewhat clean. The stairway led downward, below ground level. Using my camera flash as a sort of improvised flashlight, I could see that the stair case ended in a metal mesh door with a padlock. A sign on the door… a REAL sign… read "MASCOTS ONLY! THANK YOU!". This perked up my spirits a little bit, for two reasons. One, a Mascots-Only area would have definitely had some interesting stuff back in the day… Two, the padlock was still in place. Nobody had gone down there. Not the vandals, not the looters, nobody. This was the one place I could actually "explore" and perhaps find something interesting to photograph or wantonly steal. I had come to the Palace essentially agreeing with myself that it was okay to take anything I wanted because – hey – "abandoned". It didn't take much to bust the lock. Well, actually that's wrong. It didn't take much to bust the metal plate on the wall that the padlock was hooked to. Time and decay had done most of the work for me, and I was able to bend the metal plate enough to pull the screws out of the wall – something nobody else had apparently thought of, or hadn't been able to do at the time. The Mascots-Only area was a startling and very welcomed change from the rest of the building I'd seen. For one, every second or third fluorescent light overhead was illuminated, even though they flickered and faded randomly. Also, nothing had been stolen or broken, even if age and exposure were definately taking their toll. Tables had note pads and pens, there were clocks… even a punch-in clock on the wall complete with filled-out time cards. Chairs were scattered around and there was even a small break room with an old, static-filled television and long rotted-out food and drink on the counters. It was like one of those post-apocalypse movies where everything is left in the state of evacuation. As I walked the maze-like sub-basement hallways of the Mascots-Only area, the sights just became more and more interesting. As I went further, desks and tables were knocked over, papers scattered and almost melded with the damp floor, and a large carpet of mold was slowly overtaking the real rotting crimson floor-covering. Everything was just sort of "squishy". Anything wood disintegrated into mush when I applied even the least amount of force, and clothing items hanging on hooks in one of the rooms simply fell to moist threads if I tried to unhook them. One thing that annoyed me was that the light was becoming more sparse and unreliable as I went further into the dank, suffocating depths of the place. Eventually, I reached a black and yellow striped door with the words "CHARACTER PREP 1" stenciled on it. The door wouldn't open at first. I figured this was probably where the costumes were kept, and I definately wanted a photograph of that twisted, stinking mess. Try as I might, whatever angle or trick I tried, the door wouldn't budge. That is, until I gave up and started to walk away. That was when there was a slight popping sound and the door creaked open slowly. Inside, the room was completely dark. Pitch black. I used the camera flash to look for a light switch in the wall buy the door, but there was nothing. As I made my search, I was jarred out of my sense of excitement by a loud electrical buzz. Rows of lights overhead suddenly flashed to life, flickering and fading in and out like the rest I had passed. It took a second for my eyes to adjust, and it seemed like the light was going to just keep getting brighter until all the bulbs exploded… but just when I thought it would reach that critical stage, the lights dimmed a bit and steadied. The room was exactly as I had pictured it. Various Disney costumes hung on the walls, fully put together like strange cartoon cadavers hung from invisible nooses. There was an entire rack of loincloths and "native" clothes on hangers toward the back. What I found odd, and what I wanted to photograph right away, was a Mickey Mouse costume at the center of the room. Unlike the other costumes, it was lying on its back in the center of the floor like a murder victim. The fur on the costume was rotten and shedding, creating bare patches. What was even odder, however, was the coloring of the costume. It was like a photo negative of the actual Mickey Mouse. Black where he should be white and white where he should be black. His normally red overalls were light blue. The sight was off-putting enough that I actually put off photographing the thing until last. I took a picture of the costumes hanging on the walls. Upward angles, downward angles, side shots to show an entire row of frozen, putrid cartoon faces, some with plastic eyes missing. Then I decided to stage a shot. Just one of the bedraggled character heads on the slick, grimy floor. I reached for the headpiece of a Donald Duck costume and carefully removed it so the thing wouldn't fall apart in my hands. As I looked into the face of the wide-eyed, moldering head, a loud clattering sound made me jump with fright. I looked down at my feet, and there between my shoes was a human skull. It had fallen out of the mascot head and shattered into pieces at me feet; only the empty face and lower jaw remained, staring up at me. I dropped the Duck head immediately, as you'd expect, and moved for the door. As I stood in the doorway, I looked back to the skull on the floor. I had to take a picture of it, you know? I HAD to, for any number of reasons that may seem silly, but only if you don't think it through. I'd need proof of what happened, especially if Disney was going to somehow make this go away. I had no doubt in my mind, right from the start, that even if it was just gross negligence, Disney was RESPONSIBLE for this. That's when Mickey, that photo negative, opposite-Mickey in the middle of the floor, started to get up. First sitting up, then climbing to its feet, the Mickey Mouse costume… or whoever was inside of it, stood there at the center of the room, its fake face just starting directly at me as I mumbled "No…" over and over and over… With shaking hands, a violently thrashing heart, and legs that had once again turned to jelly, I managed to lift the camera and aim it at the opposite creature now quietly sizing me up. The digital camera's screen displayed only dead pixels in the shape of the thing. It was a perfect silhouette of the Mickey costume. As the camera moved in my unsteady hands, the dead pixels spread, marring the screen wherever Mickey's outline moved to. Then the camera died. Went blank and quiet and… broken. I raised my eyes once again to the Mickey Mouse costume. "Hey," it said in a hushed, perverted, but perfectly executed Mickey Mouse voice, "Wanna see my head come off?" It started to pull at its own head, working its clumsy, glove-clad fingers around its neck with clawing, impatient movements similar to a wounded man trying to pull himself free of a predator's jaws… As it worked its digits into its neck… so much blood… So much thick, chunky, yellow blood… I turned away as I heard a sickening tearing of cloth and flesh… only cared about getting away. Above the doorway out of this room, I saw the final message clawed into the metal with bone or fingernails… "ABANDONED BY GOD" I never got the pictures out of the camera. I never wrote the blog entry about it. After I ran from that place, fled for my sanity if not my very life, I knew why Disney didn't want anyone to know about this place. They didn't want anyone like me getting in. They didn't want anything like that getting out. On September 12th, 2013, YouTuber KAftC[1] uploaded a video titled "Lily's Disneyland Surprise… AGAIN," which shows two sisters, Lily and Chloe, reacting to the news of a surprise trip to Disneyland on their way to school. As the older sister, Lily, breaks into tears of joy, Chloe is briefly seen on camera with a disturbed look on her face.  While the exact origin of the term "dad joke" is unknown, the earliest known use of the term online was posted in a thread by B3ta Forums[5] member rob on December 10th, 2003, which asked other members to submit "lame jokes" made by their fathers. In the first 48 hours, the thread received 15 pages worth of replies. On November 11th, 2013, Michael Kaufman read a letter allegedly written by his brother Andy at the Andy Kaufman Awards in New York City, claiming that he was still alive and living in seclusion with a woman with whom he'd had a daughter. Kaufman subsequently invited Tatarsky onstage, who claimed to be the daughter of Kaufman and that the comedian had staged his own death before going into hiding in May of 1984.   The phrase originates from Season 1 Episode 2b from the animated television series Ed, Edd n Eddy, originally aired on January 11th, 1999, Ed says the phrase “swiggity swag, what’s in the bag?” while trying to sound “cool” (shown below). However, the phrase didn't enter widespread usage until sometime in late 2012, shortly after the slang term swag began to rise in popularity. The TVCM series for that table salt, including famous sound logo of a man barking out the product name in a strong staccato manner, has been aired since 1997 and it has been familiar to almost all Japanese people. The melody for this line is taken from an enka[2] song "Otoko Ryu" (男龍, lit. Man Dragon) by a Japanese singer Yasuo Takajo who are also barking out it in the TVCMs. According to the hoax investigation website Snopes,[1] a story about a Chinese man named Jian Feng who sued his wife for bearing unattractive offspring was published as early as June 2004, when it was published in the Heilongjiang Morning Post,[2] a newspaper known for publishing urban legends without verification. The article claimed that Feng won a lawsuit against his wife after she confessed to having plastic surgery following the birth of their "ugly baby daughter." A Chinese man has divorced and sued his wife for £55,000 after discovering she'd had plastic surgery before they met. Jian Feng, 38, was said to have been "horrified" when she gave birth to an ugly baby daughter. He suspected her of having an affair. His wife then confessed to having plastic surgery costing £70,000 in South Korea before they met and showed him a picture of how she used to look. He filed for divorce two years after marrying her following a whirlwind romance. The Heilongjiang Morning Post said Jian successfully sued for deceit. In 2012, the story became paired with an advertisement for a Taipei-based plastic surgery clinic featuring a studio photograph of a family. The advertisement, which shows two attractive-looking parents and three children with unflatteringly small eyes, was accompanied by the tagline “The only thing you have to worry you about after plastic surgery is the explaining you’ll have to do to your children.” On April 24th, 2009, a Japanese idol Tsuyoshi Kusanagi, the image character of Japan's transition to digital television in 2011, forced to step down from the campaign by a scandal that he was arrested for public indecency of going on the naked, drunken rampage in park.[3] Just three days after the incident, National Association of Commercial Broadcasters in Japan (NAB)[4], which was relabeled the Japan Commercial Broadcasting Association in 2012, revealed a new mascot for the campaign named "Chidejika", which name is a compound word of "Chideji" (地デジ, abbreviated term of Digital Terrestrial Television) and "Shika" (シカ, Deer). The sudden appearance of new mascot soon became to a laughingstock as a quickie character for compensation. Besides, Chidejika got a much attention in a negative way because its looks, only wearing something like a leotard or a school swimsuit, had an enough impact to make many people imagine a barnyard humor due to the influence of that incident. An online news article reported more than 400 parody illustrations or moe gijinka versions for Chidejika had been posted to illustrators communities[5][6] within its first week.[7] The critical failure was NAB showed stereotyped reactions against those internet users innocent mischiefs. They took those parodies seriously, appealed to news media that they had prepared that digital deer since before[8], its clothes wasn't a swimsuits[9], and showed complaint to sexy illustrations for Chidejika.[7] Moreover, an online gossip news getnews.jp reported that NAB was planning to take a tough line with not only unauthorized reproductions of Chidejika pictures but also parody creations to protect their own copyright as usual.[10] NAB's small-minded attitude rubbed Japanese internet users the wrong way. Then, people with humorous anger against NAB began to lionize "Analoguma", a Shift-JIS art character of Kumar (クマー) or Pedobear putting a Yagi-Uda antenna[11] on its head, as the antithesis of Chidejika. This character for analog terrestrial television was born on /news/ board in the Japanese anonymous text board community 2channel on April 28th[12], and quickly imported to Chidejika-related threads in /mnewsplus/ (headline news of sports and gossips) board. Throughout those threads, Analoguma became to be drawn as the antithesis of Chidejika, a copyright-free mascot in a campaign for postponing the transition or promoting to take this opportunity to stop watching TV. Due to the nature of the images, it's hard to pinpoint where the first such image was created. On March 30th, 2005, a photo of a banana placed against a TV set was posted on the blog Rockdogdesigns[7] with a description explaining the TV was for sale: On November 22nd, 2011, the "TunaMeltsMyHeart" Instagram[2] feed was launched, featuring photographs of Tuna, a chihuahua-dachsund mix with an "agressive overbite/lower jawline-dysfunction" (shown below). Within the first two years, the feed received more than 603,000 followers. According to Tuna's owner Courtney Dasher, the dog was adopted at a local Farmer's Market where his rescuer claimed he was found on the side of a road near San Diego, California.[8] The original illustration of the anime-styled girl with pink background, blue hair, red hair bows, and green eyes is related to the Madoka Magica series. The illustration was cropped from an awkward looking futanari artwork, which was drawn by gbb for a drawing chat thread in "may" of the /b/ boards in Futaba Channel (2chan). Then he reposted it to his pixiv page on May 6th, 2012.[1] The first known use of the phrase was on 4chan's /s4s/ board thread on November 8, 2013.[2] On the same thread, a mesage with the same image featured the message "she is bury pink girl", name that later would be given to the fanart crop. While the exact origin is unknown, it is speculated the first of the emoticon was in chatrooms. The first proven use of uwu is in the Yu-Gi-Oh fanfiction Genie of the Puzzle, published by user DaakuKitsune on October 14th, 2005.[13] In the fanfiction notes before the story, the author states "Again, feel free to throw squids and fish at me. UwU I deserve it, you know" (shown below). In 2021, writer Brian Feldman noted in his newsletter BNet[16] that the usage of uwu here does not align with modern interpretations. He write, "All of this leads me to theorize that the oldest known use of uwu deploys it in a dramatically different context than the one we are now used to. Which is fine, because internet language is rarely prescriptive -- there is never one exact right way to use ambiguous pictographs like emoji and emoticons. In fact, that’s how they derive their power: allowing the reader to use the surrounding conversational context to figure out exactly what they mean.  The TV anime series for Kannagi aired 13 episodes from October to December in 2008, and the scene where Nagi was singing "Hello Soybean Song" in a karaoke box was appeared on the 10th episode "The Karaoke Warrior, Mike Takako", which was aired on December 6th.[3] This song is written in the manner of typical Japanese commercial songs, and it's also drawn as a song for an imaginary food company called "Dokkoi Foods" (どっこい食品). Bootcamp ni Ikuno Nara Mame Kue! Mame! Morimori Karada ga Tsukurareru … Souzetu na Iroke… ! Mame wa Hatake no Okuni Nari. If you are going to a bootcamp Eat beans! Beans! It builds up your body vigorously! … A fierce sex appeal… ! Beans are the mear from the field. via: Gugalyrics[4] This Karaoke box scene authentically reproduced the original manga's episode including this incoherent lyrics. The melody for this song was composed for the animation by the creator, Eri Takenashi, and arranged by Satoru Kōsaki[5], Japanese anime/game composer known for his many works as represented by "Motteke Sailor Fuku!" in Lucky Star and "Renai Circulation" in Monogatari Series.  On January 1st, 2014, Tumblr[1] user pizza-omelette posted several illustrated comic panels depicting the events leading up to an infomercial fail GIF of a man dropping a bowl of snack food (shown below). In the next five days, the post garnered upwards of 197,000 notes. On the following day, the /r/BehindTheGIFs[2] subreddit was launched for Redditors to submit humorous images explaining the stories behind animated GIFs. In the first four days, the subreddit gained over 31,000 subscribers. Erotic Edna is an image macro based on a post by redditor InverseSandwich.  On May 25th, 2008, Coachella Forums[1] member Xenocide submitted a thread titled "Coachella '09 Lineup Announced!", which highlighted a photoshopped lineup poster with the classic rock bands Led Zeppelin and The Doors headlining (shown below). The neologistic gerund "LeBroning" has been used as a catchall term to mock LeBron James' style of play since as early as 2010, with the highest rated Urban Dictionary[1] entry defining the term as a synonym for the sports idiom "choking under pressure." In the following years, James gained notoriety for flopping on many occasions during play, ultimately prompting the National Basketball Association to fine him $5,000 for violating the league’s anti-flopping policy in May 2013. The player's flopping has been also documented in a supercut compiled by Matthew Li and uploaded in June 2012. The earliest known recorded instance of "LeBroning" was uploaded by Vine user Ronnie[2] on May 30th, 2013. In the video, Ronnie is seen falling to the floor after brushing elbow with a friend walking in the opposite direction in a school hallway.  In Super Smash Bros. for 3DS, one of the stages is a train from the game Spirit Tracks from the Zelda franchise. On the stage, the character Toon Link is usually conducting the train. However, Toon Link is also a playable character in the game. In order for there not to be two Toon Links on the stage, if Toon Link is being used while playing on that stage, the character Alfonzo will conduct the train instead. Masahiro Sakurai, director of the game, showcased this in a tweet which said: It also included this picture: The original Metal Gear Solid featured a number of allies that Solid Snake, the game's protagonist, could talk to via codec. Should the player die in the game, one of the allies that Snake has contacted will futilely try to make contact with him (shown below, left), usually by a variant of "Snake? Snake!? SNAAAAAAAAAAAKE!". The sequence is considered to be unintentionally funny due to the overacting of the vocal cast, and is also used for self-parody in the form of Easter Eggs of later titles, such as Snake's own call to Colonel Roy Campbell in Super Smash Brothers. Brawl (shown below, right). To celebrate his 100K subscribers, a french minecraft youtuber named Aypierre made with his friend Azenet a special computer on their minecraft server, that was able to display all tweets with the #feedthepatrick on a screen. Then Aypierre did a live showing this and asked the viewers to tweet #feedthepatrick to check if it was working. The term "heresy" by definition refers to any belief or action that goes against common beliefs and customs present in society. A heretic is a person who has been accused of heresy. The context of the term is usually used in relation to religion.[1] However, on the internet, the word is used as a general insult. This context of the word came from the 1987 tabletop miniature war-game Warhammer 40,000. In the game, humanity has come to worship "The Emperor of Mankind" (shown below) who led the Great Crusade to restore humanity to the stars, as the one true god. In the Emperor's realm, the Church ruled over mankind.[2] Because of the leadership of the church, heresy became one of the worst possible crimes a person could commit along with blasphemy.[3] The 3D block letter style was first introduced by Brooklyn-based graphic designer Catherine Frazier[2] in October 2012, when she began sharing her collection of GIFs, including a few GIFs of 3D text objects, to her Tumblr art project TransparentGIFs.[9] Shortly afterwards, Frazier launched a separate blog entirely dedicated to the block letter GIFs at Animated Text[1], where any Tumblr user can request a phrase or expression for her to immortalize in GIF form. Since launching in November 2012, Frazier's blog has garnered more than 57,000 followers in just over a year. According to the Online Etymology Dictionary[1], the word "swag" originated sometime in the 1520s and meant "to move heavily or unsteadily." It may have been a derivative of the verb "swing", which originated from the word "sway"[2] around 1300, meaning "to go, glide, move." In modern context, "swag" may be used as a business lingo for promotional merchandise[4] but its online usage has been largely attributed to its root word "swagger," which Merriam-Webster Dictionary[13] defines as: The earliest documented use of "swagger" can be found in the text of English poet William Shakespeare's play A Midsummer Night's Dream[3] written sometime between 1590 and 1596.

This references the plot of Les Miserables with a nod to the ship between Javert and Jean Valjean. As of September 2014, the post has gained over 35,000 notes. On April 6th, 2011, the official YouTube page for Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher's non-profit foundation DNA,[2] which has been since renamed to Thorn, launched an anti-sex trafficking campaign "Real Men Don't Buy Girls" with a series of witty public service announcement videos in which dozens of Hollywood male celebrities, such as Bradley Cooper, Sean Penn and Jamie Fox, advocate breaking the barriers of gender roles and denounce soliciting sex as an unmanly thing to do. As of September 2014, the most viewed video in the series, which stars Sean Penn, has gained over 320,000 views (shown below). Along with the PSA video campaign, Kutcher also started a crowdfunding campaign[8] for their promotional efforts on Crowdrise with a goal of $5,000. As of September 2014, the campaign has raised over $7,000. On May 21st, 2013, Tumblr user sorion[2] published a text post including the "Don't Do the Thing, I'm Going to Do the Thing" formula, applying it to the Star Trek franchise. As of September 2014, the post has gained over 40,000 notes. On August 10th, 2014, Hessler uploaded a video to YouTube titled "3 Breasted Woman" in which she dances while wearing a revealing bikini (shown below). In the first two weeks, the video gained over 2.3 million views and 1,200 comments. On January 10th, 2007, YouTuber ChangeDeGuerra uploaded the "Donkey Kong Rap" taken from the opening of the 1999 Nintendo 64 platform game Donkey Kong 64. During the rap, each character from the game is introduced with several verses describing their attributes and his abilities, often starting with the word "He," including the orangutan Lanky Kong (shown below). One of the earliest mentions of Perler Art online was a question left on Answers.com[12] on November 8th, 2003, which reads: The Facebook page Tattas be like[1] was launched by Cid, allround creative at Vice, on January 3rd, 2014. According to Cid, in an interview with HP De Tijd,[2] he made the page in a flash after he saw an image on tv of a woman with an aggressive dog with the subscript "Tattas be like.. hij doet niets, aai ‘m maar" (translation: He does nothing, go pet him) and started making several variations himself which he shared over Facebook. On December 11th, 2006, YouTuber DJ Paris Paul[2] posted a video of CheckOne2 performing their song "Jam" which chorus repeatedly says "That's my jam." As of September 2014, the video has gained over 13,000 views. On March 15th, 2009, Urban Dictionary[3] user frostmans submitted and entry for man logic which defined it as: "Bruh" has been used as an alternative way of saying "bro," an informal term of address for "brother," since the mid-to-late 2000s, around the same time or shortly after the word "bro" entered colloquial usage in American-English vernacular. On December 19th, 2003, the first Urban Dictionary entry for "bruh" was submitted by LudwigVan.[1] The Instagram account DILFs of Disneyland[1] uploaded its first photo on August 19th, 2014. "DILF" is an acronym which originated as the male equivalent of "MILF", a crude yet widely used descriptor for attractive-looking mothers. Within a month, the account had gained over 100,000 followers and uploaded over 50 pictures. Its most liked photo has gained over 8,000 likes. Starbucks debuted the "Pumpkin Spice Latte"[6] in October of 2004. The following month, Starbucks sales grew 11%, which CEO Jim Donald credited to the success of the new coffee drink.[1] "The very successful debut of Pumpkin Spice Latte, which has been enthusiastically received by our customers, is creating momentum as we head into the holiday season." The earliest documented usage of the term “FAIL” can be traced to a Japanese 16-bit scrolling shooter game, "Blazing Star," which was released on February 26th, 1998.[5] The game was often mocked for its grammatically incorrect “game over” message that reads: “YOU FAIL IT! YOUR SKILL IS NOT ENOUGH- SEE YOU NEXT TIME- BYE BYE" (shown below). As seen with the All Your Base are Belong to Us meme, the combination of a retro video game narrative and Engrish translation proves itself to be a powerful source of lulz.  On April 10th, 2014, the UK-based testicular cancer prevention and support group Check One Two[3] launched the hashtag #FeelingNuts to promote the Testicular Cancer Awareness Month and encourage men to regularly check themselves for testicular cancer.[1] On September 4th, 2014, the Tumblr blog The Worst Cat[1] was created. The first post is a detailed outline of the worst cat, which explains: The blog features photos and GIFs of baby hippos, "the worst cat." The advice animal character was born during the GamerGate controversy. On October 9th, 2014, Twitter user Spacekatgal[4] posted the first instance of the image macro series Oppressed GamerGater to criticize the GamerGate community. Including the image series of a child from one of the PowerPoint template[3]. On October 5th, 2014, the Instagram account Poor Kids of Tehran[1] was created. Its first uploaded picture features a picture of a broken down refrigerator. In less than two weeks the account gained over 4,000 followers. On October 6th, 2014, UNICEF's UK Twitter account[4] introduced #WakeUpCall with an instructional message urging people to share a wake-up selfie and donate to the international organization's humanitarian efforts for the refugee children in Syria. Within 48 hours, the hashtag was tweeted out over 11,000 times. On September 17th, 2014, the NBA 2K YouTube channel uploaded a promotional video for the upcoming NBA 2K game, which showcased the game's new face scanning technology which creates a 3D model of the player's face (shown below). In the early morning on October 7th, Twitter user @Shannah221[1] tweeted a photo of a poorly-modeled NBA 2K15 character (shown below). Pumpkin carving evolved from carving potatoes and turnips in Ireland.[2] The tradition was picked up in America in the early 1800s, coinciding with the American adoption of Halloween. On October 15th, 1999, EHow[11] published a pumpkin carving guide titled "How to Carve a Pumpkin With Paper" in one of the earliest online mentions of pumpkin carvings. The awkward looking reaction of the anime character Chaika comes from the 4th episode of the anime Coffin Princess when the heroine Dominica Škoda stares and smiles at her. When one of the 4chan user asked why the fad had became popular recently and where the fad came from, another anonymous user claimed that the Futaba Channel (2chan) users have ignited the trend.[2] On December 23rd, 1966, Italian epic Spaghetti Western movie, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,[1] the film which originated the phrase, was released. One of the posters[2] used to promote the film has since become an iconic example of film advertising, and is the stylistic basis for many of the meme's derivations. On October 12th, 2008, DeviantArt [6]user DutchLion posted a Naruto themed parody, as of October 2014, the image has gained over 4,000 views. On March 26th, 2006, Flickr[1] user Maximum Mitch uploaded a photo of Tom Cruise manically laughing during a conference at the Yahoo! headquarters[7]. As of October 2014, the photo has gained over 5,000 views. On June 7th, 2011, DeviantArtist[3] CosbyDAF posted a creepypasta story titled "Normal Porn for Normal People" about a man who receives a chain letter directing him to the website NormalPornForNormalPeople.com, ostensibly dedicated "to the eradication of abnormal sexuality." After visiting the URL, the protagonist discovers several disturbing videos, including footage of a shaved chimpanzee mauling a woman to death. Everybody knows that if you surf the web long enough, you'll see some pretty sick shit. This is especially true if you intentionally dwell into the dark underbelly of the internet. I've seen quite a few things I don't care to admit to, but one thing that I'll always remember is a site called "normalpornfornormalpeople.com". The first strange thing about the site was that I didn't find it by actually looking for it. It was e-mailed to me by someone I didn't know. The e-mail was as follows: Hi there found this site is very nice thought u might like normalpornfornormalpeople.com pass it on, for the good of mankind Pretty standard issue chain letter, although the url and the last remark really piqued my curiosity. I was having a very boring day when I got this, so I made sure my anti-virus was working and then I clicked on it. It was a very average, very generic looking site. It gave the impression that the creators just BARELY gave a shit about making it look professional. The author seemed to have a very tenuous grasp on English, and on the front page was a long, boring, and incoherent rant that I don't remember or have saved. The site had a strange tagline (which even today people haven't figured out the meaning of), which was: "Normal Porn for Normal People, A Website Dedicated To The Eradication of Abnormal Sexuality" And from the sound of that, I wasn't sure whether I was here to watch porn or if I had stumbled onto some kind of eugenics program. But I was here now, and I was very, very curious to see what "Normal People" get their rocks off to. So I scrolled down through the rant and…nothing. The page didn't seem to link to anywhere else, and I was about to leave when I noticed every word of the rant was its own hyperlink. So I clicked one of them, and was sent to a white page with very long list of links in the form of: "normalpornfornormalpeople.com/(random letters)" So I stopped for a minute and asked myself if I really wanted to waste God knows how much time clicking random links that will likely give me a virus that will rape my computer. I figured I'd just try it for maybe five minutes, just to see if anything came up. I clicked one of the links, and was sent to another page. This page apparently had totally different urls than the last one. I was just about to say "Fuck this" when I clicked on the third link, and a video download came up. It was called "peanut.avi". It was a thirty-minute video of a man, a woman and a dog in a kitchen. The woman would make a peanut butter sandwich, and the man would set it down for the dog to eat. This was all that happened, for thirty minutes. It was obvious that the cameraman had to stop filming and wait until the dog was ready to eat again, and the dog seemed rather sick by the end of it. I know what you're thinking: "What the hell does that have to do with porn?" I have no clue. I've seen a little over two dozen videos from this site, and the majority had no sexual activity at all. After watching peanut.avi, I went on a certain image board I frequent to play online show and tell, like I always do with weird shit like this. But someone had already made a thread about it, some guy who had received the same chain letter I did. The image board thread got lots of people with nothing better to do to dig through the site, and that's how I saw other videos. Most of those two dozen videos were very uneventful, and consisted of people talking to the cameraman in a room with nothing in it but a desk and a few chairs. I mean literally nothing on the walls, or in terms of furniture. The whole room had a very cold, sterile feel to it. The conversations were just idle banter about previous jobs or embarrassing childhood moments. I kept expecting some kind of discussion about what the people were filming or what the site was about, but of course, nothing. You would never know these videos had anything to do with porn if you saw it out of context. I will say one thing though, the people who appeared in these videos were quite attractive. However, the other videos that actually did feature content which I suppose could be called "sexual" is where things got weird. I'll give brief descriptions of the stranger videos; if you're really eaten up with curiosity you can try to hunt them down on a torrent site. On May 26th, 2014, rapper T.I. posted a video on Instagram responding to rumors that he received two black eyes during a fight with professional boxer Floyd Mayweather two days prior, saying "where they at though?" while looking into the camera (shown below). In the next six months, the video gained over 176,000 likes and 29,000 comments. Two black what?? C'mon now. Never in da history of Nigga-dom. But nice try tho. Lol A video posted by @troubleman31 on May 5, 2014 at 5:37pm PDT "What they say I got two black eyes. Where they at though? These ones I'm looking at here?"\ The TV anime series for Masaru-san was a 10-minute program in a weekday late night variety show and aired 48 episodes between January and March in 1998. The opening credit movie is well-known among anime otakus for its hilariously dynamic anime movements inspired by the drawing style of Fujio Akatsuka[2] and many parodies/homages to other anime titles which are the works of the director for this anime Akitaro Daichi[3] or his favorite old titles such as Cyborg 009, Gutsy Frog, Ken the Wolf Boy, Star of the Giants, etc… And the theme song "Romance" was sung by a Japanese rock band PENICILLIN.[4] While the exact origin of the phrase “drop the bass” remains unknown, the drop has been used as a technical term[6] among electronic music producers since as early as the late 1990s. The earliest known usage of the phrase as the title of an electronic dance song can be attributed to German DJ Rocco's 2002 track “Drop the Bass” (shown below). On April 17th, 2013, YouTuber Battlecruiser Plays uploaded a montage parody video titled "Shrekt.wmv," which featured various images and video clips of the ogre character Shrek (shown below). On August 16, 2006, YTMND user Zeratul86 created a site containing the image and attributed it to a thread he found on 4chan [1].   The phrase is not from the movie itself, but from the novelization that screenwriter Arthur C. Clarke wrote at the same time as the screenplay. The book describes the scene in which Bowman is entering the star gate, and he says the following phrase just before losing contact with Mission Control: "The thing's hollow -- it goes on forever -- and -- oh my God! -- it's full of stars!" [1] The earliest evidence of people participating in the sexual position was in France in the 1790s.[1] Soon after the position became known, the term soixante-neuf (French for sixty-nine, hence the number) was given to it. The earliest known use appeared in Whore's Catechisms in France. The Kama Sutra refers to the position as "The Congress of a Crow." During the late 1880s, the Swiss Army decided to purchase a new folding pocket knife for their soldiers. This knife was to be suitable for use by the army in opening canned food and disassembling the Swiss service rifle. In January 1891, the knife received the official designation Modell 1890[1]. The Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) assessment is a psychometric questionnaire designed to measure psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions. The framework was developed by American psychologists Katherine Cook Briggs and Isabel Briggs Myers, based on theories proposed by renowned psychologist Carl Jung, during the World War II in the 1940s[1], with the belief a knowledge of personality preferences would help women who were entering the industrial workforce, and it was published in 1962. The earliest known resource website for the MBTI was created in 1998 under the domain personalitypage.com,[7] which remains active as of January 2015. One of the first notable online commentaries on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator can be found in a blog post by Canadian journalist and author Malcolm Gladwell on September, 2004, in which he criticized the M.B.T.I. for having "a large problem with consistency" and that its founders "did not actually understand Jung at all"[2].  On October 28th, 2014, Viner Rozay[1] posted the a video featuring a teenager yelling "You look like a mufucking uhhhhhhh" to one of his friends (shown below). Over the next two months, the video gained over 2.2 million views and 1,000 comments. The 30-second spot commercial was first released online via the official YouTube channel for EB Games Canada on December 16th, 2014 (shown below). In the video, two fans of the Call of Duty franchise race to an EB Games store to purchase the eleventh installation in the series, Advanced Warfare, which was released for PC, Xbox and Playstation in November 2014. Upon arriving at the store, the customers immediately ask for copies of Advanced Warfare, to which a store employee with a visibly lanky neck and soft-spoken voice enthusiastically responds "copy that," an affirmative expression typically used in military radio communications and frequently heard throughout the video game series. On September 18th, 2014, Getty Images photographer Oliver Douliery photographed Biden staring pensively out a window at the White House during a special summit with the Ukrainian president to address the escalating political tension between the East European nation and Russia. "US Vice-President Joe Biden looks on during a bilateral meeting between President Obama and President Petro Poroshenko of Ukraine in the Oval Office of the White House September 18, 2014 in Washington, DC. The two leaders held a bilateral meeting to discuss a strategic aid package for Ukraine for its battle with pro Russian separatists." On December 6th, 2014, Twitter user Michael Doran[2] tweeted the Getty Images photograph and invited his followers to come up with funny and fitting internal monologues for the image.  On April 27th, 2010, YouTuber LiLAH4 uploaded a clip from a nature show featuring an elephant shrew in which the narrator can be heard saying "Take a closer look at that snout!" (shown below). In five years, the video gained over 297,000 views and 200 comments. The phrase "Let Me Love You" has been used as the title of several pop songs. The first of these to become popular on an international level was an R&B song released by the American artist Mario in 2004, charting in first place in the US, New Zealand, and several countries in Europe.[1] However, the phrase didn't get widely incorporated into reaction images and GIFs until circa 2012, when it began to pick up steam in the pop culture fandom blogosphere on Tumblr, including Supernatural, The Hunger Games and The Avengers, among many others. Sonic & Knuckles is a 1994 installment of the Sonic the Hedgehog series featuring Sonic the Hedgehog and the then-newly-playable Knuckles the Echidna.[1] The game was advertised for its "Lock-On Technology," which in practice meant the physical game cartridge could be connected with other Sega Genesis games, most notably Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and Sonic the Hedgehog 3, with varying results. Combining the cartridge with Sonic the Hedgehog 3 formed a new compiled game called Sonic the Hedgehog 3 & Knuckles, which tied the stories of both games into a single saga as the developers originally intended. In addition, combining the cartridge with Sonic the Hedgehog 2 formed Knuckles the Echidna in Sonic the Hedgehog 2, a simple modification whereby the player could play through the story of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 as Knuckles. It is said that Don was created in the year 42069 on the standard Gregorian calendar, referred to henceforth as 0 A.D. (After Don). Humanity had been devastated in an intergalactic war between federations attempting to resolve the issue of who had the best memes. Internet scientist Jamie Dubs sat in his lab, trying in vain to create the world's dankest and most potent meme weapon as part of a project codenamed D.O.N., so that his homeworld would be victorious. But suddenly, the experiment went horribly wrong, and all of the memetic energy fused together into a single being. The sheer amount of power present resulted in the creation of an intelligent life-form capable of time travel. Looking around and becoming aware of the damage that memes had done to humanity, the newly formed Don realized that fate had brought him to life for a purpose: he would travel to the year 2008 and begin documenting and dissecting every meme he could find for the next forty thousand years, in the hope that there would be enough memes to quench humanity's thirst, preventing a war over meme resources in the distant future. Thus, Know Your Meme was born. The earliest known post-game interview to widely circulate on the Internet featured a rant delivered by basketball player Allen Iverson who repeated the phrase "We talking about practice" during a press conference in May 2002 (shown below).  Peppa Pig is a British children's cartoon which began airing in 2004. [1] In one episode of the show, which featured a segment where the characters discuss musical preference, Peppa begins playing "Heads, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes" on a radio in response to being asked what kind of music she likes. [2] On June 8, 2014, YouTuber Phorky Phork uploaded an edited version of this scene in which the radio plays the song "Ass-N-Titties" by DJ Assault. [3] The logo comes from Ubisoft's game Assassin's Creed (2007)[1], which is both the logo of the game itself as well as the logo of the Assassin's, the secret organization that seeks freedom and peace by murdering Templars, individuals that wish to control and oppress the population. On December 12th, 2013, an ASCII art depiction of a toucan bird was posted in an avian-themed thread on the 4chan /s4s/ (shit 4chan says) board (shown below).[5]        ▄▄▄▀▀▀▄▄███▄           ▄▀▀░░░░░░░▐░▀██▌      ▄▀░░░░▄▄███░▌▀▀░▀█   ▄█░░▄▀▀▒▒▒▒▒▄▐░░░░█▌ ▐█▀▄▀▄▄▄▄▀▀▀▀▌░░░░░▐█▄ ▌▄▄▀▀                  ▌░░░░▄███████▄                            ▐░░░░▐███████████▄                            ▐░░░░▐█████████████▄                              ▀▄░░░▐██████████████▄                                  ▀▄▄████████████████▄                                                    █▀██████▀▀▀▀█▄                                              ▄▄▀▄▀  ▀██▀▀▀▄▄▄▀█                                       ▄▀▀▀▀▀         ██▌                                                         ▄▀▄▀                                                   ▄▄██▀ The exact origin of the expression "le toucan has arrived" on Twitch is unknown. The earliest known mention was in a DOTA 2 thread on the NeoGAF forums[4] by member Randdalf, who cited "le toucan has arrived" as his "current favorite Twitch copy pasta." As early as September 2010, YouTubers were uploading montages containing footage from first-person shooter games like Call of Duty (shown below, left). On March 10th, 2011[5], YouTuber Jamal Nigrumz (also known as jmcxs) uploaded the earliest known montage parody video featuring clips from the massively multiplayer online role-playing game World of Warcraft (shown below, right). In November 2012, PhotoFunia[1] launched a page titled "Morning News," which allows the user to customize a photograph by altering the image and headline featured on the front of a newspaper laying on top of a breakfast table (shown below).[2] The page cites PhotoFunia co-founder Alexey Ivanov as the copyright holder of the original photograph. In 2009, Krys launched an advertising campaign on TV, in order to change its brand image. This campaign, created by the advertising company Agence H, is based on the sentence: Avant, j'avais/j'étais X – Mais ça c'était avant (which could be translated as: I used to have/be X – But that was before). It shows random people, who used to have a complex about some of their physical features, but who forget about their lack of self-confidence once they wear glasses. This logic is completed by a second catchphrase: Krys – Vous allez vous aimer (Krys – You are going to like yourself). In late 2010, the TV campaign was followed by a printed campaign, and, in 2011, by a similar TV and print campaign, featuring celebrities. Though it is unclear where ASCII art originated, creating images out of letters dates back to as early as the 1890s. British typewritist Flora F. Stacey created eight artworks with frames made out of symbols using her Bar Lock typewriter. In 1893, they were displayed with the machine at the Chicago World's Fair.[3] In 1898, more of her work was published in the Pitman's Phonetic Journal.[4] The misspelling of "cry" stems from a copypasta about a short teenage romance story known as 5ever, which was posted by Tumblr user Deathray-Deathray[13] on March 10th, 2011. Written in Comic Sans, the post ends with a note encouraging readers to reblog or like if they “crey.” Momiji Inubashiri first appeared as a midboss character in the tenth main series Touhou game, Mountain of Faith. [1] She is a white wolf tengu, a kind of Japanese mystic apparition analogous to the Western idea of goblins. Despite its limited appearances in the official Touhou media, Momiji proved to be a very popular character with the fanbase, ranking at #21 most favorite Touhou Project character out of 159 in a 2014 popularity contest.[2]  The backstory behind the creation of GiantDad is little known, but many early adopters[8][9] of the character have credited professional video gamer OnlyAfro for custom-designing the character build. The earliest known illustration of the character was uploaded to DeviantArt[7]by user MenasLG on April 8th, 2012, showing a GiantDad character getting his hands cut off by an enemy (shown below). The character build is distinguished by the following equipments and items: Mask of the Father, Giant Armor, Giant Gauntlets, Giant Leggings, Ring of Favor and Protection and Havel’s Ring. The troll quote stems from the transcript of Miyazaki's interview with the Japanese news site Golden Times[2], published on January 27th, 2014. During the interview, Miyazaki expressed skepticism regarding the current state of anime as an art form and a cultural industry, particularly how little the new generation of animators are seeking inspiration from actually observing human behaviors and interactions in real life. On January 30th, a translation of the original interview was provided by English-language Japanese news site RocketNews24.[1] On November 27th, 2005, Something Awful user CrumFUNist submitted a thread titled "Lego_Robot sucks ass,"[9] which criticized forum user Lego_Robot (webcomic artist Bob Averill) for creating poor MSPaint comics and trolling the forums. Over the next two years, the thread gained over 1,500 responses. In May 2007, Averill posted a comic titled "This one's not funny" on the website Lego Robot Comics (now named PlasticBrickAutomaton),[1] which depicts an overweight Something Awful user mocking Lego_Robot in a discussion thread before closing his window when distracted by two women playing volleyball outside (shown below).[11] On February 7th, 1996, the earliest known example of a furry scale was posted in a document titled "The Code of the Furries",[1] which contained a rating system for where people "fall on the human-to-animal scale": On May 3rd, 2007, an entry[5] for the phrase was submitted to Urban Dictionary, defining it as: [a] phrase to describe someone who thinks he/she has a lot of clams, and is therefore exceptionally witty, jaunty, and/or extravagant One of the earliest and most widely used base photographs for the reaction image series originates from a scene in the 1992 American comedy film Wayne's World[4], wherein the titular character Wayne Campbell looks directly at the camera while gesturing his thumb towards his friend Garth Algar in a fit of laughter and the subtitle reads "Get-A-Load-of-This-Guy."  The exact origin of the term "cultural appropriation" is unknown, although the concept appears to have been predominately used in academic circles in sociology and anthropology prior to the Internet. On September 9th, 2003, the book Everything But the Burden: What White People Are Taking from Black Culture[9] by Greg Tate was released. On November 12th, 2004, the pop song "Harajuku Girls" by Gwen Stefani was released with her debut album Love. Angel. Music. Baby. (shown below). On October 31st, 2005, comedian Margaret Cho published a blog post expressing misgivings with the song for promoting racial stereotypes. On June 8th, 2005, the book Who Owns Culture?: Appropriation and Authenticity in American Law[1] by American lawyer Susan Scafidi was released. In May 2006, the annual feminist science fiction convention WisCon held a panel on cultural appropriation. The panel was subsequently met with criticism online, with several Livejournal users creating lengthy posts about the subject.[4][5][6][7][8] In 2003, artist Jeph Jacques launched the webcomic series "Questionable Content," which follows the life of protagonist Marten Reed.[1] In 2012, the pre-operative transgender woman Claire Augustus was added to the cast, who subsequently became Reed's girlfriend in the comic.[2] On February 5th, 2015, Jacques published a page in which Augustus undresses herself in front of Reed, presumably exposing her male genitalia (shown below). The earliest known instance of matching icons was uploaded by Tumblr user Dodocity on September 7th, 2012. The post featured two symmetrically inverted images of Peter Parker from Spider-Man. Although the actual origin of the term "fat logic" is unclear, the earliest known instance of the term is found to be with the creation of the reddit subreddit /r/fatlogic in April 2013[1]. On August 30th, 2006, Newgrounds Forums[7] member Ginogino13 replied to a post containing a poorly compressed sprite image with the phrase "Hmm… needs more JPEG" (shown below). From October 9th, 2005 to December 22nd, 2009, the animated series Little Einsteins was broadcast on the Disney Junior television network. The series featured the characters Leo, Annie, June and Quincy, who went on various educational adventures, in a similar vein to the Magic School Bus and Dora the Explorer children's shows. On January 18th, 2014, YouTuber 886Beatz uploaded a trap remix of the Little Einsteins theme song to YouTube, where it received more than 5.3 million views and 3,400 comments over the next month. On February 18th, 2015, Viner Nike Boi[3] uploaded a clip from the music video "I Don't Like ft.

One of the earliest weather forecast fails was uploaded to eBaum's World on February 26th, 2008, in the style of a Demotivational Poster. The photo they used, which was probably found elsewhere online, features an image screen captured from the weather broadcast of WBNS-10TV, in Columbus Ohio, where the weatherman appears to be gesturing towards a storm which coincidentally looks like a penis]  Gjallarhorn was first introduced as a playable weapon in Bungie's first-person-shooter game Destiny released on September 9th, 2014.

The first online examples, including some GIFS with the tag and a Yahoo answers post, seem to appear in November 2013.[1] At that point, the only social media platforms that allowed direct messaging were Twitter and Facebook; Instagram introduced direct messaging in December of 2013,[2] and Vine premiered the feature in April of 2014.[3] One of the first popular examples of the term was this hip hop single by M-Boy titled "Slide Into Your DMs," which was released on January 8th, 2014. The video has over 23,000 views as of July 2015.  The Squid Sisters first appeared in the video game Splatoon upon its original release in May 2015.

In the papyrus, two vignettes are included which are believed to represent Medjed, depicting a figure hidden underneath what appears to be a sheet (shown below). In 2012, the British Museum held an exhibit at the Mori Arts Center Gallery in Tokyo, Japan where the Greenfield papyrus was put on display. Visitors to the museum noted Medjed's strange appearance, claiming he resembled a type of mascot character.[2][3]  There are multiple theories explaining the etymology of the word "fag" in the derogatory sense, though most explanations remain unsubstantiated. According to Wikipedia's description[1] on its history, the word meaning "bundle of sticks" is ultimately derived from the Vulgar Latin "fascis." Also during the 16th century, the word "faggot" began being used as a derogatory term for old women, and this may have led to it being used as a reference to homosexuals. The colloquial usage of "fag" as a homophobic slur is American in origin but it has spread to other English-speaking countries because of its popular appearance in mass media. In Britain, the term "fag" is more commonly used as slang for cigarette, while its usage as verb "fagging"[2] refers to the traditional British custom of junior students serving as personal servants to senior, older students, which has been established in the 1600s. Similar to modern feminists' embracing and re-appropriation of female derogatory terms like "bitch", LBGT communities have made efforts to reclaim homophobic slurs like "gay", "queer", "dyke" and to a lesser extent, "fag" since the 1970s. The slang "fag hag," which refers to a heterosexual woman extensively associated with gay men, has been documented in The Queen's Vernacular: A Gay Lexicon (1972)[3]: In addition, Larry Kramer's 1978 novel Faggots[4] discusses the use of the word within and towards the gay community in the 1970s New York. In the 1990s, prominent LGBT organizations like Queer Nation also sought to re-appropriate the homophobic slur by incorporating them into the LGBT activist language, best known for protest banners like "Dykes and Fags Bash Back!" and ""Strike a Pose, Not a Fag." However, it should be noted that its use as an empowering term is always context-dependent. On December 27th, 2014, Tumblr[1] user aaaaa42c posted a comic in which a small dog informs a boy that he produces multiple cancerous cells every day, with each having the potential to be fatal (shown below). Within nine months, the comic gained over 17,100 notes. Sometime on September 1st, 2015, Turkish Twitter users began tweeting the hash tag #KiyiyaVuranInsanlik, along with a photo of the three year-old Syrian boy named Aylan Kurdi, who died overnight on September 1st by drowning during his family's failed attempt at a night passage from Turkey to Greece. In the photo, Kurdi is face-down in the sand on the beaches of a town called Bodrum, in Turkey. Later reports said that Kurdi's family was attempting to eventually find their way to Canada. Kurdi's his five-year-old brother, Galip, and mother, Rehan also died; their father, Abdullah, survived.[4] According to the Online Etymology Dictionary,[1] the term "retard" originally comes from the French word "retarder," meaning to restrain or "make slow." As early as 1970, "retard" became a slang term for "retarded person" in American English. Starting in October 2014, users on the /r9k/ (robot9000) board on 4chan began referring to original illustrations and photoshops of Pepe the Frog as "Rare Pepes"; sharing the "rare" images of Pepe as if they were trading cards, some of which were posted with watermarks to retain their value (shown below).  From September 1961 to April 1962, the animated series Top Cat was produced by Hanna-Barbera studios and broadcast on the ABC network. The show centered around a gang of anthropomorphic New York City alley cats, including the titular Top Cat, Fancy-Fancy, Spook, Benny the Ball, Brain and Choo-Choo. In the show, the character Choo-Choo is depicted as naive member of the group who often exhibits signs of neuroticism and anxiety. On April 25th, 2011, a page for Choo-Choo was created on the Top Cat Wiki.[6] On August 29th, 2015, Viner[9] Nicholas Fraser uploaded a short clip titled "That one person that's sways lying on what they own"[1], featuring himself listening to another person telling a lie. The clip then cut to Fraser, dancing in a backyard while singing "Why the f*ck you lyin'?" to the tune of 1997 single "Too Close" from American R&B band Next. Fraser also uploaded the clip simultaneously to his YouTube, Instagram, and Twitter accounts.[3] That day, the video was reposted to YouTube, where it gained over 3.5 million views and 2,100 comments over the next two years. On September 12th, 2015, the FBS football season match[2] between Virginia Cavaliers (University of Virginia) and Notre Dame Fighting Irish (University of Notre Dame) kicked off at Scott Stadium in Scottsville, Virginia. While most college football fans and experts anticipated an easy win for Notre Dame, Virginia Cavaliers outperformed the expectation of many by securing a one-point lead with less than two minutes remaining in the last quarter. However, Notre Dame's backup quarterback DeShone Kizer managed to flip the lead and ultimately seal the victory with a 39-yard touchdown pass with 12 seconds remaining in the game. Immediately after Notre Dame's game-winning touchdown, ESPN turned the camera to a Cavaliers supporter in the seating area heavily slouched over the brick wall in dismay. Following the broadcast, a screenshot of the fan's reaction entered circulation on Twitter after the image was near-simultaneously tweeted by sports columnists Timothy Burke[15] and Erik Malinowski[16] at 5:01 p.m. (EST). On September 15th, 2015, the Vsauce YouTube channel uploaded an explanatory video on the statistical phenomenon known as Zipf’s law (shown below), in which the host Michael Stevens briefly mentions the word “quizzaciously” as a notable example of a hapax legomenon in the English language, since it only appears once in Google Search results[8] despite its inclusion in the Oxford English Dictionary. On July 25th, 2011, writer Kelly Williams Brown created her first post on her Tumblr, adultingblog.[1] The blog provided a selection of lifestyle tips in a conversational style, meant to help people act like adults. The blog was formatted as a series, and the first post was titled "Step One: Make your fucking bed." It has received 47 notes as of September 2015. "Nuclear" is the eleventh track featured in Mike Oldfield's[1] studio album Man on the Rocks,[2] released on March 3rd, 2014.

After the clock's alarm went off during English class. Mohamed was sent to the school's office where he was arrested by several police officers for "possession of a hoax bomb." That evening, Twitter user Amneh Jafari posted a tweet[5] speculating that Mohamed would've been "labeled as a genius" if he had a different name along with the hashtags "#doublestandards" and "#IStandWithAhmed" (shown below). In the next 72 hours, the tweet gained over 1,000 retweets and 690 favorites.  In the United States, police officers cannot detain citizens unless they are being investigated for a crime. Online, many sources advise citizens to ask "am I free to go?" or "am I being detained?" during interactions with the police to determine if the detention is voluntary. On September 10th, 2012, YouTuber Christina Gonzalez uploaded a video titled "Am I Being Detained," featuring footage of a man being held for questioning by police officers at a subway station in New York City (shown below). On June 7th, 2014, Imgur[1] user balcsida uploaded an animated GIF of a file titled "This image" being dragged into a folder titled "Fapping material" (shown below).

Airing March 9, 2015, it was Disney XD's most watched series broadcast ever with just over 2 million viewers [1]. The climax in question involves Grunkle Stan's mysterious giant portal about to go off. His great niece Mabel Pines, despite her twin brother Dipper's demands to shut it down, trusts her great uncle and allows the machine to activate, risking the fate of the universe. After a long, bright flash and a gravitational anomaly, a man walks out of the portal. Dipper says, "What? Who is that?" to which Grunkle Stan replies, "the author of the journals, my brother" as the twin reveals his face. That night, YouTube user TheNextBigThing uploaded a clip of the scene (quote starting at 2:11) which received upwards of 900,000 views as of September 27, 2015. The meme gained traction in late June, 2015. Tumblr user mermandos posted about a dream in which Dipper walks into the Shack kitchen to the smell of delicious pancakes. When he asks who's making them, Stan responds in exactly the fashion seen in "Not What He Seems", revealing his brother Ford in a chef's hat [2]. Mermandos' post was reblogged by phantomrose96, who suggested that this may be a recurring theme in the Pines househould, inventing three more situations that fit the structure of a mundane question being answered by Stan in the same fashion [3]. This post has gained more than 15,000 notes in circulation. On September 28th, 2015, Joaquin was classified as a tropical depression southwest of Bermuda.

The song "Unbelievable – I so stunned like vegetable" was sung by Chen Tianwen and its music video produced and released under Singapore's MediaCorp Channel 5 on YouTube in order to promote the second season of "Spouse For House". Tianwen's look for the video was inspired by 70s Singaporean singer Huang Qing Yuan while the video's visuals was fashioned after Chinese karaoke music videos [1]. The song and its music video was released by MediaCorp Channel 5 on April 14, 2015 through YouTube. Upon the release of the music video, the video garnered popularity inside Singapore and began attracting international attention after journalism websites TIME [2] and Huffington Post [3] ran articles about the song and its video two days after its release. "Tweek X Craig" was a 2015 episode of South Park that premiered on October 28th. The episode parodies slash fiction genre of yaoi art which is about forbidden love and the LGBT lifestyle.

On November 9th, 2015, the French Agence France-Presse (AFP) tweeted several photos of a man in his underwear attacking activists from the Bird Protection League at a cornfield in Audon, France (shown below).[1][2][3] According to the AFP,[6] a man came out of his house and began beating reporters and activists with a large shovel after seeing them destroy traps set for finches.  The exact origin of the pun is unknown, however it is likely to have started sometime after the localization and dubbing of Dragon Ball Z in English speaking countries. The phrase likely took of online following the airing of Dragon Ball Z on the Cartoon Network programming block known as Toonami. On November 10th, 2015, the open world action role-playing game Fallout 4 was released, in which the player controls a customized character in a post-apocalyptic Boston, Massachusetts 200 years after a nuclear war. During the game's introduction sequence, the player can customize their appearance using a freeform editor system to sculpt their character's facial features (shown below). The exact origin of the thought experiment is unknown. The idea of traveling back in time to kill Adolf Hitler is a trope[1] used in science fiction and is commonly associated with the proposed grandfather paradox.[2] Additionally, the dilemma bears many similarities to the "trolley problem"[4] ethical thought experiment, which asks participants if they would kill one person to save five others. In 1996, the novel Making History[6] by Stephen Fry was released, in which the protagonist travels back in time to deliver a permanent contraceptive pill to Hitler's father. On October 2nd, 2002, Season 1 Episode 5 "Cradle of Darkness" of the science fiction television series The Twilight Zone was broadcast, in which a woman travels back in time to kill Adolf Hitler as a baby (shown below). The earliest known mention of killing Hitler as an infant online was posted in the Free Republic Forums[5] by user DaveLoneRanger on April 18th, 2006, asking readers "Would you kill baby Hitler to prevent the extermination of millions?"  "Temmie Village" is the 43rd and "Tem Shop" is the 44th track in the official soundtrack of Undertale. These can be heard whenever the player enters the Temmie Village and its "Tem Shop". The village is entirely populated by monsters called "Temmies" who are known for their odd appearance and use of poor grammar. While it is currently unknown who made the first cover of the song, one of the earliest known covers is "undertale temmie get money for colege" by SoundCloud user archdiggle, which is a mashup with the single "Whales" by Hail Mary Mallon.[3] "New York" is the nickname of Tiffany Pollard, a contestant in both the first and second seasons of the 2006-2007 VH1 reality television show Flavor of Love.[1] The show was a matchmaking show featuring the eccentric rapper Flava Flav, and was well-known for the humorousness of the settings and outrageousness of the characters. New York, who was one of the most outspoken and controversial characters, was later featured in several spinoff series because of her immense popularity.[2] This freeze-frame most likely came from the first season of Flava of Love. In April 2014, the webcomic Extra Fabulous Comics[1] posted a comic titled "Probably Not How it Works," in which a mother warns her son to look away from two men kissing before he is magically transformed into a sweater vest, tie and pair of heart-shaped sunglasses (shown below). On November 22nd, 2015, Ivor Noyek, an Irish-born Brooklyn resident and senior art director of New York-based creative marketing agency Roar Groupe, changed his Facebook[1] profile to a photograph of himself walking down the side of a road in Katerskill Falls, New York while dressed in a jean jacket and sunglasses (shown below, left). The following day, his friend Keith Lawler replied to the post with an edited version of the photo made to look like a poster for a fake Werner Herzog film titled “Street Sailor” (shown below, right).[3]    On Monday, November 30th, Pope Francis toured Bangui, which is the capital of the Central African Republic, where he urged the people to reconcile a long-held civil war.

With the release of the anime series in 2015, the ending title cards shown never before seen subspecies of monster girls.[5] On /a/, people started a fanfiction where the secondary character Bicycle Cop[6] was paired with the most dangerous subspecies and had to fight for his life everyday.[2][1] On September 22nd, 2015, some artist uploaded to 4chan a comic featuring Bike Cop with a Shark Mermaid and a Black Slime (shown bellow).[3] The newspaper headline was originally introduced as a sight gag in a scene from "The Old Man and the Key,"[1] Episode 13, Season 13 of the American animated sitcom The Simpsons originally aired on March 10th, 2002. In the episode, Abe, the father of the protagonist character Homer Simpson, pays a visit to the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to get his driver's license issued and convinces his co-in-law Patty Bouvier to use a photograph of him that was once featured in a local newspaper in lieu of an official license photograph on the spot. Upon obtaining his newly issued driver's license, Abe walks over to a window and yells "who's laughing now?" at a cloud while holding the card in his hand. The first known wordplay on Abe Simpson's image can be traced to a humorous commentary on cloud computing technology posted by mobile tech blogger Joey deVilla[10] on September 30th, 2008. On September 16th, 2015, the South Park episode "Stunning and Brave" was broadcast, which introduced the character PC Principal and his fraternity house of social justice warrior brothers. Throughout the show's 19th season, members of the fraternity often pose the question "You PC bro?", when determining someone's commitment to social justice. The following day, YouTuber SocialJustice 123 uploaded a clip from the South Park episode in which a group of PC fraternity brothers sing a chant about social justice (shown below). The Tumblr blog was launched by Indianapolis-based designer and photographer Austin Radcliffe on April 3rd, 2010. According to Radcliffe, he began the photo blog as a way to satisfy his own penchant for the art of object arrangement, as well as to curate other artists' illustrations and photographs that exemplify visual organization and symmetrical composition.  The image's true origin is unknown, but the first recorded posting was by the Instagram user esteyban, who later deleted the post. While the mathematics is attributed to "Philipe Andolini," the identity of that person is unknown. Esteyban later reinstated the meme with a 50% opacity over an image of Steve Harvey, as a reference to the actor's "Miss Universe" gaffe, with the text (sic throughout): "I'm willing to live with my mistakes. I guess me and Steve @iamsteveharveytv have something in common. Lol We both can donate $4.33 to help the cause of #poverty and #homelessness. Sometime is takes a little humility and humor to start a conversation about an improtant topic. God bless and good luck to everyone on the next #powerball drawing. #oops #lottery #lotto #mvmntbk." On January 10th, 2016, American actor and comedian Jamie Foxx made an onstage appearance at the 2016 Golden Globes ceremony to present the Best Original Score award, alongside his co-presenter English actress Lily James of Downton Abbey. As they began unsealing the envelope to name the winner, Foxx intentionally announced Straight Outta Compton as the recipeint of the award, shortly before retracting his statement with an apology as a playful roast of the gaffe originally made by Steve Harvey at the 2015 Miss Universe pageant (shown below). "I'm sorry, folks. I've made a mistake. It's right here on the card. I take full responsibility." The camera then quickly switched its angle to capture the reactions of several celebrity guests in the audience, including Denzel Washington, who initially grinned at Foxx's shout-out to his goatee beard, though his smile quickly faded as the joke took an unexpected turn at the expense of Steve Harvey's now-notorious faux pas (shown below). On January 10th, 2016, Oklahoma's local news station KOTV[1] reported on a fire that broke out overnight at the Casa Linda Apartment complex in Tulsa, Oklahoma,[1] which resulted in an emergency evacuation of the building that is expected to leave more than 100 residents without power or heat for several days. According to the local officials and news reports, the fire burned the storage unit that houses the electrical panels and serves the entire building. Despite having to take refuge at a Red Cross shelter at a nearby church, KOTV reported that the general mood of the residents was cheerful and optimistic; among them were Michelle Dobyne, a mother of three children and resident in the complex, who offered a highly energetic eyewitness account in an interview with the news station's photojournalist Ethan Pierce: "My friend came to the door she said, well, I was on the phone cooking me and my baby some breakfast, and she say, 'Hey, something wrong, it's poppin!'. I said 'What!' She said 'Yeah,' I said 'Nah!' So the girl come down stairs. She come out of her apartment with her baby with no shoes on. I said, 'Ah, girl, it's cold outside!' She said, 'Something ain't right!' I said, 'Aw, man!' She said, 'Aw, man, the building is on fire!' I said, 'Nah, what?' I grabbed my three kids, and we bounced out. Uh, uh. We ain't gonna be in no fire! Not today!" That same day, KOTV reporter and sports anchor Charlie Hannema uploaded a video clip of the interview to his Facebook page[16], where it accumulated nearly 16 million views and more than 413,000 shares within the first 24 hours. The earliest use of the phrase comes from a 4chan's international board /int/ thread submitted on July 13th, 2015, where an Indian user complained about the "India smells bad and is dirty" jokes, claiming that people only defecate on "designated shitting streets" and not everywhere.[9] That statement was consequently mocked in the thread and several compilations of reactions from users were made. The earliest archived use of the phrase can be found on a post from the politically incorrect board /pol/ from July 22nd, 2015.[1] On May 12th, 2015, the DJKhaledVEVO YouTube channel uploaded the music video for Khaled's track "How Many Times" featuring Chris Brown, Lil Wayne and Big Sean. In the beginning of the video, Khaled orders a woman to give him a kiss, and requests several more by saying "another one" three times (shown below). In eight months, the video gained over 30 million views and 15,200 comments. "White Cis Male" can be seen as a label derived from Cisgender (often shortened as Cis), a sociological neologism coined by German sexologist Volkmar Sigusch in his 1991 article "Transsexuals and Our Nosomorphic View" to describe an individual whose gender and personal identity matches the sex he or she was assigned at birth (in contrast to someone who identifies as transgender). During the 1990s and 2000s, the term Cisgender continued to appear in academic papers on gender relations and transphobia, including Peggy McIntosh's 1998 article "White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack."[2] Online, the term rose to prominence through its widespread usage by social justice bloggers and LGBTQ activists to combat transphobia on Tumblr in the early 2010s. In 1985, the Chicago Bears football team released a music video for their rap song "Super Bowl Shuffle," in which various players rhyme about their future game wins and athletic prowess (shown below). That year, the song won a Grammy Award for Best Rhythm and Blues Performance. Over the next several years, other sports teams released imitations and parodies of the song, including the Kansas Wesleyan football team, the Boston College Men's Ice Hockey team and the Houston Rockets basketball team.[2] Black Desert Online is a Korean sandbox MMORPG developed by Pearl Abyss, which was released in early 2016 on United States and Europe.[1] One of the most praised features of the game was the character creation tool, which contained several customising options. On August 13th, 2014, an image macro with a downward pointing arrow and the caption "This poster is a skeleton / Do not trust what he says" was submitted in a thread on 4chan (shown below).  The original image (seen above) was originally posted by Tumblr user ouaka[1] on October 13th, 2013[2]. It has since been deleted[2]. Surviving blogs record the image gathering over 92,000 notes on Tumblr.[3] The gif originated from the video DUMBASS GETS PEWDIEPIE TATTOO, from the Filthy Frank channel. In the video, iDubbbz, Frank, and another YouTuber, MaxMoeFoe, force a friend, MonkRage (aka anything4views), to get a PewDiePie tattoo because they drank tequila and made a bet. The clip starts at 1:53 "Whales" was originally included as a part of Hail Mary Mallon's 2014 album Bestiary.[1] The rap alternates between two rappers (Aesop Rock and Rob Sonic) describing what they do to make astronomical amounts of money and how they spend it.[2] The song explicitly satirizes the idea of rappers having access to all the money they claim to possess; both Aesop Rock and Rob Sonic are both portrayed as vagrants in the music video. As of February 1st, 2016, the music video has over 520,000 views on YouTube. The song comes from the group as a song from their album † (also known as Cross). It was the second of five singles being used to promote the album. The song was released as a single on April 23rd, 2007, followed by its accompanying music video[1] and the official music was uploaded to Youtube on February 4th 2011 on the official Youtube Account for the duo, which as of January 2016, has over 15 million views. The song was nominated for various awards and has won the duo a "Best Video" award at the MTV Europe Music Awards in 2007[2]. Bee Movie is a computer animated movie co-written and co-produced by comedian Jerry Seinfeld, and released in November 2007, featuring the exploits of the bee Barry B. Benson in the human world. Following the release of the film, the online screenplay database Script-O-Rama uploaded the full-length script of the movie, which would become adopted as the most frequently used version in the copypasta.[3]  The phrase was used in the season one Spongebob Episode "Opposite Day". [1] Squidward attempts to sell his house, but fears that his neighbor Spongebob will make his house unsellable, saying quote "Whatever a good neighbor would do, he does the opposite!". Squidward then gets the idea to Tell Spongebob that it is opposite day, in hopes to make him behave better. Spongebob tells his friend Patrick and eventually they both that they must act like Squidwad to be the opposite o themselves. While Squidward is busy, the real estate agent arrives and Spongebob (and later Patrick) give her a tour of the house, telling the opposite of all the good qualities of the house. The real squidward comes in and tries to explain, but Patty loses it when she hears that his name is squidward, saying "HE'S SQUIDWARD, HE'S SQUIDWARD, YOU'RE SQUIDWARD?! I'M SQUIDWARD! Are there any other Squidwards I should know about?" The earliest known proposal of the term "handegg" (a portmanteau of hand and egg) as an alternative name for gridiron football can be found in a letter sent to the editor of the New York Times by an anonymous reader in 1909 (shown below). Online, the term "handegg" saw its first notable resurgence in February 2009 after an image macro of the "Learn the Difference…" meme highlighting the semantic dissonance in the word "football" as used by North Americans, in contrast to the rest of the English-speaking world, surfaced on 4chan's /b/ (random) board. That same day, the image macro was posted to Reddit's /r/pics, where it garnered a total of 706 points prior to its archival. On February 26th, 2014, the earliest known iteration of the image macro was submitted to a thread on 4chan's /co/ (comics and cartoons) board (shown below, left).[1] The image macro features an illustration of the villain Lex Luthor from the 1976 Superman vs. The Amazing Spider-Man treasury book (shown below, right).[6] The term "Berniebro," which is a portmanteau of "Bernie" and Bro, was coined by The Atlantic staff writer Robinson Meyer[1] in an article published on October 17th, 2015. Titled “Here Comes the Berniebro,” the article lists a series of stereotypical attributes and behaviors associated with an annoyingly fanatical male supporter of Bernie Sanders on Facebook. "The Berniebro is not every Bernie Sanders supporter. Sanders’s support skews young, but not particularly male. The Berniebro is male, though. Very male." "The Berniebro might get into big performative arguments about how feminism saved his life. Or, the Berniebro might always seem like he’s going to say that we need economic equality for all genders but doesn’t actually say it, because he knows that it wouldn’t go over well." "The Berniebro is someone you may only have encountered if you’re somewhat similar to him: white; well-educated; middle-class (or, delicately, “upper middle-class”); and aware of NPR podcasts and jangly bearded bands." According to books on the history of Japanese sports,[1] buruma were introduced in Japan as women's clothing for physical education in 1903. Initially introduced for ease of movement, the PE outfit changed its appearance several times throughout the 20th century.[2] The final change in appearance occured in the mid-1960s; resulting in the pittari (tight-fitting) buruma, which were a drastic minimazation from previous versions (shown below). This lead to the pittari buruma having the drawback of not always covering underwear. However, concerns over this were borne largely in silence until the early 1990s, when schools and individuals began to choose sports shorts instead due to the exponentially increasing modesty concerns; resulting in a rapid decrease in buruma use in the following decade. Nowadays, the usage of buruma as a required PE uniform in Japan has mostly disappeared. The trigger of this illustration meme was a joke photo of a boy getting a lot of Valentine's presents from his classmates in an all-boys high school, which was posted to Twitter by a user @naoyaynyn on February 14th, 2013.[1] As Valentine's Day in Japan and several East Asian countries is marketed as a commercial-driven event of women gifting men chocolates or candies as a sign of affection, this photo at all-boys school was received quite funny on the social web. On February 15th, 2016, Twitter user joshholzz, whose real name is Josh Holz, tweeted the original "Damn Daniel" video.[1] It received more than 16,000 likes in the first 48 hours, according to Mashable;[2] four days after the initial tweet it had 121,938 retweets and 148,382 likes. In it. the narrator can be repeatedly heard praising fellow student Daniel Lara's look, including his "White Vans." According to the Twitter account, both boys attend Riverside Poly High School in Riverside, California.[3] Damn Daniel pic.twitter.com/Va10hmpePO The first usage of the question was in Pokemon Crystal in 2001, in which Professor Elm asked the question. Professor Oak didn’t ask the question until the release of Pokemon Firered and Leafgreen in 2004. While various jokes (see Related Memes, below) regarding Palpatine were prevalent online for years prior to Tarkin's release, the term "Sheev Posting" was not employed to describe them until the October 14th, 2014 revelation of Palpatine's first name by an editor on the Wookipedia article titled "Darth Sidious."[2] Following this, various forums and image boards began to give their thoughts on the name. Cinemablend called the name "weird" on an article with more than 39 discussion comments,[3] while the science fiction criticism site Tor wrote at length about its possible origins:[4] On May 19th, 1999, the first Star Wars prequel, Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace opened worldwide. One of the most anticipated films of all time, the film became an immediate source of debate and criticism, resulting in more than $1 billion at the box office[1] but a 55% on Rotten Tomatoes.[2] The amount of conversation about the movie made an instant source of online jokes, particularly regarding the character of Jar Jar Binks. However, the one of the earliest (if not the first) prequel meme is Darth Vader's Noooooooooooo! from Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith. On May 20th, 2005, the YTMND user Redily[7] created the YTMND “NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!”[8] which depicted a still from the newly released Star Wars Episode III, along with the sound byte of Darth Vader saying the phrase ‘Nooooo!’ Four years later, in December 2009, Red Letter Media released their infamous 70-minute review of The Phantom Menace. The video has since received more than 7.7 million views on YouTube. The produciton company has gone on to produce reviews of the other two prequels as well.  On November 30th, 2010, Newgrounds Forums user Drony submitted a thread invited viewers to photoshop two different "Breaking News" templates, featuring a CNN news slate (shown below, left) and an unknown female news anchor (shown below, right). Although originally broadcast in Japan on 30th December 2000, the English dub which contains the line was not released until a year later, direct-to-DVD on 5th December 2001.[1] On 1st March 2010, a YouTube user uploaded a clip of the line, which has received over 7 million views in that time.[2]   On February 28, 2016, Youtuber Sr. Pelo uploaded the video "Underpants – True Ending (SPOILERS)" and it garnered 1.6 million views in less than 4 weeks. The skit contained the scene, and several have spammed "DON'T TOUCH THE CHILD" in the comments section of the video. The clip originates from a scene in the movie Spy Kids 3, in which Dinky Winks, an owner of a theme park in the movies Spy Kids 1 and 2, comes to help the other characters defeat robots. A video of the clip gained over 50,000 views. On January 16th, 1998, writer and Abilene Reporter News journalist Brian Bethel wrote a lenghty post[1] in the alt.folklore.ghost-stories Usenet newsgroup (archived 6/11/2001) recounting a strange event that happened to him two years prior, in which he claimed to have met two black-eyed boys asking him to let them into his car in a parking lot in front of a theater in Abilene, Texas. On November 14th, 1998, Bethel came back to the mailing list to add IRC chat logs with a friend of his reporting a similar encounter with two boys and a girl in Portland, Oregon that year. Three years later, on June 14th, 2001, a user by the handle Harvestwind replied to the post by sharing another similar story happening in Portland in 2000.

Writing inside the hand as a method of cheating on tests and during speeches is a well-known television trope. A Wikihow titled "How to Cheat on Your Test Using Body Parts" describes a variety of different methods for accomplishing this task in real life.[1] One notable instance of reading smudged handwriting on the hand, and therefore accidentally replacing a word with a homophone, is from episode 304 of Hey Arnold, "Helga vs. Big Patty," in which Helga replaces the word "feelings" with "felines" after reading the latter off of her sweaty palm.[2] (Scene begins at 14:20 below.) The use of the trope as a literary device in microblogging began in 2015. According to the Meme Documentation blog, the first use of the phrase was by user walmart-dot-com, who used it in a now-deleted post in January. The post has received more than 105,000 notes as of March 2016. Memedocumentation defined the format of the meme as such: More recently, some posts drop the "on hand" part of the phrase.

On April 5th 2016, Twitter user @haiyore_audio[2] uploaded several pictures of the characters taken from the textbook of his younger brother; who began his first year as a junior high school student earlier that month. Within the first 24 hours, the tweet garnered over 50,000 retweets and 45,000 likes, with many expressing affection for the charming character unexpectedly found in an educational textbook. This edition's illustrations were drawn by Japanese illustrator Denchubou (電柱棒), who also worked on a NEW HORIZON version for adults; which was released in 2011 (shown below, left). The illustrations came as a surprise to many due to the fact that they imagined typical illustrations for English textbooks would be similar to the ones from the previous edition of NEW HORIZON (shown below, right).  According to an article on Slate, the first references to Irish slavery in the American colonies emerged in the 18th century as "Souther pro-slavery propaganda against the industrialized North."

As the riot police officers of the CRS began advancing towards the crowd to disperse the demonstration, which included use of canned tear gas, a female customer at a nearby café approached the police force and confronted them for using excessive force. The woman's verbal protest was promptly cut short by a violent kick from one of the riot police officers; the incident was filmed on camera by a BMFTV camera crew and the footage was uploaded to YouTube (shown below). In addition to the video footage, the precise moment at which the riot police officer raised one of his legs was also captured on camera by French freelance photojournalist Jan Schmidt-Whitley, who promptly uploaded the image to his Facebook page[1], along with a backstory describing the circumstances leading up to the incident (shown below). Schmidt-Whitley's Facebook photograph was shared over 3,000 times in the following 72 hours.

In September 2015, Microsoft began automatically downloading Windows 10 installation files on computers running Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 operating systems, regardless of whether the user requested an upgrade. After many criticized Microsoft for the forced downloads, the company defended themselves by arguing that pre-loading upgrades was "an industry practice that reduces time for installation and ensures device readiness."[2] In December, a new prompt began appearing on Windows systems giving the option to "Upgrade now" or "Upgrade tonight," with no clear opt-out button (shown below).[7]  On March 8th, 2016, Tumblr[4] user defense-of-the-gathering posted an image purportedly offering instructions to make "Bernie Sanders Glowsticks," along with a warning that it would "release chlorine gas which can kill you" (shown below). The image falsely advises readers to combine alcohol and chlorine tablets in plastic bottles to make a glowing liquid, which would actually cause an explosive reaction when mixed together.

In the episode, Bran Stark continues his time-traveling journey with the Three-Eyed Raven. Meanwhile, in the present time, a hoard of White Walkers led by the Night King close in on the cave that Bran and his group have been hiding in. As Meera Reed and Hodor prepare their escape, Meera asks Bran to warg, a form of mind-controlling, into Hodor's mind so that he can rescue his unconscious body out of the cave, which Bran obliges by warging into a younger version of Hodor, a cheerful stable boy then known as "Wylis," in the past. As they flee their way out of the cave, Meera pleads Hodor to "hold the door" to buy her and Bran enough time to escape safely, a command that echoes through the past into Wylis' head and triggers him to lapse into a state of seizure and "hold the door!" over and over again. As Hodor complies with the request in the present time, the character is overrun and killed by the White Walkers while "holding the door." On March 2nd, 2006, blogger Charley Campbell used the phrase "the face you make" when mocking a photograph of himself shouting at the ceiling while packing (shown below).[2] On July 14th, 2013, Cringe Channel[1] user Ironcringe posted a two-pane image featuring mirror selfies of a man with CGI-rendered wings of a devil and an angel, along with the misspelled caption reading "I can be your devil or angle" (shown below).

While Hillary Clinton had already emerged as the winner of the Nevada caucuses in February, many supporters of Bernie Sanders showed up at the convention with high hopes that the final count of the delegates would swing in Sanders' favor. During the procession, chaos suddenly erupted from the crowds when the party officials declined to accept the credentials of nearly 60 of Sanders' prospective delegates, which made them ineligible for the final count and thusly Hillary Clinton emerged as the winning candidate. Many supporters of Sanders in the crowd reacted angrily to their ruling with jeers and violence, ultimately prompting the staff to conclude the event early to ensure the safety of the participants. While the degree of violence at the scene has been disputed by supporters of both candidates, many major news outlets reported that chairs and other objects were thrown around and the state party's chairwoman Barbara Boxer was harassed with death threats.

A typical "Storytime" video will feature a YouTuber telling a story about a dramatic experience in their life, such as "MURDERER AT SCHOOL | STORYTIME" (shown below), or "MY HAUNTED HOUSE STORYTIME | PARANORMAL ACTIVITY CAUGHT ON CAMERA + EVP."[1] Videos like these have been the target of mockery due to their dramatic nature and people doubting the veracity of the titles. One of the earliest known examples of a joke at "StoryTime" videos' expense came on October 8th, 2016, by Twitter user @drewistru,[2] whose tweet has gained over 800 retweets and 1,700 likes as of December 20th (shown below).

In the post, he defined clickbait as: "Any content or feature within a website that “baits” a viewer to click. “Anything interesting enough to catch a person’s attention”. More often than not, click bait uses “highly alternative text/phrasing”, ”controversial slogans/ideas” or “culturally inspirational descriptions/events”. Click bait is similar to link bait but is generally seen as less effective, more shortsighted and more shortlived."

However, the Facebook post Sizzle sourced to has been removed, meaning that it may have existed prior. Another image, this time referencing the Lego Star Wars videogames (shown below, right), links back to a working Facebook post[2], dating back to August 22nd as well. It may be the earliest online trace of the meme which garnered, as of January 2017, more than 1,900 likes and 1,100 shares.

As part of her speech, she read a letter[1] Coretta Scott King, wife of Dr. Martin Luther King, wrote to Strom Thurmond arguing against the appointing of Sessions to the Federal Court as a judge in 1986. At that moment, Mitch McConnell brought forth an objection that Warren was breaking Rule XIX of the Senate, which barred senators from impugning each other's character. The Senate then voted 49-43 to bar Warren from participating in further debate on the confirmation of Sessions. When asked later for an explanation about the incident, McConnell said of Warren, “She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted.”[3] At the 2017 Grammy Awards, which took place on February 12th, 2017, CeeLo Green dressed in an all-gold outfit complete with a matching gold mask.

The image was inspired by the final part of the game after Leon saved Ashley on a jetski, creating a bastardized version of Ashley's offer to Leon for "overtime" at her place and Leon's subsequent rejection.     The earliest known image macro examples were uploaded as part of the first world problems meme on Twitter in early 2013. On February 21st, 2017, The Washington Post changed their slogan on the website to read "Democracy Dies in Darkness."[1] The quote is meant to demonstrate to readers that The Washington Post will provide strong journalistic coverage of politics.

On April 2nd, 2009, the advertising news blog AdWeek[1] posted an article titled "Why Aren’t More Athletes Making Better Use of Facebook Public Profiles?", which contained a photograph of O'Neal sleeping (shown below, left). On July 24th, 2016, the Thot Patrol Facebook[4] page posted a picture of O'Neal waking up for thots (shown below, right). While it's unclear which post was the first to photoshop the Hot Pockets box, variations began appearing on Instagram in November of 2016.

On February 19th, 2017, @__iamqueenk began a thread on Twitter telling the story of how @KashMoneyKanee left her stranded at the airport after visiting him in Washington D.C.[1] According to her, @KashMoneyKanee had paid for her trip to Washington D.C. for Valentine's Day and had made clear that he was very romantically interested in her, going so far as to print a picture of her face on a shirt. After a nice time together, @__iamqueenk missed her flight home, and texted @KashMoneyKanee asking to pick her up from the airport. After saying he would, he doesn't show up, leaving her stranded at the airport.

On October 10th, 2016, twitter user chaz hutton tweeted about Grammarly. His tweet was retweeted 4 times and liked 18 times. On November 23rd, 2016, Disney animated film Moana premiered in the United States.[1] In one scene of the film, demigod Maui performs song "You're Welcome" to the titular character Moana.

About halfway through the video, one presenter, Claudia Restrepo from the blog Oscar Hates Sexism, plays through a scene that takes place at a strip club. The original video has since been removed. On April 25th, the video was reuploaded to Facebook (shown below). "I wrote a blog post[2] a while ago about why I fucking hate video games, because this is what it does! It appeals to the male fantasy!" On June 13th, 2011, the single topic blog Descriptive Noise[1] launched with a still shot from the History Channel’s show Larry the Cable Guy (shown below).

Brawl and Playstation All-Stars Battle Royale under the caption "app soundcloud vs bandcamp" on March 12th, 2017.[1] However, it wasn't until March 30th, 2017 that the trend caught on, when Twitter user @jsmithyeet tweeted an image comparison with the caption "SoundCloud vs. Bandcamp."[2][3] The first tweet received seven retweets and 13 likes, while the second received more than 9,000 retweets and 27,000 likes.

Pullum and Glen Whitman through a series of short columns published via Language Log.[14] The earliest known discussion about the term can be found in Pullum's blog post titled "Phrases for Lazy Writers in Kit Form"[6] published in October 2003. In the article, Pullum asserted there has been a growing need of a descriptor for overused phrasal templates or journalism cliches: It now occurs to me that we also need a name for another linguistic figure, also noted by Mark but not yet named. Roughly speaking, the thing we need a name for is a multi-use, customizable, instantly recognizable, time-worn, quoted or misquoted phrase or sentence that can be used in an entirely open array of different jokey variants by lazy journalists and writers. On January 16th, 2004, Pellum wrote about his colleague Glen Whitman's suggested neologism "snow clone,"[7] thus formally introducing the term to his readers for the first time. Soon thereafter, Pellum began tracking the history of widespread snow clones and documented his findings on his blog.

According to the website How to Geek:[10] The golden Legend of Zelda cartridge featured an internal battery that powered a small RAM chip which stored player progress. For the first time console gamers could save the game at any point and return to it later. Games were no longer limited to a race-to-the-finish style delivery. Because of this, the size of the in-game universe and the complexity of the game could be greatly expanded as the designers knew players would be able to complete the game over multiple sessions at their leisure. On April 30th, 2009, Urban Dictionary defined "quick save" as "A method for instantly saving the state of a video game, designed for pussies who cannot beat the game without cheating."[6] On July 8th, 2016, Redditor Coryan posted "'I'd better save first' is often the gamer's version of 'hold my beer'" in the /r/Showerthoughts subreddit, receiving more than 3,100 points (93% upvoted) and 45 comments.[8] Several months later, on December 29th, Redditor hesinthetrees posted "Quicksaving is like the gaming equivalent of 'Hold my beer'" to the /r/Showerthoughts subreddit.[7] The post recieved more than 150 points (91% upvoted).

Over time, other playlists would also use this name. On February 13th, 2017, Spotify released a commercial titled "Play This at My Funeral," in which the leader singer of the dance-rock band DNCE, Joe Jonas, comments on how Spotfiy user allymann14 lists the band's songs on a Spotify playlist titled "Play This at My Funeral," stating "that's a pretty messed up funeral" before showing pall bearers dancing while carrying a casket (shown below).

As of May 2017, the tweet has received more than 17,200 retweets and 23,100 likes. The conspiracy was first introduced by Liz at AvrilEstaMuerta,[1] a Brazilian blogspot, on May 6th, 2011. The conspiracy supposes that after Lavigne grew famous following her smash debut album, 2002's Let Go, she hired a doppleganger named Melissa Vandella to distract the paparazzi, and Melissa and Avril became friends.

As evidence, Liz points to images of Lavigne in different times where she has different skin blemishes (shown below). Furthermore, lyrics from songs such as "Together" and "Nobody's Home" can be interpreted to be references to the switch.

The meme originated when MySpace user Rich Owens wore a shirt saying "Bitches Don't Know Bout My Dick" (shown below, left) The photo was edited by multiple users to make the shirt read something else (examples shown below, center, right). This was one of the first "single-pane" exploitable templates (an exploitable based off one image) to grow into a popular meme.  On June 20th, 2017, the Dallas Zoo uploaded a video titled "Breakdancing Gorilla Enjoys Pool Behind-the-Scenes" to YouTube, in which the 14-year-old western lowland gorilla Zola frantically spins around in a pool of water while thrashing about (shown below). Within one week, the video gathered upwards of 2.06 million views and 280 comments.  On September 6th, 2016, Tumblr user dentiuschestus[7] created a remix of Kirby background music titled "When your kids are playing kirby super star upstairs on your $4000 subwoofer" (shown below); muffling the sound of the theme while keeping the bass highly present to make the theme appear as if it was played in another room using expensive hardware. Over the next 9 months, the post gained over 27,000 notes. On July 23rd, 2014, the photo appeared in a press release from the Los Angeles Zoo[3] promoting their "Brew at the Zoo" event (shown below). On June 22nd, 2017, the LAist Twitter[4] used the photo to promote the event as one of "20 Awesome Events Happening In Los Angeles."

In 1989, London, England resident Dr. Joseph Popp authored a trojan horse virus known as the Aids Info Disk, which prevented users from accessing certain directories and encrypted the C: drive, demanding a payment to a post office in Panama to unlock the files. Popp was subsequently arrested by British authorities and charged with eleven counts of blackmail. On February 15th, 2016, Tumblr user masklayer uploaded a photoshopped McDonald's logo spelled "McNaldo's: I like the it™".

Later that day, the meme account @drops[2] shared the post in its entirety, receiving more than 500 retweets and 1,200 likes. Roughly two weeks later, another Twitter user, @yahboycourage,[3] used that image in a new tweet, captioning it "yo where tf my uber driver taking me." Within two months, the post received more than 9,100 retweets and 16,600 likes. On May 7th, 2015, the SHEA YouTube channel uploaded a video titled "People react to being called beautiful," in which .

The series is rumored to have started on 4chan's /b/ (random) board as early as September 2010, but an archived thread has yet to be found. The earliest known thread[1] dates back to December 17th, 2010, which began with a photo of a peach with the caption "peesh." At the 2017 BET Awards,[3] Chance the Rapper was filmed holding his chest and smiling. During the the broadcast, Twitter user @YoAdriBaby posted the moment to Twitter with the caption "I had to rewind to capture Chance in his essence 💛."

On October 13th, 2011, the Community episode "Remedial Chaos Theory" aired.[2] In the episode, the character Jeff Winger rolls a six-sided die to determine which character will pick up a pizza order. The character Abed warns Jeff, "You are now creating six different timelines." The episode then shows what happens when each character picks up the pizza in a series of vignettes. In the character Troy's vignette, Troy leaves to get the pizza and a series of incredibly unfortunate events occurs, resulting in one character getting shot and the apartment lighting on fire (shown below, left). The episode ends with Jeff picking up the pizza and things returning to normal, but during the episode's credits, we see what the group's life is like in the future after Troy picks up the pizza, which Abed coins "The Darkest Timeline" (shown below, right). The show continued to reference "The Darkest Timeline" through the remainder of its run. On March 23rd, 2014, Tumblr [1] user the-grin-reaper posted the comic of "How to talk with short people." In the comic, a person seen leaning over to talk to a short person is marked "Leave" (shown below). The post received more than 234,700 notes in less than six years (shown below). The GIF comes from a televised Coldplay concert for the BBC which Jay-Z attended. During the Coldplay song "Lovers in Japan," the camera cut to Jay-Z in the crowd, and the footage captured became the GIF (shown below). A GIF of the moment was posted that day to Soompi[1] by user goodvibrations. The meme is based off of the "I put spongebob music over" Meme. The Youtube user "Jmak" Uploaded the first "I put Wii music over" video on May 8th, 2017. Popularity was slim with only 15k views. On June 21st, 2017, Snapchat[1] revealed the "Snap Map," a feature which allows users to see the location of their friends on a map by pinching the screen to zoom out. Friends will appear as an avatar called "Actionmoji," which closely resembles a Bitstrips character. The feature is opt-in, meaning it will not be activated unless users choose to activate it. On July 6th, 2017, Reuters photographer Mike Brown photographed Vice President Mike Pence inside the Orion cleanroom at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida placing his left hand on a critical piece of space flight hardware that bore a warning label "DO NOT TOUCH." In the photograph (shown below), Kennedy Space Center Director Robert Cabana can be seen tugging Pence's jacket, perhaps in an effort to stop him, as Senator Marco Rubio stands in the background.[1]  The song is sung by Count Olaf, played by Neil Patrick Harris, and the people who live in his house. The song describes the count's characteristics and is sung in the episode "The Bad Beginning (Part 1)" after the Baudelaire children return to the house after getting ingredients for their dinner that night. Three days after the episode's release, the YouTube user copop22 posted a a video titled "Its the count but every count is replaced with yee!", where the word "count" was replaced by the Yee scene from the Dingo Pictures film Dinosaur Adventure (shown below, left). The video gained only 537 views. On the same day, SparkySywer uploaded a video titled "It's the Count but when they say something that rhymes with "Count", Klaus gets bitch slapped", in which every word that rhymes with count was replaced by a scene of Count Olaf slapping Klaus from the same episode of the show (shown below, right). The video gained over 13,000 views. Using the "right triangle" and "radio button" emoji, it is possible to make what appears to be an audio player for Twitter. On September 14th, 2016, @memearchives[1] posted a prank tweet making it appear as though Twitter had unveiled an audio tweet feature (shown below). The joke format began appearing in late June of 2017. On June 21st, Twitter user @eunseotrash[2] posted a tweet about how much she loves K-Pop idol Eunseo of the group Cosmic Girls (shown below, left). On June 30th, @Salsizabeth[3] posted a joke about her fandom for Sansa Stark of Game of Thrones (shown below, right). This appears to be the first instance of what would become the joke's most-used format. The comic panel is itself an exploited panel of the DC Comics character Plastic Man comic in which the character is ingesting a box labeled "Salt" and saying "What." The earliest known date it appeared online is April 3rd, 2016, where it appeared in a Reddit thread arguing RWBY shipping. [1] The variation in which the texts are altered to read "Yes" and "Powder That Makes You Say Yes" appeared on Reddit in /r/bonehurtingjuice[2] on July 4th, 2017. There, it gained over 860 points. The video clip is a part of a Japanese Adult Video titled [PTJ-005] Aoi Yuuki – Gero Monster Home Delivery On March 20th, 2013, Belgian cartoonist Jeroom Snelders posted a four-panel comic of Superman seeing a burning building that has the words "Community Center for Elderly Lesbians" on it. In the comic (shown below), Instead of helping the people inside, Superman goes to a phone booth and changes into the clothes of Clark Kent, Superman's secret identity. The final panel shows Clark Kent walking down the streets, whistling to himself. When posted to Facebook, the comic received more than 1,000 reactions and 213 shares.[5][6]  Spike's appearance is based on his Generation 1 incarnation more than his Generation 3 version, with a few modifications done by Lauren Faust. In G1, he was portrayed as a baby dragon with green spikes, and his body was pink. In his G3 incarnation, he was a 1,000-year old dragon with orange spikes, purple hair, and a blue body. He is the only main character who was taken from G1 other than Applejack. The 2014 documentary A Brony Tale mentions that Ashleigh Ball, the voice of both Rainbow Dash and Applejack, originally auditioned for Spike. Dog Spike, as he is in the human world, is not human because, as stated by Meghan McCarthy, "1) It would be weird for Twilight to hide a small boy in her backpack. 2) Dragon through portal doesn’t = same as pony." Lauren Faust said in an interview that she had to fight for Cathy Weseluck to be the voice of Spike, because Hasbro originally wanted him to sound rather gruff and scratchy, similar to Charlie Adler's interpretation of the character in the G1 movies and TV series. Spike's crush on Rarity was not planned out from the beginning. When Lauren Faust was writing Rarity's introduction scene in the pilot, she wanted the audience to understand that she's very beautiful even though she is visually very similar to the other ponies, except the style of her mane and her eyes and eyelashes. To let the audience understand that she is beautiful, Faust made Spike become smitten with her, which developed into his crush on Rarity. In August of 2005, user Ozone31 created a site on YTMND that takes a clip from the 2004 movie Anchorman: The Legend Of Ron Burgundy of a cowboy getting stabbed by a pitchfork. The scene is done in a sepia tone with music typical of the 1920s playing throughout. Other additions are a title card saying "Ouch!" as the cowboy is hit (a reference to silent films) and fake mustache and top hat on his killer. On May 16th, 2017, the trailer for The Emoji Movie was released. Within two months, the trailer has received more than 2.3 million views.[1] The trailer introduces viewers to the world of the film, in which emojis are alive and selected by users. When the user selects Gene, the emoji does not make the right face (shown below). The following dialogue is heard: "What's he doing?" "He's making the wrong face!" On July 24th, 2017, President Donald Trump son-in-law and special counsel Jared Kushner held a press conference to publicly deny allegations that he colluded with the Russian government during the 2016 United States presidential election. The speech (video below) followed a meeting with the Senate Intelligence committee regarding his involvement with Russia.[1] The original footage of the bullet slicing the objects is taken from an unknown Korean television series that aired on EBS (Educational Broadcasting System) sometime between 1995-2001 (evidenced by the logo in the footage). In September of 2006, YTMND user tricolor found the footage and edited it so that each object is shot down in succession (as if they're set up one by one), unlike the original where it's obvious they're being shot one at a time. All this was set to Franz Schubert's "Ellens dritter Gesang" (better known as "Ave Maria"). User cliffmartinez uploaded this footage (with its original music and uncut) to YouTube on April 20, 2012. It sits at only 50 views as of 2017. On June 28th, 2005, YTMND user ava11 submitted a page featuring an audio clip of the DAoC player, which gathered upwards of 20,400 views over the next 12 years.[1] On May 8th, 2016, the doujin 命蓮寺絵日記 まとめ ("Myourenji Enikki Matome") was released at Reitaisai 13, an annual Touhou convention. The image comes from a panel in which the character Kyouko screams (shown below). Later that year, on August 31st, an anonymous 4chan user posted the image to the /jp/ board under the thread "what doggie says?"[2] The Japanese writing, however, had been photoshopped out of the image, so that it could be used as a template. The video was originally uploaded to Jamster's YouTube channel in 2010, though it did not become a meme until seven years later. The video depicts a CG vampire kid who wants to win the heart of a girl he encounters outside of her house. As he frolics the playground near him, he sings a Bieber-esque song about how he can't do this due to being a different species before flying away as a bat. As of 2017, the upload sits at 2,027,529 views, though with a fair amount of dislikes. The earliest traceable post to use the format was posted on July 25th, 2017 to Facebook page 8memes.[2] The post gained about 12,000 likes and reactions and over 26,000 shares (shown below). It is worth noting that the image has a watermark pointing to @hassan.sohail01, suggesting that the image came from an Instagram user of that name. However, as of July 31st, 2017, no account with that exact handle exists.  While the satirical newspaper has been in publication since 1988, the phrase "Not the Onion" did not come into prominence until the mid-00s. On October 25th, 2008, the subreddit /r/NotTheOnion launched.[1] This page allowed users to submit bizarre and funny news articles that look like satire but were, in fact, real. As of July 2017, the subreddit had more than 12 million subscribers. On August 18th, 2013, the YouTube account for Unistal,[1] Protegent's parent company, uploaded a three minute commercial for their Protegent software. In the video, four cartoon men discuss their issues before being approached by Proto, Protegent's superhero mascot. As of August 2017, the video (shown below, left) has been viewed 5,500 times. The following year, on February 25th, Unistal[2] uploaded another Proto-based commercial in which the character raps. This video inspired a large number of the remixes involving Protegent (shown below, right). The earliest known screamer Kikia began circulating on the Taiwanese web in 2003, which features a poorly drawn boy sitting in a field and walking in a market place before the screen turns white and a frightening face from the video game Fatal Frame II is abruptly flashed on the screen (shown below). On May 7th, 2017, YouTuber • Grymice • uploaded a video titled "Kanye West Glitch Meme," in which rapper Kanye West is datamoshed mid-sentence before while high-pitched audio can be heard in the background and the screen turns red over a clip of a man yelling (shown below).

On June 16th, 2015, DeviantArt [1] user Mickking posted a two-panel webcomic of young boy pulling a woman and crying while pointing at a Jurassic Park movie poster in 1993. The adjacent panel shows the same boy and woman in the same position and pointing at a Jurassic World poster in 2015. According to Dictionary.com,[1] "clout" is a derivative of the Middle English word "clūt," meaning a worthless piece of cloth, which originated before 900 A.D. During the 1960s, Chicago-based journalist Mike Royko began using the word to describe influential politicians, business and community leaders. Antonin Scalia was known as a very conservative Supreme Court Justice, and unexpectedly passed away on February 13th 2016. On February 14th an image of Justice Scalia was uploaded to the image sharing site Imgur [1] The song itself was released as the first single to Lopez's seventh album Love?, exactly two months before the album. The song is a EDM-influenced club track with a rap section from Pitbull. Upon release, the track did very well and became one of the highlights of Love? A music video was released in March that garnered a similar amount of acclaim as the song itself did. It currently sits at over a billion views as of 2017. The meme itself originated in early June 2011 when user icywintermints uploaded an animation that started with a still of her character as the song's drop builds up. When it drops, the character starts dancing until the end. As of now, the video only sits at almost 500 views. On December 24th, 2014, Tumblr [1] user shejla24 posted an image of a Facebook chat conversaton between a man and another. The man says to the recipient, "Hey sexy…send me a pic of you." The recipient sends a photoshopped version of the man's profile picture with long hair and make up. The man responds, "Why did you put hair and make-up over my photo? I don't want to talk to you anymore." As of August 2017, the post (shown below) received more than 580,000 notes. It is rumored that Jim's creation took place on a Discord server. While ironically jeff'ing, user Ebnetboy [3] replaced the name "Jeff" with "Jim", prompting extensive humourous responses. A quick google search revealed that Jim actually existed [4] under the name "Jim DeFede" and looked like this: Following this revelation, Jim was promptly incorporated into the "Sons of P'taah" cult lore. He has become a recurring figure, his name being uttered or his photo being displayed in almost every video posted [5]. The first instance of a "Tell ISIS" variation can be traced back to Twitter. On December 10th, 2015, user @Bill_Nye_Tho[1] posted a photoshop of United States President Barack Obama talking on the phone with a pistol telling ISIS to pull up to the White House. The tweet garnered 523 Retweets 934 Likes, as of August 30, 2017. On Aug 12th, 2017, Crunchyroll Tweeted out a message[1] saying: The message refers to a spin-off anime called Boruto: Naruto Next Generations which is currently airing. It's possible Crunchyroll believed fans of this show would be more familiar with Boruto than Naruto. On October 12th, 2013, Imgur user 50YrDoctorWhoFanboy uploaded a photograph of an office building titled "This has to be one of the most evil buildings in the world," marking the earliest known use of the term in reference to ominous architecture (shown below). On August 31st, 2017, the official Sonic the Hedgehog Twitter account announced several pre-order bonus costumes for Sonic Forces, which included skin based on the protagonist Joker from Persona 5 (shown below).[1] Following the announcement, many began joking that the costume was a depiction of Joker's "fursona." On August 27th, 2017, Capcom uploaded a trailer for the character to YouTube (shown below). She debuted as part of the second Street Fighter V DLC package on the 29th. Most commonly, the template is matched by a popular picture of a raccoon standing upright and cradling a cat in its arms. The picture (shown below) first appeared on a Japanese blog called nobukatsu[1] on December 15th, 2009. Three years later, on February 6th 2012, Redditor [2] crayclaycray posted the picture on Reddit, where it garnered more than 560 points (79% upvoted) and 50 points. Snopes[3] has since debunked the picture, claiming that it was indeed photoshopped. On January 2nd, 2015, Twitter [4] user @lanyardigan posted the picture of the raccoon and cat with the caption "Please. My wife. She's very sick." The post (shown below) has since been deleted, however, Blogspot[5] user joannecasey posted a screenshot on January 15th. At the time of the screenshot, the picture (shown below) had received more than 7,100 retweets and 11,000 likes. On February 10th, 2006, the website MemePolice Forums[1] were created for discussions about "examining and creating cultural memes."  The screencap comes from episode 20 of the anime Code Geass R2: Lelouch of the Rebellion, "Emperor Dismissed."[1] In the episode, the character Lelouch addresses his father, busy imploring gods for assistance, that the gods will not help him. This scene is where the screencap comes from (fan translation of the screencap shown below). Sons Of Ptaah has a versatile history. Similar to the Cult of Kek, it incorporated previously existing mystical and religious elements while adding its own lore on top of it. In his natural habitat Discord, user Guneo [1] mentioned on an ironic server that he had discovered the "Ashtar's Galactic People Cult" [2]. Intrigued by this news, user Ebnetboy [3] proposed that the group publicize their own grand truths extending the original revelation of Ashtar. And so Sons Of Ptaah was born, the cult's first lore video being uploaded on June 19th 2017 [4]. A wide range of diverse memes have spawned from Sons Of Ptaah, often involving phrases, dates and divine beings essential to the cult. The cult's name stems from the character P'taah, a central personality in yet another astrological new-age sect [5]. On May 29th, 2017, Safely Endangered uploaded the comic "Survive" to the site Webtoons.[1] Two days later, a four-panel version was uploaded to Twitter, [2] where it gained over 280 retweets and 890 likes. This is the version that became the exploitable (shown below). On August 29th, 2010, AMC[1] aired the episode of the television series Mad Men entitled "Waldorf Stories." During the episode, the main character Don Draper wins a prestigious advertising award, and while riding on the high of winning, he decides to pitch a campaign to Life cereal while drunk. Draper then pitches while visibly intoxicated. This moment of him attempting to maintain composure in front of a white board is the inspiration for the meme. On May 24th, 2011, YouTuber [2] ryleeryno posted the scene to YouTube, receiving more than 279,000 views in six years. Two years later, on March 21st, 2012, Uproxx[3] published a list entitled "If Don Draper Handled Modern Marketing." Within the list of parody pitches by Don Draper, the author included an image from "Waldorf Stories," with the logo for Netflix and the word Qwikster, Netflix's botched DVD mailer rebranding (shown below). This post is the earliest example of the meme available. On August 29th, 2017, the official Twitter [1] account of the Green Bay Packers NFL team posted a picture of player Aaron Rodgers with a mustache. They captioned the tweet "The stache 👨🏻 #PackersCamp." The post (shown below) received more than 2,300 retweets and 7,000 likes. Although the exact first use of the term "ironic meme" online is unknown, the ironic fandom of Disney's Cory in the House beginning in mid-2008 with the remix video "Top 27 Anime Boobs," uploaded on August 23rd, 2008, by YouTuber[1] TheSaltySaltySalt, serves as one of the earliest known examples of an ironic meme (shown below). Spawned from a running joke that referred to Cory in the House as an anime, this early ironic meme was originally created on 4chan's /v/ board and became the source of a tongue-in-cheek running gag following the release of a video game for the Nintendo DS based on the series. This video was first uploaded in 2007 but was deleted and reuploaded afterward, accumulating over 875,000 views, 5,700 likes, 3,500 dislikes and 1,700 comments in roughly 12 and a half years. Photoshopped images of Cory and screenshots of the various dialogue screens from the game were widespread in early ironic meme culture, while the game itself was constantly used as a way of trolling whenever the leak of a new game was asked and as an ironic response in "favorite videogame" threads.[2] This ironic humor then spread to Reddit shortly after, particularly to the /r/gaming and /r/askreddit subreddits.[3] In the original clip taken from the 1950 episode entitled "Jerry and the Lion," Tom sneaks behind a door while doing an evil laugh as he plans to catch Jerry. Shortly after, Tom closes and locks the door as he gets outsmarted and physically beaten by Jerry off screen. The earliest known appearance of the image can be traced back to a tweet posted by @Tweets_2dope[1] on July 27th, 2013, although its usage as a meme didn't begin until early 2016.  On August 28th, 2017, the Ubisoft US YouTube channel released a trailer for the game Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle, in which the character Luigi is shown performing a dab dance move (shown below). Within 72 hours, the trailer gathered upwards of 53,400 views and 350 comments. On August 30th, 2017, the New York Times Opinion Twitter[1] account shared an op-ed written by Erik Prince, the found of Blackwater, an infamous private military firm.

The tweet was captioned, "Trump's plan to increase troops in Afghanistan will merely continue the conflict, says Erik Prince," and received more than 10 retweets, 21 likes and 100 comments. In the Naruto anime series, which premiered on October 3rd, 2002, Naruto is often shown running with his arms angled behind his body (shown below). On September 6th, 2006, YouTuber mfbrice uploaded footage of himself mimicking the running stlye in a video titled "Anime Run" (shown below). On August 28th, 2017, Twitter[1] user @MattWalshBlog posted a picture of a man carrying a woman who was cradling a baby during Hurricane Harvey. He captioned the picture, "Woman cradles and protects child. Man carries and protects both. This is how it ought to be, despite what your gender studies professor says." The post (shown below) received more than 7,600 retweets and 20,000 likes in two days. While the origin of the "deep fried meme" is unknown, the earliest known post to call the image type a "deep fried meme" was posted to Tumblr on March 24th, 2015 by paparoachscarsmp3[2] (shown below).

The earliest example of the scene and concept being used as a meme occured sometime in 2016 on the website imgflip.[2] In this version, a one-panel image macro (shown below), features a screenshot of actors Anne Hathaway and Wes Bentley from the scene with the caption "1 HOUR ON THIS PLANET IS 7 YEARS ON EARTH GREAT LETS WAIT FOR THE DEPLOY QUEUE HERE."

In explaining the most common method of peer-review, Kennedy mentions how reviewers would typically type in "LGTM" to express their approval, especially when communicating via email. Previous to Mondrian code review was conducted largely over e-mail using Google command-line wrappers built on top of Perforce. A developer could initiate a code review from within the g4 mail tool, which would fire off an e-mail and begin a review thread. When the developer receives a response of “looks good to me,” or lgtm for short, they could proceed to checkin.

The episode has gained over 4.5 million views (shown below). On August 15th, 2017, the website KnowYourMeme updated to include the pop-up shown below. The pop-up has been hated on for numerous reasons, because it appeared every time a new page is opened/refreshed (this was changed a few days later to just appearing once)[1], but mainly because KnowYourMeme has a negative reputation among the community for containing ads that, at best, cause lag, and at worst, install malware. After the addition, Staff member Brad posted a thread about the popup on the site's maintenance forums[2].

On August 14th, 2017, actor James Woods tweeted a picture of the United States Marine Corps War Memorial, also known as the "Iwo Jima Memorial," with the caption "Before the #liberals find a reason to deface, destroy or degrade this one, I thought some of you might like to see it one more time…" (shown below).[1] Woods' tweet came amidst debate in America following the 2017 Unite the Right Rally, which was started in protest of the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee, the general of the Confederate Army in the United States Civil War, about whether America should remove statues of other prominent figures in the Confederacy. The tweet gained over 13,000 retweets and 28,000 likes. The Russian source for many popular posts is Tumblr user markv5,[1] a Russian Tumblr user who began posting mostly photos of cats in January of 2015. One of the first posts of makv5's to be popularly translated into English a picture of a cat in a watering can uploaded November 27th, 2016.[3] On January 5th, 2017, Tumblr user alexyar[4] provided a translation of markv5's caption, "another proof that cats are liquid." The post gained over 150,000 notes (shown below). The original scene comes from the fifth episode of season 11 of The Simpsons titled "E I E I (ANNOYED GRUNT)," which aired on November 7th, 1999.[2] In the scene, Homer parks outside the titular farming supply store "Sneed's Feed & Seed" (underneath in parenthesis reads "Formerly Chuck's") before being berated by two men (seen below).[1] The first internet reference to Sneed's Feed & Seed comes from an episode capsule text document written on March 27th, 2000, by Benjamin Robinson on the Simpson's Archive[4] website (shown below). In the post, Robinson detailed the hidden innuendo in the title by pointing out the correlation of "Sneed, feed and seed" all ending with the suffix "-eed," meaning Chuck's former ownership would imply the "-uck" suffix instead — leading to the store formerly being "Chuck's Fuck & Suck" if following the initial starting letters.   The original source is from the fourteenth episode of the sixth season of the show, entitled "The Cart Before The Ponies". The episode primarily focuses on the fillies of Cheerilee's class prepping for a go-kart race, while being assisted by an older character. Before and during the actual race, Cheerilee can be seen in a cheerleader's outfit and cheering for the racers. A clip featuring Cheerilee in her outfit was uploaded to YouTube by Letupita725HD on August 7, 2016. It currently sits at over 800,000 views. In November 2015, American football player Cam Newton spoke at a press conference, where he claimed fans had encouraged him to "Dab on them folks" during football games (shown below). A common image used in the charts is a parody of the chart from The Human Centipede in which a person has their mouth sewed to the person in front of them's anus, and so on. In the parody chart, original content goes in the first person's mouth, representing 4chan. Each person in the chart represents a different series of sites, and by the time the original content hits the last person, the meme is dead. A version of this chart was posted on April 21st, 2011 to /r/funny,[2] though it is possible earlier posts featuring the chart existed (shown below). On February 26th, 2015, Vine user Jared Friedman[1] posted a video in which a girl is seen vaping at a party. A man then turns to the camera and expresses his mock amazement by saying "wrow." The below YouTube embed has over 54,000 views. The opening theme song of Friends, "I'll Be There For You," was co-written by the show's executive producers David Crane and Marta Kauffman, along with Phil Sōlem and Danny Wilde of the American pop rock duo The Rembrandts, who recorded the song as their first single from their third studio album LP. On June 9th, 2013, the 10th episode of season three of Game of Thrones aired on HBO.[1] In the episode, the character Gendry, the skilled blacksmith and bastard son of the former king, escapes a witch who intends to burn him at the stake via a rowboat (shown below). Following the episode, Gendry took a four season break on the series, and did not appear again until season seven. In between then, people online begane theorizing that Gendry had just been rowing his boat since his last appearance. On August 7th, 2017, Twitter user @Manda_like_wine,[1] aka Amanda Williams, tweeted a photo of her child Luca's drawing of Janet. According to the caption of the image, "Janet cuts people in half with giant scissors. She is a hero only to herself." The tweet gained over 16,000 retweets and 56,000 likes (shown below).

When the boomerang lands in his pants, Rolf cannot stop singing opera whenever he opened his mouth. On August 9th, 2017, Twitter user @OMGItsBirdman[6] tweeted a photograph of a Walmart rifle display with the sign "Own the School Year Like a Hero" placed on top (shown below). Within 24 hours, the tweet gained over 63,000 likes and 31,300 retweets. The sequence originates from the fifteenth episode of the sixth season on the series. In the episode, Rainbow Dash takes her idea of pranking way too far. After a prank spree around town, the resident plead Pinkie Pie to make her stop. Pinkie devises a plan, which is to have everyone eat cookies with rainbow filling in them and act like zombies demanding for more cookies to scare the wits out of Rainbow. Eventually, Rainbow admits to her wrongdoings. Soon, footage from the episode was uploaded to YouTube, one of which is by user Letupita725HD on August 14, 2016, not long after its US premiere. On August 2nd, 2017, Twitter user @Loopzoop[5] posted "Sex is an intimate and sacred act.

On May 15th, 2017, Australian website 9news[1] ran an article recapping a 60 Minutes episode in which millionaire property mogul Tim Gurner said “When I was trying to buy my first home, I wasn't buying smashed avocado for $19 and four coffees at $4 each.” Gurner was attempting to make the point that millennials spend too lavishly to afford a home, while older generations saved money in order to invest in a home. However, the quote about avocado became a subject of derision as it became the focus of dialogue around Gurner's comments. TIME[2] tweeted an article that claimed Gurner stated "Stop buying avocado toast if you want to buy a home." The scene from the film in question comes in two different edits: the original and overseas version. Both occur after Fritz saves a family of mice from an orange cat in the titular Titanic. The son, named Maxie, says in both versions "If it hadn't been for you, I would be in someone else's digestion.' In the overseas edit, it is here that Fritz starts rapping "Party Time." In the original version, there is more of a lead-in, where Fritz speaks to the mice to be careful next time before he raps (which sounds different and is slightly shorter, with less reused animation). The overseas edit was uploaded to YouTube on April 9th, 2008, while the original version was uploaded on August 18th, 2009. The overseas edit has over 912,000 views (shown below). On March 29 2017 YouTuber Carcinogenesis uploaded a video to his YouTube channel called "Julia Has A U T I S M", gaining over 185,000 views and 4000 likes.

Ruocco (@AGuyWhoDraws) May 15, 2016 On April 9th, 2016, the Esther Verkest Facebook[1] page posted a comic in which Verkest arrives on a desert island and makes a "Help" sign out of rocks, which fails to attract the attention of planes flying by. After changing the sign to "Slut," multiple rescuers arrive to her aid (shown below). On August 8th, 2017, a photograph by Associated Press[1] photographer Boris Grdanoski of Manchester United soccer player Marouane Fellaini being in the face with a soccer ball appeared online. The photo, shot in super high-quality, shows his lips and face malformed in the instant following the hit (shown below). The picture was taken at the UEFA Super Cup final soccer match between Real Madrid and Manchester United.  The track was first released on April 6, 2016 as the lead single from D.R.A.M.'s album Big Baby D.R.A.M., and received positive reviews from critics and listeners, though some criticize its reference to the Columbine school shooting. The song is well known for its flute hook during the chorus. An official video was released for the track in July of that year. This video currently sits at over 2 million views and over 1 million likes.  On January 31st, 2017, Instagram user @gucci.gameboy[1] submitted a stock photograph of three people seated at a corporate board room table, captioned with a mock conversation in which a boss asks why their company needs to cease animal testing if the practice is done by shampoo manufacturers, to which the employee replies "Ya but we make dildos" (shown below). Within seven months, the post gained over 15,500 likes. On February 14th, 2012, Redditor animal_backwards launched the /r/NotTimAndEric subreddit.[1] The board specializes in the type of off-kilter, surreal comedy found on the comedy television series Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! However, the videos posted are not affiliated with the comedy team. The subreddit was created after non-Tim and Eric videos kept appearing in the /r/TimAndEric[5] subreddit. The page's content guide describes the type of content they are looking for: Redditor[4] Boncef posted one of the earliest examples to gain traction on the subreddit on December 2nd, 2012. The video "Kevin Claps for Ann" (shown below), which features an awkward interaction between a young girl playing the violin and a young boy complimenting her, received more than 620 points (98% upvoted) before archiving. The video is one of many videos uploaded by registered sex offender Edward Muscare. Even though police have forbbied Muscare from using the Internet, he continued to upload videos online. One of these is of him lip synching to "Pretty Woman". Eventually, the police found out and took him into prison. The video sits at over 3 million views today. Other videos from Muscare include Feel The Music and Backscratcher.  On August 7th, 2017, comedian Jen Kirkman began a tweet thread in which she attempted to lay out her theory that Bernie Sanders was a paid agent by Russia to sabotage the 2016 Presidential Election for Hillary Clinton. She tweeted: 1. Here's the deal. I believe in my heart Bernie is a KNOWING chaos agent paid by Russia in 2016 election. This is my OWN conclusion. Her tweet was shortly deleted thereafter, but a screenshot is shown below. On June 22nd, 2013, Redditor nl13 submitted a stock photo of an old man and a young boy titled "Fun Times with Gramps," with a caption of the man chastising the boy for wearing a T-shirt with the word "Surf" written on it (shown below). Prior to being archived, the post gained over 1,800 votes on the /r/funny[1] subreddit (86% upvoted).  Sometime prior to late January 2007, a series of videos began circulating online along with a creepypasta story about a fictional television broadcast hijacking that occurred in the area of Niobrara county in Wyoming, Nebraska. According to the Something Awful Wiki, the story was a prank and alternate reality game orchestrated by Something Awful goons Senor Bambos and The Detector.[4] Kaur originally self-published Milk and Honey on Amazon in 2014.[1] The book was re-released on October of 2015 after being picked up by Andrews McMeel Publishing.[7] It was on the New York Times Bestseller list for a full year and has sold over 1 million copies (excerpt shown below). As the book grew very popular, it became the subject of parodies on Twitter from those who did not find the poetry as appealing as others. One of the early popular parodies was posted by @ricardojkay[2] on June 24th, 2017, gaining over 19,000 retweets and 44,000 likes (shown below). On November 14th, 2007, the comic Scott Pilgrim Gets It Together was released, in which the titular protagonist is hit on the head with a ball in volume 4, page 9, leading his love interest Ramona to ask "Are you well? Do you have brain damage?" (shown below, left). On June 30th, 2011, the panel was uploaded to Scott Pilgrim's Precious Little Wiki (shown below, right).[3] The first known instance of this type of video comes from YouTuber Malpass93.[1] On November 4th, 2008, Malpass93 posted their first logo remix entitled "Ident Remix 1 – C4 1982 Blocks with HTV 1980s Blocks music." In this video, the British television network Channel 4's old blocks were played with HTV's 80s theme music. The video (shown below) received more than 6,900 views in eight years. Many times, especially British based videos are referred to as "Logo Ident Remixes." According to Dictionary.com,[5] "Ident" means "a short visual image employed between television programs that works as a logo to locate the viewer to the channel." On July 22nd, 2016, Adult Swim uploaded an exclusive sneak preview from San Diego Comic-Con of the third season of Rick and Morty to YouTube. [1] In the clip, Rick is shown as a pickle-shaped being, who murderers a rat and steals its brain. The video (shown below) received more than 3 million views in one year. On July 31st, 2017, Tumblr user ectorobotic[1] posted a text post that read: do not join the @/bpdconcept discord server as there is, and im not joking, constant talking of bodily fluids including one member taking pictures of themselves eating gelatin made from their own piss. they also made a joke claiming that “bpd stands for big piss drinkers” and i dont know about you but i would not like my mental disorder which could cause serious problems to be demoralized and compared to piss drinkers. The user then posted screenshots of the conversation in question (some shown below), calling out Tumblr users @quisiderium,[2] hpdbailey (since deleted), and @screagee.[3] The post has gained over 7,800 notes. The slang first appeared on the advice animal Lil D-Wade, a school photo of basketball player Dwayne Wade. Due to the doubtful face on Wade's face, a common caption for the photo was "Oh, word?" Several versions made in the template had a typo which read "Oh, worm?"[1] (example shown below). Gwynndolin first posted this image to Tumblr on September 19th, 2016.[8] The post became a Tumblr meme following posts by user 6thhouse on November 9th[2] and November 10th, 2016[3] in which he obsessed over the phrase (shown below). The second gained over 16,000 points.  Box-chan was posted to the Random server on Discord on August 3rd 2017. They were posted along with a couple more images of drawings that imouto had drawn with their sister, though no comments were made on any of the drawings other than Box-chan. The character began as a circle imouto had drawn for their sister (most likely just the body), before imouto said that they were going to mess it up, and then, messed it up. The original image featuring Box-chan depicts the character holding out a box and saying, "box desu" (with "desu" being written in Japanese characters), though other users thought it it said, "box?". The video originally appeared on Olivier de Sagazan's website in 2008, where it would be uploaded to YouTube on his own channel the same year. The video starts off with Olivier taking a seat in a front of a grey background in what appears to be a studio. Shortly after, he starts taking off all his clothes, at which point he starts bathing himself in clay. As soon as his full frontal body is covered, he takes out a small paintbrush and dabs black eyes for himself. He also makes a mouth with this paint as well. He even gets a yellow wig for hair. He continues to repeat the process multiple times, using water to splatter everything so he can start over, until the end where he finally shakes everything off his face before it abruptly cuts off. Many more similar videos can be found on his YouTube channel and website. On February 2nd, 2016, musician and animator Bill Wurtz uploaded a video titled "History of Japan", where he briefly summarizes Japan's history. Around two minutes into the video, Wurtz begins discussing people hiring samurai, saying "How are you supposed to protect your shit, from criminals? Hire a Samurai." The video has gained over 31 million views (shown below).[1] On July 29th, 2017, WaterGuy12 posted on the r/me_irl subreddit, where he talks about how he is going to a place without WiFi for two weeks (until August 14th), and asked the people of the sub reddit to tag him on any good memes so that he "doesn't miss out"[1]. In the following 6 days, the post accumulated over 9,000 upvotes. The video was posted to YouTube on February 2nd, 2016. Prior to making it, Wurtz has made many short videos about odd themes, which he claimed were used to experiment and to practice montage.[1] The video gives an abridged explanation of Japan's geographical, sociopolitical and cultural history from 40,000 BC to present day. In the following month, the video gained more than eight million views and over 180,000 likes, which has resulted in an increase of search interest for "history of Japan" and media coverage of his works. The short film was created by David B. Earle and uploaded to his YouTube channel in 2006. It depicts a gray skinned girl sitting at the dining room table with spoon in hand. In the background, a fire is visible through the window. She starts off with her eyes closed, before opening them, where she proceeds to talk nonsense to the viewer (this phrase is actually backwards). As she does this, the camera zooms slowly out down the table. As we move back, the girl faceplants in her bowl. After a while the camera stops moving, and it lingers on the scene for a bit until the scene starts reversing. The girl ends up getting back to her previous position and speaks clearly "There is nothing". She then closely her eyes again, ending the film. The film was meant to show a scenario that can be looped infinitely.  In the game Splatoon 2, players can posts illustrations or messages in a dialogue box in the game's multiplayer lobby, Inkopolis Square. In late July 2017, people began complaining about illustrations of anthropomorphic animals being frequently posted in the lobby, leading players to post messages asking for others to "stop drawing furries" (shown below).  On July 30th, 2017, author Robert Tripp posted to Instagram[1] about his wife, Sarah Tripp, a body-positive fashion blogger and owner of Sassy Red Lipstick (shown below). In the post, he lauded his wife's curves, and spoke about his attraction to women who did not fit the social standard for attractiveness (i.e., not skinny). || I love this woman and her curvy body. As a teenager, I was often teased by my friends for my attraction to girls on the thicker side, ones who were shorter and curvier, girls that the average (basic) bro might refer to as "chubby" or even "fat." Then, as I became a man and started to educate myself on issues such as feminism and how the media marginalizes women by portraying a very narrow and very specific standard of beauty (thin, tall, lean) I realized how many men have bought into that lie. For me, there is nothing sexier than this woman right here: thick thighs, big booty, cute little side roll, etc. Her shape and size won't be the one featured on the cover of Cosmopolitan but it's the one featured in my life and in my heart. There's nothing sexier to me than a woman who is both curvy and confident; this gorgeous girl I married fills out every inch of her jeans and is still the most beautiful one in the room. Guys, rethink what society has told you that you should desire. A real woman is not a porn star or a bikini mannequin or a movie character. She's real. She has beautiful stretch marks on her hips and cute little dimples on her booty. Girls, don't ever fool yourself by thinking you have to fit a certain mold to be loved and appreciated. There is a guy out there who is going to celebrate you for exactly who you are, someone who will love you like I love my Sarah. || photo cred: kaileehjudd</a></p> <p style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;">A post shared by ROBBIE TRIPP™ (tripp) on Jul 30, 2017 at 6:10pm PDT Both the New York Times and the New Yorker[3] cited the resurgence in popularity of Borat Voice 'My Wife' as a contributing factor to the spread of "wife guy" humor. In the New Yorker, Jia Tolentino wrote that "My Wife" "highlights a ludicrous aspect of both heterosexuality and our more general desire to possess those we love. And, once you’ve been around it enough, it is fairly irresistible." In 2017, Twitter saw a spike in jokes built off inserting "Borat Voice My Wife" into song lyrics. Some popular examples include a post by @LeftAtLondon which used the lyrics to The Killers' "Mr. Brightside", gaining over 70 retweets and 360 likes (shown below, left). A tweet posted by @KeiferLirette on November 12th made the joke with Hozier's "Take Me To Church," gaining 13 retweets and 113 likes (shown below, right). In 1986, Kleenex released a Japanese advertisement featuring a young woman in a toga offering a kleenex to a toddler dressed as a Japanese ogre, before reaching for a tissue.[1] The woman makes loving gestures at the child before the commercial fades out and fades back in to the two watching the tissue fly away. The ad is set to the song "It's A Fine Day" by Jane.[4] The commercial was one of three featuring the characters. On May 23rd, 2006, YouTuber derioderio uploaded two of the commercials to YouTube. The first, and more popular video, entitled "Japanese baby ogre kleenex commercial." The video (shown below, right) received more than 1.1 million views in 11 years. The second commercial was significantly less discussed. It featured a baby with angel wings on holding a tissue (shown below, right) and received more than 180,000 views in 11 years. On May 28th, 2016, Twitter user @fioses[1] posted the image of the dog with the sign on the window, gaining over 56,000 retweets and 89,000 likes (shown below).

The video has gained over 29,000 views as of August 3rd, 2017 (shown below). DM A post shared by David Nixon (@_youngkingdave) on Jan 12, 2017 at 12:53pm PST The earliest known usage of the character comes from the Facebook[1] page "BelykBro" (pronounced: Be Like Bro), who posted a picture of the character on March 14th, 2016. The picture (shown below) received more than 11,000 reactions, 180 shares and 400 comments. On July 23rd, 2017, HBO[1] aired the second episode of the seventh season of the hit series Game of Thrones entitled "Stormborn." Toward the end of the episode, the characters Daenerys and Jon are set up to meet, igniting fan excitement. That night, Twitter [2] user @dasassenach posted two behind the scenes[3] of Clarke and Harington talk on their phones on the set of season seven. They captioned the post "'E aí, já saiu de casa?' 'Calma tia, já to chegando' #GOTS7 #GameOfThrones" (translation: "'Have you left the house?' 'Relax. I'm on my way'). The post (shown below) received more than 270 retweets and 440 likes as of August 4th. Using the acronym IRL to mean "in real life" originated in the 1990s in early Internet chatrooms and forums. The phrase was often used to distinguish between someone's online persona and their real occupation or existence. According to The Daily Dot[4], the "me irl" coinage was originally used by furry writer and artist Jurann Foxtail in 1997. Foxtail's website's "About" page has a description of the artist's "fursona" in which it describes how the character "even looks like me IRL".[3] In early 2010, the term "Fite Me IRL, Fgt," also became popular through association with Navy Seal Copypasta and forums like Bodybuilding.com. The photograph originates from a 2012 London fashion show for Burberry’s Spring Summer 2013 Womenswear Show. The meme started trending again on August 1st, 2017 on Reddit after users started photoshopping the photograph. Reddit user TediBare123[1] created the “PSBattle: Aaron Paul confused by fashion”[2] thread on August 1st, 2017, which encouraged Reddit users to put their own spin on photograph with Photoshop. The thread has over 1,000 comments and has inspired other similar threads about Aaron Paul's confused look to emerge. The short video was created by artists Michael Ronson and Jason Kovac for Destination Imagination 2001, an art showcase competition.[1] While it is unknown how the video did at the competition, the video would gain more recognition when it was uploaded to YouTube by user fividtelefuzzerator on June 13th, 2006 (shown below). The video starts off with a low quality VHS warning screen. After that, text appears saying: In the year 2571, a videocassette was found in a pile of rubble on the ruins of a certain blue planet. What you are about to witness are not the contents of the cassette. This is an entirely different recording.* Next up, footage of cartoon characters walking up to the screen with text stating "Let's Make A New Friend" appears. Then, audio of screaming begins to play. This screaming accompanies shots of the characters as they are distorted with various visual effects. The video ends soon after as the music begins to degrade. The screaming is from the French film A Cry From Within, while the music is from the American film The Human Tornado. The video has gained over 1.5 million views.  On June 5th, 2015, Redditor gwiller posted a screenshot of a post about the "Top 10 Sexiest Female Olympic Athletes Ever" published by the Indian Celebrities Facebook page, to which an unknown Facebook user commented "Ausaaam bobs" to /r/indianpeoplefacebook[2] (shown below, left).

The tweet gained over 850 retweets and 3,900 likes in one day (shown below). The tweet came after stories of the Democrats' ideas for official campaign slogan which were highly mocked. On July 5th, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee sent out ideas for slogans via email that many considered feckless, leading to parodies of the email. Then, on July 20th, it was leaked that their slogan would be “A Better Deal: Better Skills. Better Jobs. Better Wages,” which was also mocked online. On January 22nd, 2017, Twitter user @PapaCone_[1] tweeted an illustration of the Spongebob Squarepants character Squidward taking a selfie with the caption "might delete soon but I felt cute in this pic 😋😘🙊💖" (shown below). Over the next seven months, the tweet received upwards of 43,200 likes and 18,500 retweets. On August 1st, 2017, Netflix launched a campaign about diversity and representation called "First Time I Saw Me" or "#FirstTimeISawMe." The purpose of the campaign is to raise awareness about the representation of people of color in popular entertainment, and to do that, Netflix interviewed to directors, writers, creators, actors and fans of color to tell their story of the first time they related to someone on TV or in the movies. The first video featured on Netflix's Facebook[1] page featured Krissy, who points to the Netflix series One Day at a Time as a realistic and positive representation of Latino and Cuban culture (video below). On December 17th, 2016, Twitter user @chochos posted a photograph of a woman staring at a man in bed captioned with mock internal monologues in which the woman thinks "seguro está pensando en otra" ("surely he is thinking of another" in English) as the man thinks to himself "¿por qué en Star Wars se oyen las explosiones si se supone que el sonido no se propaga en el vacío?" ("Why are there sounds in Star Wars if it is assumed sound does not travel in space?" in English). Over the next years, the tweet gathered upwards of 2,200 likes and 1,700 retweets. The quote is from the gay pornographic film Private Lessons 3, which was uploaded to Men.com on July 23rd, 2017.

Get Nerf." for "It's Nerf or Nothin'." The earliest examples of the line being used in a commercial is from a series of 1993 ads featuring Final Destination actor Devon Sawa. The earliest example of "Nerf or Nothin'" being used as a meme, comes from the Tumblr [7] account starwarrior. On October 25th, 2011, they posted a two-panel image macro (shown below). In the top panel, Star Wars character Princess Leia says the famous line from The Empire Strikes Back, "You half-witted, scruffy looking nerfherder!"

On July 31st, 2017, President Donald Trump tweeted [1] "A great day at the White House!" The tweet (shown below) received more than 22,000 retweets and 101,000 likes. However, despite Trump's statement, many online were quick to point out that on the day Trump posted that, his Chief of Staff John Kelly had already fired his controversial director of communication Anthony Scaramucci, after just 10 days of employment. Things continued to get worse that day as news of the Russiagate scandal broke that he had dictated a false statement regarding his son's meeting with a Russian lawyer on his son's behalf.[2] The latter could be a potentially legal issue. Website anthropomorphism has been a long-running theme in meme culture since the early 2000s, as well as similar application to other groups of things, including nation-states, TV shows, drugs, automobiles and other consumer goods.

The earliest known video using 3AM in its title is "EXPLORING EMPTY HAUNTED APARTMENTS! (3AM)", which was uploaded by Guava Juice on Oct 30th, 2016 (shown below). However, due to the fact that there don't seem to exist any other videos of this type around this video's upload date, it is possible that Guava Juice edited the title some time after the initial upload to capitalize on the trend. As of July 26th, 2017 the video has over 6 million views.[2] On May 17th, 2012, the 79th episode,[1] "Sekka Gym Battle!

People have believed that the Earth is flat since the beginning of humanity, but the modern Flat Earth hypothesis stemmed from an experiment called the Bedford Level Experiment, conducted in the mid-1800s by a man named Samuel Rowbotham.[1] Rowbowtham, who wrote a book named Earth Not a Globe, started the modern movement by debating scientists publicly and accumulating followers. In the experiment, Rowbowtham attempted to measure the curvature of the earth by observing the curvatures at a local river. He took his results as disproving the theory of a round earth, but future scientists have said that the results he obtained could be accounted for by the parallax effect.[2] In 1956, Samuel Shenton created a more modern version of the Flat Earth Society, to collect a variety of followers of Rowbowtham's experiments. When the first images of the earth taken from space were released, Shenton claimed that they were false. In the 1970s and 1980s, they released a newsletter called the Flat Earth News, which often debated NASA and other space agencies.

On July 12th, 2017, Kellyanne Conway appeared on Sean Hannity's Fox News program to discuss Donald Trump Jr.'s Email controversy. During the interview, she argued that the emails he tweeted, which revealed that he was informed of a Russian government plan to swing the 2016 presidential election in favor of Donald Trump, did not prove collusion with a foreign country.

Vice[1] traces the origin of online porn games to the 80s with MS-DOS games. They have remained a subsection of the pornography industry for some time. Advertisements for these sorts of games appear to have begun to appear in the mid-2010s on pornographic websites. The advertisements typically promised the player would orgasm multiple times in a short amount of time. On October 7th, 2015, Twitter user @FuckYoTimeline[5] posted a GIF of a pornographic ad they found on a website with the caption "Ads on porn websites are hilarious" (shown below). On October 10th, 2015, a Redditor referenced the trope in a thread on Game of War.[4] The earliest traceable parody of the advertisement appears to have been posted on May 2nd, 2016 on Instagram account uber.dude.png.[2] On May 4th, 1999, "All Star" was released as the second single off Smash Mouth's second full length album Astro Lounge.[1] The song became one of the group's most successful hits, having peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 list in August that year.[4] That year, the comedy superhero film Mystery Men was released, which featured the song on its official soundtrack. Additionally, scenes from the film were used in the official music video for the track (shown below, left). In 2001, the animated film Shrek was released, which featured "All Star" during the film's opening sequence (shown below, right). While President Trump had mentioned Jim on the 2016 campaign trail, Jim became a national news story on February 24th, 2017. During his speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, President Donald Trump discussed foreign policy and the growing threat of terrorism in Europe (video below). As an example, he delivered an anecdote about his friend "Jim." He said:[1][2] "I have a friend, he's a very, very substantial guy. He loves the city of lights, he loves Paris. For years, every year during the summer, he would go to Paris, was automatic with his wife and his family. Hadn't seen him in a while. And I said, Jim, let me ask you a question, how's Paris doing? "Paris? I don't go there anymore, Paris is no longer Paris." That was four years -- four or five years hasn't gone there. He wouldn't miss it for anything. Now he doesn't even think in terms of going there." That day, Twitter user @RubenBolling[3] posted a stock photos of an elderly man golfing with the caption "Please, help Donald Trump's friend 'Jim,' who can't go to Paris anymore. Give generously. #IStandWithThatSubstantialGuyJim." The tweet (shown below), which received more than 50 retweets and 60 likes, implied to mystery over the existence of "Jim."  On July 5th, 2017, the animal rights group Beagle Freedom Project tweeted a poster with the heading "These Companies Test On Animals," followed by various company logos and a photograph of a beagle dog (shown below).[2] On July 7th, Redditor EvMARS posted a multi-pane image which zooms in on a photoshopped SoundCloud logo on the poster followed by a photograph of a chihuahua with earbuds in its ears (shown below). Over the next four days, the post received more than 3,100 points (97% upvoted) and 160 comments on /r/dankmemes.[4] According to a Redditor T1m_the_enchanter,[2] the still comes from the Reid film Naughty Book Worms 43. On June 30th, 2017, the first known edit was posted by the Instagram page bandmemes666[1] and related to a mishap that might befall a stage musician (shown below). The post gained over 6,300 likes.   On March 16th, 2015, the Facebook account ironyisdeaditsmemecemetary posted an screenshot from a Snapchat. The screenshot featured a mustachioed-man wearing perforated sunglass with the flag of India printed on them. Underneath the man's face is the caption "Let's go boys." The post (shown below) received more than 30 reactions and 20 shares.[1] The scene originated from the episode "Little Muriel" where poor Courage has only ever known the adult, harmonic and serene Muriel, so having her spoiled, unruly and hyper childhood self to deal with is pretty hard on him. After failing to make a macaroni and cheese platter to her satisfaction, and keeping her from playing in the dangerous ruins of the farmhouse, he can't take it anymore. The image comes from episode 19b of the 1967 Spider-Man cartoon, "Double Identity."[1] In the episode, a villain attempts to impersonate the titular hero. The earliest known use of the two characters dressed as Spider-Man pointing at each other was an image macro posted February 5th, 2011 on Sharenator[2] in a compilation of 60's Spider-Man images (shown below). "Despacito" was released on January 13th, 2017[1] along with its music video, (shown below) which has gained over 4 billion views and 22 million likes (as of October 2017), making it the most viewed and liked YouTube video of all time. "Despacito" became the fifty-fourth video to reach 1 billion views on April 20, 2017; the twelfth video to reach 2 billion views on June 16, 2017; the first video to reach 3 billion views on August 4, 2017; and the first video to reach 4 billion views on October 11th, 2017, doing so within 272 days. On July 11th, 2017, Brooks published "How We Are Ruining America" in the New York Times.[1] In the column, Brooks argues that generations of college-educated Americans are generally upper-middle-class Americans, and use the financial advantages that come with the class to ensure the same future for the kids, while those who don't share those advantages have a difficult time ensuring a college education for their kids. Furthermore, Brooks argues that the system favors upper-middle-class Americans to keep this social hierarchy intact. Cities such as New York, Portland, and San Francisco have zoning laws that keep lower-income families out of the city and away from good opportunities. Brooks then attempts to make a point that the upper-middle-class codes language and culture with signifiers that are "illegible unless you happen to have grown up in this class." To demonstrate this point he tells an anecdote about when he and his high-school educated friend visited a gourmet sandwich shop: "Recently I took a friend with only a high school degree to lunch. Insensitively, I led her into a gourmet sandwich shop. Suddenly I saw her face freeze up as she was confronted with sandwiches named “Padrino” and “Pomodoro” and ingredients like soppressata, capicollo and a striata baguette. I quickly asked her if she wanted to go somewhere else and she anxiously nodded yes and we ate Mexican." On December 26th, 2005, YouTuber kristoferpaetau uploaded a video entitled "Art Forum accident." As he explains in the description, "I started to feel really bad at the opening of the Art Forum 2005 Art Fair in Berlin. And suddenly I couldn't help myself, I had to vomit." As of July 2017, the video has been viewed more than 7,500 times.[1] Additionally, Kristofer Paetau blogged[2] about the incident on his website Paetau.com. In the post, he uploaded a series of screenshots from the video with captions to describe what was happening. On June 25th, 2016, YouTube HDSenpai uploaded "You Say Run" to YouTube. The post (shown below) received more than 6.2 million views in a little over a year. About three weeks later, on July 13th, 2016, The My Hero Academia official soundtrack was released, a month after the Season 1 finale.[1][2] The following day, July 14th, 2016, Youtube user natsu taka uploaded "You Say Run goes with everything (SRW Z3)"[3] (shown below, left), a video of cutscenes from the Banpresto PS3 title Super Robot Wars Z3. The image used in the meme was first found on the website bytekings.com, which is now a free domain. It was featured in a gallery of imaged tagged "nerd". The first instance of its use as an advice animal image was on kulfoto.com, in the following image. The base still shots are from a Spider-Man animated television series that ran from September 9th, 1967 to June 14th, 1970. It was jointly produced in Canada (for voice talent) and the United States (for animation) and was the first animated adaptation of the Spider-Man comic book series, created by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko. Sometimes referred to as "Spider-Man '67," the series was notorious for its bad art and often over-the-top script as early as 2004.[7] The show reached a newfound audience in 2009 after Marvel officially began streaming the episodes via its website on April 2nd, 2009.[8] The episodes were subsequently reviewed on geek culture blogs like Topless Robot[9] and Daily Pop[10]. The image macro originated on 4chan some time in 2009 after users of the board /co/ (cartoon) began threads inviting fellow users to watch original episodes of the show together via streaming services. The overuse of stock animation like images of Spider-Man swinging across skylines was representative of the show's low-budget production, leading to plenty of funny, awkward or odd moments throughout the series. After the viewing of each episode, users would post screenshots in the thread with summaries of episode highlights. One of the earliest instances of such threads on 4chan dates back to July 19th, 2009[5] titled "Spider-man on his day off." The discussion thread contained 153 posts featuring images of Spider-Man with humorous titles that are very similar to the overlaid text found in the image macros like LOLcat. As time went on, these screenshots were saved for further circulation and evolved into reaction faces or captioned image macros. On August 26th, 2014, episode #285 of the Rooster Teeth Podcast was released, in which hosts Gus Sorola, Gavin Free, Matt Hullum and Burnie Burns discuss a hypothetical scenario in which a person receives $10 million in exchange for having a snail follow them wherever they go for the rest of their life that will kill them upon being touched (shown below). The scene comes from Hunter x Hunter's chapter 357 of the manga, released on June 13th, 2016. The chapter covers the conclusion of the fight between characters Chrollo Lucifer and Hisoka Morow, with Hisoka losing the battle after Chrollo blows him up with his ability. After being confirmed dead by a group of characters, Hisoka suddenly wakes up and explains character Machi that he survived by using his nen (energy that exists in the Hunter x Hunter universe and grants different abilities), injecting gum on his heart and lungs to restart them. The catchphrase can be seen on the fan scanlation from Mangastream, in a flashback describing the events right before his death, where he orders his nen to resurrect him after his death. The most popular iteration of Donald Duck boner, in which Donald stands up-right with his blue hat on, comes from a frame near end of the Disney animated anthology film Saludos Amigos, released August 24th, 1942.[9] During the segment "Aquarela do Brasil" (shown below), Donald swallows a bee, and as the bee moves throughout his body, it pushes up against Donald's stomach, creating a bump that resembles an erection. While Donald Duck has been part of the Disney canon since 1934, the earliest known example of the infamous picture of him with a supposed erection online appeared on the helli6n wordpress on August 2nd, 2010.[1] The image has since been removed, but less than a month later, on September 6th, the image (shown below) appeared on Funnyjunk with a watermark from 4gifs.com, meaning it likely dates back farther. Another variation, in which Donald is lying on his back, is a still from the Disney animated short Wide Open Spaces, released September 12th, 1947. In the film, Donald attempts to sleep outside on an air mattress. However, a rock underneath his mattress pushes all the way through his body, creating a bump in his stomach that looks like an erection. On May 27th, 2007, YouTuber Groudon0199 uploaded a video titled "Hotel Mario (Common nouns in intro replaced with big explosions)" (shown below). Within the 10 years, the video gained over 27,000 views and 70 comments. In July 2007, an article titled "Teach Your Dog to Speak" was submitted to WikiHow,[1] which includes an illustration of a woman giving a dog a treat after barking when told to "speak" (shown below). On March 29th, 2012, YouTuber anamanaguchi uploaded a parody of the sequence titled "Game of Fuckin' Thrones," which gained over 1.6 million views and 1,400 comments. According to Uncle Dolan[2], the comics were originally created during the summer of 2010 by artist Sakolut[1] on the Finnish image board Kuvalauta. Titled “Aku Ankka” (Finnish for "Donald Duck"), the comics featured poorly drawn MS Paint characters and misspelled captions in speech bubbles. The first Dolan comic seem to be posted on early May 2010 on Naurunappula and the Meme Generator pics with the actual Dolan face date to early July 2010 to the creation time of "Akun Neuvo" (Donald's Advice) group on Naurunappula.[22] Following the repeated use of "Dolan" on English imageboards to refer to the character of Donald Duck, the comics eventually became known as "Dolan" comics. The earliest archived instance in English-language comes from a You Laugh, You Lose thread on 4chan[4] posted on August 12th, 2010. The /r/dolan[7] subreddit was created two days later on August 14th, 2010. On July 7th, 2017, a bearded man dressed in black was photographed taking a selfie in front of a pile of burning trash while protesting the G20 Summit in Hamburg, Germany. The picture was subsequently tweeted by Torsten Beeck, a digital strategist for the German news site Spiegel Online.[2] Within 72 hours, the tweet received more than 6,200 likes and 2,200 retweets. On February 9, 2016, MatPat uploaded "Game Theory: UNDERTALE – Sans's SECRET Identity!" to The Game Theorists' channel. Since then, the video has accumulated over 7.4 million views, and has a mostly positive reception on YouTube with 192,000 likes and 18,000 dislikes. On June 7th, 2017, Brandon Wardell tweeted the first sheriff using the "100" emoji and the caption "howdy. im the sheriff of suckin u off. im gon suck u off."[1] The tweet gained over 8,500 retweets and 24,000 likes (shown below).

While serving 190 years for the assassination of Jewish radio host Alan Berg and other crimes with The Order, Lane wrote the articles "88 Precepts" and "14 Words." "14 Words" were adopted as the de facto mission statement for the white supremacy movement.[1] The "14 Words" are: "We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children." White supremacists consider the numbers 14 and 88--sometimes combined as 1488--as significant amongst their cause. "88," referencing the eighth letter of the alphabet, "H." Together, 88 is code for "HH," or "Heil Hitler." On December 4th, 2016, Devin Le published the original comic, "The One about a Baby" on the website Webtoons.com for his series "According to Devin."[1] In the comic, Le presents a four-panel story about a young couple meeting their newborn son for the first time. The father says to the child, "You my son and no matter what, your mother and I will always love you." The child responds, "I think Cars is the best Pixar movie of all time." In the final panel, the child is seen in a cardboard box wit the words "Free Disappointment (comes w/ a bow)" written on the side. The comic (shown below) received more than 1,400 likes. On December 31st, 2012, Tyler, The Creator posted a tweet mocking those who consider cyberbullying a credible threat, suggesting that those who are being harassed online "just walk away from the screen" or "close their eyes" (shown below). Over the next five years, the tweet gathered upwards of 317,400 likes and 345,800 retweets. On July 6th, 2017, Twitter user glitchedpuppet[1] tweeted a short comic about the extreme sexual dimorphism presented in video games, juxtaposing a male anthropomorphic rodent creature with a female variation (shown below). Within four days, the tweet gained more than 29,800 likes and 21,400 retweets.  On May 3rd, 2002, superhero film Spider-Man [1] directed by Sam Raimi premiered in the cinemas, followed by the sequels Spider-Man 2 [2] in 2004 and Spider-Man 3 [3] in 2007. The films followed adventures of the high-school student Peter Parker who gets bitten by a radioactive spider and develops superhuman abilities, becoming a superhero named Spider-Man. In one scene of the first film, Spider-Man mocks his opponent Bonesaw by commenting on his outfit with a gay joke. That's a cute outfit. Did your husband give it to you? On March 21st, 2014, an anonymous 4chan[4] user posted the quote to /tv/ board, with several commenters pointing out that the quip would cause outrage if Spider-man was released in 2014 due to the joke's homophobic nature. Through 2014 and 2015, the argument received further support in multiple /tv/ threads[5][6][7][8], while on April 22nd, 2014, the joke was labeled "racist" by CinemaSins[9] YouTube channel. In one such thread launched on January 17th, 2016, an anonymous user provided a complex analysis of the phrase, reversing the message in the joke[10]. On January 27th, 2016, an anonymous 4chan[11] user writing under the nickname Sudowoodo posted a more offensive version of the quote in a /tv/ thread, giving the start to the Raimiposting trend. The earliest known instance of the #watermelondress meme can be traced back to August 13th, 2016, when Instagram user @widyawince shared photographs of a little girl wearing the watermelon dress in forced perspective; however, the trend didn’t actually take off until May 2017. On May 8th, 2017, Instagram user @firuzetan shared a photograph of a baby wearing the watermelon, gaining over 300 likes. On November 7th, 2014, the first cinematic trailer for Overwatch was released, in which several heroes fight over control of Doomfist's cybernetic gauntlet (shown below).

His ultimate shoots out two dragons that deal damage and move forward forever until they hit the edge of the map. When he uses his ult, he yells "Ryuu ga waga teki wo kurau!". On May 10th, 2016, YouTuber Scar uploaded a commercial for a toy bow by Nerf dubbed with Hanzo yelling out the phrase (shown below). On February 10th, 2016, Cyanide and Happiness released a comic in which a woman requests that her lover "talk to me like you're a fucking idiot" mid-coitus.

The choices were "Resist, Persist," "She Persisted, We Resisted," "Democrats 2018: I Mean Have You Seen The Other Guys?", and "Make Congress Blue Again" (email[1] shown below). On June 11th, 2017, Tumblr user vampirequeenoffan[1] uploaded a two panel comic expressing her frustration with the criticism she had seen some creators receive for making potentially offensive content. Her rant begins "*Inhale* Okay Tumblr, We Need To Talk" (shown below). The post has received over 5,500 notes as of July 6th, 2017. "Is Now Playing" is based on the notification banners from the digital gaming distribution platform Steam. On Steam, when a friend begins a game, a notification banner appears that shows their avatar and says "[Username] Is Now Playing [Name of Video Game] appears (shown below). The earliest iteration of parody memes of this format appeared in 2016. On March 17th, 2016, vrutal user Themasteroflag uploaded a photoshopped version of the notification, replacing Donald Trump as the profile picture and username, so the the notification read "Donald Trump is now playing Papers, Please," commenting on Trump's immigration policy. The post (shown below) received more than 270 points and 90 comments.[5]  The earliest appearance of the hot dog on YouTube was posted on June 23rd, 2017, making it the likely day it was introduced on Snapchat (shown below).

On May 25th, 2017, he posted three screenshots from the scene, replacing the shot of Justin with different man smiling.[1] As of July 2017, the post has received more than 900 likes. The exact date that "Blow it out your ass" was first posted is unknown. The catchphrase was often used by American posters in response to other countries' criticism of America.  In 1988, Electronic Arts released Skate or Die for computers and the NES,[1] marking the first time the phrase appeared in popular culture. Several popular answers on Urban Dictionary for the phrase trace the origins back to the 80s. A definition by Clay1[2] mentioned the phrase was popular in the 80s but had become for "posers." On June 30th, 2017, Governor Chris Christie signed an executive order, declaring a state of emergency due the state of New Jersey's failure to pass a budget before the constitutional deadline, effectively shutting down the government.[1] The shutdown -- the second in state history -- closed various state services, such as motor vehicle services, courts, taxation offices, disability and family leave, travel centers and state parks and beaches, among other things. On July 2nd, two days into the shutdown, the Star Ledger, New Jersey's largest newspaper, published photographs of Governor Christie and his family enjoying Island Beach State Park (shown below), one of the beaches closed by the shutdown order for the July 4th holiday weekend. The image in question comes from Eminem's music video or "Without Me" (shown below). On June 25th, 2017, Redditor BedlingtonTerrier[1] posted the first known edit to /r/ComedyCemetary, saying that he saw his friend post the edit on iFunny, though it's unclear if that's true. The post gained over 3,200 points (shown below). The earliest example of "tú no" comes from the Netflix Latino Facebook account.[1] On June 15th, 2017, the account posted a nine-panel image featuring supporting characters from various Netflix original shows. Each photo has one word from the sentence "Ellos se ganaron nuestro corzaóm aun siendo secundarios," which roughly translates to "They have conquered our hearts despite being secondary characters." However, the middle image, one of 13 Reasons Why villain Courtney Crimsen had the words "tú no" over them.[2][3] On June 29th, 2017, Emmanuel Macron officially released his Presidential Portrait in a tweet[1] that gained over 30,000 retweets and 92,000 likes (portrait shown below).

The earliest known usage of "nothing burger" comes from Hollywood gossip columnist Louella Parsons in reference to actor Farley Granger's release from Sam Goldwyn's studio MGM.[4] In her June 1st, 1953 article "Louella's Move-Go'Round," she wrote, "After all, if it hadn’t been for Sam Goldwyn Farley might very well be a nothingburger."[1] The earliest known reference to using "Pee Your Pants" as a way to spam neo-nazis appeared on June 20th, 2017 in a post by nazicallout,[3] who mentioned inflitrating a neo-nazi Discord chat with the phrase "Pee Your Pants" (excerpt shown below). The term "trap," not to be confused with "trap house" (a place where illegal drugs are bought, sold and used) or trap music in hip hop culture, stems from a reaction image based on a scene from Star Wars: Return of the Jedi, wherein Admiral Ackbar is quoted as saying "IT'S A TRAP" upon discovering an ambush by an enemy fleet. As the reaction image continued to gain traction across anime hub sites like Something Awful and 4chan over the next decade, the word "trap" itself gained recognition as a slang label for a transgender person in general. On March 1st, 2017, rapper 21 Savage appeared on ESPN's Highly Questionable. During the appearance, 21 Savage appeared via satellite with a new haircut and in front of a green screen of a cityscape. The appearance became a breif source of controversy after the rapper was cut off by ESPN, presumably for rapping one of his songs while self-censoring inappropriate language with coughs. Later that week, on March 8th, Twitter user @Trashvis[1] tweeted a screenshot from the interview with the caption "why this pic look like 21 Savage is a supervillain interrupting a broadcast to reveal his evil plan to the world." The post (shown below) received more than 113,000 retweets and 215,000 likes in three months. The phrase stems from a memorable quote said by Admiral Ackbar (voiced by Erik Bauersfeld), the leader of Mon Calamari rebels, during the Battle of Endor in the 1983 Star Wars film Episode VI: Return of the Jedi. In the movie, as the Alliance mobilize its forces in a concerted effort to destroy the Death Star, Admiral Ackbar encounters an unexpected ambush, which leads him to exclaim, "It's a trap!" Admiral Ackbar: "Take evasive action. Green Group, stay close to holding sector MD-7." Crewman: "Admiral, we have enemy ships in sector 47!" Admiral Ackbar: "It's a trap!"

In 1999, the 64DD (a disk drive peripheral for the N64), was launched in Japan. Nintendo had produced a short film using the 64DD's Mario Artist: Talent Studio's avatar maker, which includes clothes and a built-in movie editor. Nintendo designer Yamashita Takayuki attributes his work on Talent Studio as having been foundational to his eventual work on the Mii. The Mii as it's known today made it's debut in 2007's Wii Sports.

In the game's bonus material, she is described as a girl who, despite her powers over the cold, is idiotic and childish. She is the strongest fairy in the series, but because fairies are generally weak, she is rarely considered a threat. She later appeared as a mid-boss in Perfect Cherry Blossom and Double Dealing Character and as a playable character in several games, including Phantasmagoria of Flower View, Touhou Hisoutensoku and even her own spin-off game Fairy Wars.[1]  On June 13th, 2017, Redditor TheLastMemeWizard[1] posted the first Sokkaposting image to /r/me_irl, gaining over 1,400 points in less than 24 hours (shown below).

Lagjur captioned the post "Pelea en el parlamento Ucraniano convertido en arte renacentista ^^," which translates to "Fight in the Ukrainian Parliament become Renaissance Art ^^." The image (shown below) received more than 246 likes and 880 shares. Four days later, in an article about the photograph, the Guardian[2] referred to the picture as "Accidental Renaissance." "It's a surprise tool that will help us later" is a line from the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse cartoon series, which premiered on May 6th, 2006.[1] On the show, a computer generated Mickey Mouse uses a mechanical assistant named the "Mouseketool," which gives him various items for problem solving. Because the show is an interactive educational one for early-childhood learning, Mickey often asks the audience what tool should be used. One tool is usually kept a mystery until later in the show, which leads Mickey to say the line. Among the earliest iterations of picture as a meme comes from the Facebook meme account Eres Todo Un Loquillo.[2] In the image (shown below), Mickey Mouse is subtitled saying, "It's a surprise tool that will help us later." The caption says, "Why are you buying condoms? Aren't we going to the movies?" The post received more than 24,000 reactions and 6,100 shares. The original two pics came from Twitter user @princessofwifi,[1] who on April 24th, 2016, posted the two images with a caption about wanting to sleep early, only to sleep very late (shown below). The character first appeared in a 1920 agitprop[2] (a portmanteau of "agitation" and "propaganda") poster by Vladimir Mayakovsky,[4] a Soviet poet and artist, for the Russian Telegraph Agency or ROSTA.[1][2][3] ROSTA was the state news agency in Soviet Russia from 1918-1935, for which Mayakovsky contributed satirical window cartoons, featuring panels that espoused pro-Soviet ideology. The one featuring Porky (shown below) sees the character reacting to a worker being absent from work and performing his duty. The poster translates to "Every absence is the joy of enemies, but hero of labour is a blow against bourgeois." The Missile copypasta can be found on the internet as early as 2003, according to the Wayback Machine archive for an obscure page on the University of Wyoming website, Titled "Missile Guidance for Dummies"[1].The page links to a pdf called “Association of Air Force Missileers,” with the original text for the Missile copypasta found on page 5[2]. As well as the text, the website links to an audio recording reading the specific passage. The transcription for the audio is as follows: The missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't. By subtracting where it is from where it isn't, or where it isn't from where it is (whichever is greater), it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn't, and it follows that the position that it was, is now the position that it isn't. In the event that the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn't, the system has acquired a variation, the variation being the difference between where the missile is, and where it wasn't. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too may be corrected by the GEA. However, the missile must also know where it was. The missile guidance computer scenario works as follows. Because a variation has modified some of the information the missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it is. However, it is sure where it isn't, within reason, and it knows where it was. It now subtracts where it should be from where it wasn't, or vice-versa, and by differentiating this from the algebraic sum of where it shouldn't be, and where it was, it is able to obtain the deviation and its variation, which is called error. The earliest known variation of the game can be found in the 1948 short story The Wish by Roald Dahl, which features a child who imagines the carpet as red hot coals and dangerous snakes. On October 6th, 2002, the webcomic Toothpaste For Dinner[10] uploaded a comic featuring a man standing on a table with the caption "The floor is made of lava!" The comic that grew associated with "cock waffle" is dated June 8th, 2007. It was posted by Furaffinity user ~Deimion_J_ShadowWolf.[7][8] It was later uploaded to Furnation on August 6th, 2007[2] by foxi girl, then reposted on March 3rd, 2008 on a Rule 34 board.[3] On June 5th, 2017, the Exploding Fish Shitposting and Senseless Drivel, Inc.Facebook[2] page posted a Baton Roue comic in which the bike rider says "i feel the urge for a very expensive milkshake right now," announcing that "very expensive milkshake" was a "new meme" (shown below). On June 12th, 2016, Twitter user @pixelatedboat[1] posted a tweet about the internet's love for "Milkshake Duck," followed by the revelation "we regret to inform you the duck is racist" (shown below).

Within two months, the post gained over 7,600 shares and 4,500 reactions. The earliest usage of the phrase "Y'all Need Jesus" can be found in a Washington Post article entitled "Rap Gets Religion, But Is It Gospel?" from September 24th, 2004. Discussing the Kanye West song "Jesus Walks," the article misquotes West, writing out the lyrics "The way Kathie Lee needed Regis that's the way I need Jesus"[1] as "The way Kathie Lee needed Regis / That's the way y'all need Jesus."[2] "What's New Pussycat?" was written for the film of the same name and released on June 5th, 1965.[1] It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1966, but lost to "The Shadow of Your Smile."

The Twitter account @SeinfeldToday was created in December 2012 by Los Angeles-based writer Jack Moore[3] and New York-based comedian Josh Gondelman.[4] The tweets typically keep in line with Seinfeld’s “postmodern” elements and the main characters’ strange quirks, however, with a unique twist of various technological advancements that were made after the finale of the series in 1998. The account’s first tweet (shown below) projects that Cosmo Kramer, the main character’s eccentric neighbor, would find someone with his name on Twitter and become preoccupied with their life. Additionally, Newman, the main character’s arch-nemesis, would get weight loss surgery that fails. As of September 2013, the account has made more than 420 tweets and has gained more than 644,000 followers.

Some of the insects there start trying to take over the world with their new-found powers. These people, called the "Herd Army", are caught by a group called the "Resistance", where the protagonist Buck serves. The goal of the game is to beat the evil Herd Army and defeat the Queen. [5] The game was published by Ubi Soft Entertainment in America on September 30, 1998, and in Japan and Europe on December 18, 1998, to average and positive reviews.[6] Gamespot gave the game a 5.2/10, and EGM gave it a 6.62/10.[7][8] IGN gave it a 7.2/10, and Nintendo Power gave the game a 8.2/10.[9][10] One of the most frequent mentions of the reviewers was of the theme song, which was created by artist Justin Scharvona (shown below).[11] On March 23rd, 2017, cartoonist J.L.

On November 16th, 1900, the Thomas Edison-produced The Enchanted Drawing (shown below) became first film to mix animation and live-action filmed sequences. Because it was the first film to contain animated images over live-action film, the short's director J. Stuart Blackton is often considered the father of American animation.[3] The process of combining real life footage with animated characters or objects is called "rotoscoping."[4] Developed in 1915 by Max Fleischer, the first animated film to use the technique was the Out of the Inkwell series. Fleischer produced these Out of the Inkwell cartoons from 1918 to 1929. Fleischer accomplished this technique by tracing over footage frame by frame.

While the exact date the poem was first published is unclear, the earliest times Niemoller used variations of the text are traced back to 1946.[1] The version of the text that appears in the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum reads: First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out-- Because I was not a Socialist. Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out-- Because I was not a Trade Unionist. Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out-- Because I was not a Jew. Then they came for me--and there was no one left to speak for me.

Tumblr user ichigoflavor uploaded the original photoset, which featured a demon as the image the man saw, gaining over 128,000 notes (shown below). Though the post has since been deleted, memearchives[1] traces its origin date to June 25th, 2013. On April 4th, 2010, YouTuber mittdawson uploaded a video titled "1988 Crystal Light National Aerobic Championship Opening" (shown below). Within seven years, the video accumulated upwards of 3.8 million views and 160 comments. On May 24th, 2017, Sony Pictures released a series of posters in promotion of the Marvel superhero film Spider-Man: Homecoming. However, one of the images (shown below) became the subject of criticism on Twitter. The poster, which features all of the major cast, including Tom Holland, Robert Downey, Jr., Zendaya, Marisa Tomei and Jon Favreau, pays homage to the style of poster designer Drew Struzan, made famous for his work on the Star Wars and Indana Jones films.[1] Despite this, people online came to the consensus that the poster was too busy, contained too many characters, and displayed poor design. On May 19th, 2017, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s photographer, Adam Scotti, posted a photograph of Trudeau jogging through a group of students taking prom pictures in Vancouver (shown below) on Twitter.[2] The photobombing went viral, and Scotti’s post received more than 1,500 likes on Instagram[1] and 1,700 retweets and 7,500 likes on Twitter within three days. On December 24th, 2014, Instagram user turangalila_[1] posted the earliest known iteration of the meme: An iPhone playing the Kanye West album Yeezus into a pair of headphones connected to a pregnant woman's stomach (shown below). The user captioned the photograph "Shhh. I told her it was Mozart. #yeezytaughtme #hypedad." Within 126 weeks, the post has received more than 1,300 likes. On May 24th, the Trump family visited Pope Francis in the Vatican. The visit came after a history of Pope Francis and Donald Trump disagreeing on several issues, including global warming and immigration. After what has been reported as a reasonably friendly visit,[1] the Pope posed for a photo op with the Trump family. In the picture, he is seen looking unhappy while Trump has a big grin, leading Twitter users to interpret the photo to mean the Pope was miserable in jokes about the photo (shown below).    The image was first posted to Tumblr sometime in August of 2014 by user daemontool with the caption "straight people are terrifying they can go as far as to give the girl skeleton a pair of bone titties to indicate its a straight relationship." Though the original post has since been deleted, the earliest known reblog of the post was done on August 7th by user pinkglimmers (shown below).[2] It has received over 283,000 notes. "Redbone" is the second single off Awaken, My Love! and was released on November 17th, 2016.[1] The song is Gambino's most successful single to date and his first top 40 single.

On May 14th, 2017, Twitter user @chloestixx tweeted a remix of the song where the audio was heavily muted, captioning it "What Redbone would sound like while you're making out in the bathroom of a house party." Her tweet gained over 85,400 retweets and 195,900 likes (shown below). What Redbone would sound like while you're making out in the bathroom of a house party pic.twitter.com/1X4T7jFvZc The phrase comes from a famous riddle that dates back to an unknown time. The riddle is, "A cowboy rides into town on Friday, stays in town for 3 days, then leaves on Friday. How did he do it?" The answer to the riddle is the said phrase, "The horse's name was friday". The riddle was made popular after it was mentioned in the episode "iGive Away a Car" of iCarly, [4][1] a web show and tv show aired on Nickelodeon .[5] (Third riddle in the video) Since the widespread of the riddle, netizens often use the phrase "The horse's name was friday" to answer other riddles or questions when they do not know the actual answer. Reaction images have also been created on Meme Generator[2] and Memecrunch[3] respectively. The term is also occasionally mentioned when something related to "horse" is brought up in a post for no apparent reason, such as this post on iFunny.  On May 17th, Facebook page El rincón de la curiosidad.[1] posted an image of a woman posing with a large dog, a cross between a German Shepard and a wolf (shown below.. In response, user Clemente Miranda posted a picture of his dog, the "Chilaquil," a cross between two breeds that is only allowed in "marginal colonies like mine." His comment, shown below, gained over 11,000 likes and reactions. The comment also gained over 1,300 replies.    On May 10th, 2017, musician and animator Bill Wurtz released history of the entire world, i guess, a YouTube video documenting the chain of events that make up the history of the planet Earth. The video has garnered more than 17.7 million views in less than two weeks (shown below). Three minutes into the video, when Wurtz begins discussing the first lifeforms to inhabit land, he sings: "Can we go on land? No. Why? The sun is a deadly laser." The origin of the hoax is a response to an AskReddit thread titled "What did your parents show you to do that you assumed was completely normal, only to later discover that it was not normal at all?" On December 27th, 2014, user Raregan replied, "My parents never believed in Finland, I grew up to never believe in Finland until I researched it further. It's a pretty heated topic in my family."[1] When pressed as to why, he provided the full details of the conspiracy (shown below). His comments gained 5,586 and 6,718 points, respectively. Oh God here goes. Well firstly they say that the actual 'place of Finland' is just Eastern Sweden. Helsinki is in Eastern Sweden and when people fly there it's not like they would notice. World maps are altered as it's a U.N conspiracy to keep people believing in Finland. And the idea that an entire country is made up seems so bizarre that nobody would ever believe it, making it easy to do. Finland's main company, Nokia, is apparently owned by the Japanese and they're a main player in this. Now as for 'why' people would want to invent Finland as a country that's a bit more in depth and there's a few reasons as to why Sweden and Russia go along with it but it's mostly to do with Japanese fishing rights. You see the Japanese love their sushi but tight fishing regulations and public outcry mean they can't fish as much as they want. So after the Cold War they agreed with Russia to create a 'landmass' called Finland where they could fish. After all, if people thought there was a country there nobody would expect the Japanese to be harpooning whales would they? The fish is then transported through Russia where a small percentage of the food is given to the population, (they were of course starving at the time of Finland being invented), and then is shipped to Japan under the disguise of 'Nokia' products. Japan is apparently one of the worlds largest importers of Nokia products despite the fact that 'nobody there owns a Nokia phone' apparently. The crux of all this however, and my favourite part, is the homage that the Japanese gave to this entire conspiracy theory. What do fish have? Fins. Therefore they named their imaginary country Finland. There are loads more that they go on about but I can't remember it all at the moment. EDIT: Thanks for the Gold! I'm amazed how big this has gotten, I told my parents and although they don't really understand Reddit they're glad that the 'truths' being put out there for people to make their own decision. In January of 2014, Lund orchestrated a hoax in which he convinced some that he had been hired by political blog Slate as a blogger.[1] On the 23rd, he tweeted "I am just so honored and overwhelmed to be @Slate's first candidate to field a general blogger role. It is humbling and exciting."[2] Unaware Lund was not sincere, Mediabistro linked to his tweet for their Revolving Door newsletter, which reports on new hires by media outlets.[1] This led to confusion as to whether or not Lund had actually been hired, which Lund contributed to by continuing to tweet as though he had been hired by Slate (ex: shown below). On June 9th, Twitter user and Vice politics editor Harry Cheadle[3] referenced the moment by congratulating Mobute for joining Libertarian blog Reason, which he wasn't (shown below). This marked the first "Congratulations @Mobute" joke. On July 26th, 2014, Redditor Brian_Buckley[1] posted a picture (shown below) of a person in a Elmo costume appearing to "catch" a person dressed as Woody taking a picture with a tourist in New York City's Times Square. They posted the picture in the /r/photoshopbattles subreddit, garnering more than 1,800 points (96% upvoted) and 130 comments.  The song was first released on May 21st, 1979 under Epic Records. It was Billboard's 50th top song overall for 1979[2] and was in the top 10 for seven weeks and in the top 40 for 12 weeks.[3] The song itself describes the Devil as needing a soul, and challenges a fiddler named Johnny to see who plays better. If Johnny wins, the Devil will give him a golden fiddle, but if he loses, the Devil get's his soul. Despite the Devil being known to manipulate, cheat and lie in most stories where he is involved, Johnny wins the contest by simply playing better and wins the Golden Fiddle without no strings attached.  On May 14th, 2017, Blitzer tweeted[1] a picture of a turtle captioned "Always nice to see a turtle." The tweet gained nearly 4,000 retweets and 12,000 likes (shown below, left).

It gained large popularity on the app by shitposting and repub bait, but outside the app the meme is not that popular. On May 17th, 2017, Piers Morgan interviewed a gender non-binary couple on Good Morning Britain (shown below). During the interview, Piers conducted the talk with his arms crossed. Following the interview, Twitter user @joegolby[1] tweeted a screenshot of Piers (shown below) from the show with the caption "'well i'm sorry madame but it simply won't do. we asked for butter and this is clearly margarine. we shan't be settling the bill.'" The tweet received more than 300 retweets and 1,200 likes.

Within two years, the page garnered upwards of 102,000 likes. On April 13th, 2015, Tumblr used the phrase in video in reference to hate mail she was receiving (shown below).[1] The full text of her video reads: Nigga…It’s April 2015, and y'all motherfuckers still sending me anonymous hate mail like I give a fuck. Nigga, do you know that there is an “ignore” button right next to the trash icon? And I will ignore yo’ ass, okay? My edges are still full, bitch. My skin is still clear, bitch. Okay? My ass is still round. My personality is still blessed. Whether you find me attractive or not is not my problem. Okay? Find Jesus. "I'm Mary Poppins, y'all" is a line from the Marvel sci-fi action film Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, which premiered on April 10th, 2017.[1] In the film, the character Yondu (Michael Rooker) uses his arrow to fly next to the character Peter Quill (Chris Pratt). As he's flying, Peter and Yondu have the following exchange:[2] Mary Poppins is the title character from the 1964 Disney film Mary Poppins. Played by Julie Andrews, Poppins is a magical nanny, who has the ability to fly by opening her umbrella and floating into the air.[3] Yondu's body language in the scene, his hand held straight up into the sky, resembles Poppins'. The romphim is a product of ACED Design, who began promoting their product on Instagram on April 9th, 2017.[1] The group used the Instagram to promote their product at various events such as Coachella and the Kentucky Derby in the following month.

That day, the @SaudiEmbassyUSA[1] Twitter feed posted a photograph of the men touching the globe in which many of the countries were obscured by their hands (shown below). The question of Steven Universe's conception has puzzled fans, as it's not directly addressed by the show. His biological father is Greg and his "geological mother" is Rose Quartz, a Crystal Gem who gave up her physical form to give birth to Steven.[1] This led to the theory that by having sex with Rose, Greg essentially murdered her, hence the nickname "Murdercock." While the first reference to Greg as a "Murdercock" is unknown, comments using the term date back as early as April 2015 on Funnyjunk.[2] The phrase takes its name from the act of drinking a shot of alcohol with a chaser, something used to cleanse the mouth from the taste of alcohol. In the context of journalism, the earliest known iteration comes from The National Journal's The Hotline feature.[1] The feature started in 1987, but a running column called "Last Call," Hotline's final news round up feature of the day, founded in August 7th, 1998,[2] became known for its "Shot… Chaster…" segments, a humorous way of presenting news. The earliest example found on Internet Archive "The Wayback Machine" is from August 21st, 2008.[3]  On September 14th, 2008, Urban Dictionary[9] user Daemion submitted an entry for "dependapotamus," defined as a "stay at home mom" who looks "remarkably similar to Jabba the Hut" (shown below).

Answers user Tuggy posed the question, "I was bitten by a turtle when I was a young lad, should I still drink orange juice?" For additional information, they said "I need to know ya'll. I love to drink that dang OJ. It be tasting very good to me." Ostensibly, they were trolling.

At the beginning of the 1929 film Man with a Movie Camera directed by Sovet filmmaker Dziga Vertov, a statement is displayed referring to "absolute kinography" as an "absolute language of cinema": "This new experimental work by Kino-Eye is directed towards the creation of an authentically international absolute language of cinema – ABSOLUTE KINOGRAPHY – on the basis of its complete separation from the language of theatre and literature." On 4chan, kino is often used as shorthand for kinography as a joke classification for the highest tier of film, followed by "cinema," "film," "movie," "flick" and "joint." As early as September 2014, a copypasta containing a "superior patrician ranking" of films began circulating on /tv/, featuring "Absolute Kinography" at the top (shown below).[6] ABSOLUTE KINOGRAPHY 1.

On December 1st, 2015, the video game Rainbow Six: Siege was released.[1] In the game, each "Operative" has a cinematic introduction, which includes a description of their traits (video below). During the intro for one operator named Thatcher, a British S.A.S operative, the character says in a thick British accent: GPS satellites, unmanned drones, fucking laser sights. The more crutches you have, the more it hurts when they're kicked out from under you. If there's one thing I know for sure, it's that a six inch blade never loses reception. One December 2nd, YouTuber Ekopingviini uploaded the video of Thatcher's intro. As of July 2017, the video has received more than 175,000 views.[2] References to The Resistance and the hashtag #Resist began appearing immediately following Trump's victory in the 2016 Presidential Election. Moments after the The New York Times began predicting Trump's victory, Twitter users began using the hashtag #Resist on November 8th, 2016. One of the first viral pieces of criticism came by way of The New Yorker's David Remnick, whose piece "An American Tragedy"[1] went viral on November 9th. Pikachu was first designed by Ken Sugimori for the Pokemon Red / Green Version games, released for the Game Boy handheld system on February 27, 1996.[1] The Pokémon that was originally chosen the be the series' mascot was Clefairy, but Pikachu was ultimately chosen due to its popularity in the anime series.[2] In the anime, Ash goes to meet Professor Oak and receive his first Pokémon, though he arrives late, and Bulbasaur, Charmander and Squirtle have been taken. Oak gives Pikachu to Ash. Pikachu is cold to Ash initially but the two develop a bond over the course of the series. Peladophin is the origin.  The (Male) suffix started with a doujin manga (Make A Matchless ♂ Succubus Masochistic!!!/サキュバス♂を絶倫で虜にする!! by Gujira) where a succubus with a male genital visited a college student during the night. Because of its questionable nature, debates around website dedicated to discussing Chinese Cartoon and Comics such as le4chins, Gay-ia Online and Pinterest starts arguing whether it is proper to call him a Succubus (Since he still fits the role of seducing men) or an incubus (Since he is a boy) The line comes from the end of the movie, released on October 13th, 2016 (November 4th for the US release), in a scene in which Doctor Strange (played by Benedict Cumberbatch) is facing Dormammu, one of the movie's villains and a powerful magic creature. In the climactic scene (extract from it shown below, uploaded to YouTube in March 2017), Doctor Strange is seen preparing himself before facing Dormammu by creating a green magic glyph. He then greets the creature by saying "Dormammu, I've come to bargain" and gets killed after a brief exchange. The scene seems then to rewind back in time to the moment Strange delivered his catchphrase before playing it again and again with different death scenes, trapping his enemy into an endless time loop which eventually allows him to have his bargain, asking for the creature to leave Earth and never attack it again.   The earliest known use of "daddy" in nonfamilial and sexual context can be attributed to the term "sugar daddy," a man who spends money for the benefit of a relationship with an often younger sexual partner, which has been documented in publications since as early as the 1920s, according to Google Ngram Viewer. The colloquialization of "sugar daddy" accelerated with the sexual liberation of the 1970s, while the emergence of leather fashion, LGBT movement and BDSM subculture gave rise to the term "leather daddy," which describe the leather-clad older male who assumes the dominant role in a sadomasochistic relationship. In the early 1990s, the term "pimp daddy" came into popular usage with the rising popularity of hip hop music centered around pimp culture. When No One Understands You uploaded by Jordan Underneath depicts a pair of plushies talking about their music tastes and when one of them asks for Jordan's opinion, Jordan plays wite noise using a radio, after one of the plushies ask Jordan to stop Jordan interrupts him saying that it is his favirite part, followed by louder white noise.

The instruments include the piano, the flute, the trumpet and the euphonium (shown below, left). On April 20, 2017, YouTube user Doodley uploaded a video called "i put spongebob music over that useless $400 juicer," which has over 501,936 views as of May 9, 2017. The video was a remix of the infamous "Juicero: Making Juice is Easy" video whilst "Tomfoolery" played in the background, lampooning the Juicero Juicer Controversy by further emphasizing how nonsensical and absurd the concept of the juicer was (shown below, right). Originally, most successful "I called" videos were those centered around the devil.[1] They generally did not have the "and he answered" part and were popular as far back as 2014. On October 28th, 2014, YouTuber "lillians_ kinda comedy" posted "1-666-666-6666 some one acually picked up" (shown below) which to date has over 2 million views.  "What's Your Type" is based on a three-panel webcomic (shown below) by Tumblr artist K009[1], which was published on on July 6th, 2014[2]. Unlike variations of the meme, the original second panel features the names of different fictional characters, representing the man's "type." By May 2017, the comic has received more than 9,300 notes. The scene comes from 2011's X Men: First Class. Raven Darkhölme (Jennifer Lawrence), aka Mystique, a mutant with shapeshifting powers, attempts to seduce Erik by showing herself to him as a beautiful blonde woman (Rebecca Romijn). Erik responds by saying "I prefer the real Raven." Raven then shifts into the human form she usually presents to others. Erik presses, "I said the real Raven." Raven then turns into her natural blue form, to which Erik replies "Perfection." On October 14th of that year, user jstupack uploaded the first variation of the exploitable to /r/funny.[1] In the post, Raven turns into actress Raven Symone before Erik says, "Perfection." The post gained 645 points (shown below).  In September of 2016, the first image macro to include Hugh Neutron captioned "Wuss Poppin Jimbo" began to appear on iFunny. On September 18th, 2016, iFunny user @OKendrickLlamaO[1] published the earliest known post of the picture to the site (shown below). However, because iFunny dates comments but not posts, it is possible the image was posted earlier. On August 26th, 2016, comedian Brandon Wardell tweeted a video in which he said it was "respecting women hours," in reference to the meme "real nigga hours" (shown below). it's. tru. gd. mf. respecting. women. hours pic.twitter.com/UTkEjlFAqH In 2006 and early 2008, The Starbucks' company reintroduced a revamped version of their original brown logo of the twin-tailed Siren.[1][2][3][4] The logo featured the full-body of the Siren in a Navasana pose, topless, with her upper body covered in flowing hair, leaving only her naval visible. In response to the change, many Christian groups boycotted the company for having, On March 10th, 2017, Twitter user @uejini [5], a.k.a Gashi-gashi [6], posted an anime-like illustration of the siren based off her Navasana pose within the logo along with the caption, "i love coffee". The post accumulated 49 comments, 1.2k shares and 4.7k likes over the past months. Two days after the original image was posted, @uejini posted another illustration of STB-chan holding a coffee cup with the phrase, "Drink it," in the foreground. "Steamed Hams" comes from a scene in the Simpsons episode "22 Short Films About Springfield," which first aired on April 14th, 1996.[1] In the episode, which is an anthology of 22 short scenes about several of the citizens of Springfield, the character Principal Skinner has Superintendent Chalmers over for dinner in a play on the "dinner with the boss" sitcom trope (shown below).[2] The dinner, as per the trope, does not go according to plan, as Skinner burns dinner, leading him to cover the truth about dinner through elaborate and increasingly unbelievable series of lies. After burning dinner and telling Chalmers that he's making "steamed clams" for dinner, Skinner attempts to convince Chalmers that what he had prepared "steamed hams" for dinner, an expression for hamburgers, he says, which is native to Albany, New York.[3] Principal Skinner: Superintendent, I hope you're ready for mouth-watering hamburgers. Superintendent Chalmers: I thought we were having steamed clams. Principal Skinner: Oh, no, I said, "steamed hams." That's what I call hamburgers. Superintendent Chalmers: You call hamburgers steamed hams. Principal Skinner: Yes, it's a regional dialect. Superintendent Chalmers: Uh-huh. What region? Principal Skinner: Uh, upstate New York. Superintendent Chalmers: Really. Well, I'm from Utica and I never heard anyone use the phrase, "steamed hams." Principal Skinner: Oh, not in Utica, no; it's an Albany expression. Superintendent Chalmers: I see. While the line has been quoted by fans since the episode aired, one of the earliest examples of it being used online comes from a November 15th, 2007 Urban Dictionary post by user Delaware Mike,[4] who defines "Steamed Hams" as: Hamburgers. An Albany, New York expression, its not to be confused with steamed clams. The earliest known iterations comes from the Facebook group "Dank Memes for Edgy Teens," a Facebook meme page, which launched on May 20th, 2015.[1] The page's about section reads, "There are teenagers in the world today that threaten suicide and don't know the grace of a rare Pepe. Won't you save a life today by sending a dank meme?" In two years, the page has amassed more than 1,300 likes and 1,300 followers. Anthropomorphism has existed in human cultures since prehistory. On the Internet, one of the earliest examples of Moe Anthropomorphism is the Japanese artist Toy's "iMac Girl" (left), which portrays the iMac model of Apple desktop computers as a woman. According to Toy's website, the art was first published in 1998. In 2003, the character ME-tan (right), a personification of the Windows ME operating system, was created on the Japanese imageboard Futaba Channel, which spawned the OS-tan series of Windows-oriented moe anthropomorphism. The etymology of the term "moe" remains unknown and disputed. One of the more prominent theories behind the term's origin points to the Japanese word for "budding," as with a plant that is about to flower. According to Nomura Research Institute's Ken Kitabayashi, the slang term is a pun with the Japanese verb for "to sprout" ( (萌える, moeru) and its homonym "to burn" (燃える, moyasu), in the sense of one's heart burning with passion. Another theory asserts that its usage stems from 2channel in the 1990s when the word was used to refer to female characters who were "hybrids of the Lolicon (lolita complex) and bishoujo (beautiful girls) genres," Hotaru Tomoe from Sailor Moon being an early example of a moekko character. In an article written by Patrick W. Galbraith of Tokyo University [1], Galibraith explores the origins and meanings behind the term "moe". He states that the term originated from 2channel in the 1990s in the discussion of young, cute, and innocent girls and their burning passion for them. This term likely picked up because moeru (nominalized as moe) while meaning 'to bud or sprout,', is homophonous with the verb 'to burn.' The sexualization of underage (or underage-looking) characters in manga goes back to the late '70s, when underground and adult manga artists such as Disappearance Diary creator Hideo Azuma began to work around censorship laws by drawing characters without pubic hair. This was the beginning of the lolicon (Lolita Complex) trend;  On May 2nd, 2017, Complex uploaded an episode of "Everyday Struggle" in which Lil Yachty was the guest on a panel featuring DJ Academiks and Joe Budden to YouTube. [1] In the episode, Budden challenged Lil Yachty to explain the cover for his album Teenage Emotions that features him alongside a group of "outsider" teenagers such as an albino, a homosexual couple, and more (shown below). Budden stated that when he saw the album cover, he felt "a bit jaded" and wondered what the message was. Lil Yachty responded the message is "to believe in yourself; to love yourself… I'm an outcast of the hip-hop game. These are all outcasts on this cover." Budden responded "That's bullshit," and further challenged Lil Yachty, "You are happy 24/7? That is a lie." That day, Complex tweeted the relevant clip from the episode (shown below). ❤️ lilyachty</a> on his inclusive album cover: &quot;The message is to believe in yourself, to love yourself.&quot; <a href="https://t.co/0ML3c14btl">https://t.co/0ML3c14btl</a> <a href="https://t.co/kNXqFEjmq2">pic.twitter.com/kNXqFEjmq2</a></p>&mdash; Complex (Complex) May 2, 2017 The phrase can be heard at 5:47 in the original interview on YouTube. He used the phrase "issa knife" when asked what the "cross" on his head signified. In many single player and online games, players can unlock new skins for their characters by progressing in the game, completing achievements or purchasing with in-game currency. On May 1st, Redditor _Meme_Sauce submitted photographs of Adolf Hitler wearing two different colored outfits with the caption "When you unlock a new skin for your character" to /r/dankmemes[2], where it received more than 2,900 points (98% upvoted) within 48 hours (shown below). "I have the high ground" is a line from the 2005 film Star Wars: Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith. During the film's climax, in which the characters Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) duel on the fire planet Mustafar, Obi-Wan leaps over Anakin's head and onto a nearby hill. There he yells, "It's over, Anakin. I have the high ground." The line has become a fan favorite inspiring memes, jokes, and other media. One of the earliest iterations comes by way of a Lego-themed webcomic on the website Irregular Webcomic,[1] published February 24th, 2006 (shown below). Among the first versions of the line as a meme is a Demotivational Poster,. On November 9th, 2009, Motifake user Bartimus[2] posted an image from the scene with the caption "You've Lost." On November 10th, 2015, Reddit user suctionpolecat uploaded an image macro of Bugs Bunny from Looney Toons holding a gun accompanied with the phrase "Lord Forgive Me But Its Time To Go Back To The Old Me" to /r/terriblefacebookmemes.[1] This suggests the image appeared on Facebook before suctionpolecat's post, but has likely since been deleted. The post gained 102 points (shown below). On April 27th, artist Superelmer posted a comic in which a character is bullied by figures labeled "Problems", "Stress" and "Pain," who is subsequently embraced by a yellow figure named "Sleep" (shown below). Within two weeks, the post gained over 138,000 shares, 45,000 reactions and 1,800 comments. In Star Wars Episode III, Chancellor Palpatine is approached by Mace Windu who intends to arrest him. After telling the Chancellor, "The senate will decide your fate," Palpatine replies, "I am the Senate" (shown below). In the 1990s, the term "flamebait" was used on Usenet to describe posts made specifically to incite an argument. One of the earliest examples of this was posted to the rec.autos.tech[2] newsgroup on August 20th, 1995, in response to a complaint that American-made cars used soft suspensions and automatic transmissions that made Americans look weak and incompetent. After the poster went on to complain that the United States was spending money that they thought should have been allotted for healthcare and education on the military, another user referred to the comments as "flamebait." On May 1st, 2017, artist Mike Mitchell tweeted several photographs of Trump with a green frog painted over his mouth and chin (shown below). Within one week, the original tweet gained over 31,600 likes and 14,300 retweets.[1]  According to Wikipedia, Timothy Draper, founder of the global capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson, is often credited with coining the term “viral marketing.” (when?) Meanwhile, American media theorist Douglas Rushkoff was among the first scholars to explore the concept of viral marketing on the Internet in his 1996 book Media Virus! Hidden Agendas in Popular Culture[2] in Popular Culture.[2] In July 2016, Bright Side published a series of comics juxtaposing various scenarios comparing the perspective of "ordinary people" with "creative people," depicting creative people as viewing the world through a fantastical lens (shown below). "You probably didn't recognize me because of the red arm" is a quote from the 2015 film Star Wars: The Force Awakens. In the film, C-3PO interrupts a reunion between former lovers Han Solo and Princess Leia. However, C-3PO mistakes Solo's surprise to see Leia, who is standing directly behind the droid, for his inability to recognize C-3PO, which he blames on his new, mysterious red arm. Much speculation has been made about the origins of C-3PO's red arm, and Disney answered the mystery in a 2016 comic book set before the events of The Force Awakens. According to Uproxx:[1] It turns out he gets the arm from the Imperial droid he’s been escorting, who sacrifices itself to protect him and let Threepio fulfill his mission. The droid is sick of the memory wipes, the lack of free will, and the actions it has to take, and makes the only decision it’s really allowed to. The arm, it turns out, is a memory of sacrifice from an unlikely friend, and a tribute to what Threepio, of all characters, has to struggle with. On April 30th, 2016, Redditor Marcusbolt[4] posted one of the earliest Red Arm memes to the Star Wars-themed subreddit /r/PrequelMemes. In this image (shown below), Obi-Wan Kenobi confronts General Grevious and reveals that he has a red arm. The post received more than 4,200 points (95% upvoted) and 100 comments in 24 hours. On September 29th, 2013, @dril tweeted:[1] Food $200 Data $150 Rent $800 Candles $3,600 Utility $150 someone who is good at the economy please help me budget this. my family is dying His tweet gained over 53,000 retweets and 74,000 likes in three and a half years (shown below).

Toro Max is the star of several YouTube videos uploaded by his father, Chuy Marlboro. According to reports, Toro passed away in 2015, and his father began uploading videos to honor his son's memory.[1] These videos have since been pulled off Instagram. However, one mirror of the original video uploaded by YouTuber : y on October 26, 2016 has more than 1.2 million views (shown below, left).

However, the template image for Meme of the Month calendars was not posted until 2016, when Tumblr user ceruleanazura[2] posted a calendar for the first half of 2016 on June 9th of that year. The post, shown below, gained over 116,000 notes over the next nine months.  The Ratio began being noticed on Twitter in early 2017. On March 7th, Twitter user @85mf[1] tweeted a screenshot of a tweet by House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz which had 701 replies yet only 23 retweets and 108 likes.

Complex magazine claims that it originated in the Chicago Drill music community, and was first popularized by the local rapper Katie Got Bandz in her song "Ridin' Round and We Drillin,"(below left) released on March 12th, 2012.[2] On April 30th, 2012, another Chicago rapper named TKO released a single called "I Need a Thot" (below right). Also according to Complex, a man named Duan Gaines claims to have first heard the term on set for a video shoot with Chief Keef. He then began using it on social media, popularizing the term. According to Merriam-Webster, petty comes from the Middle English word "pety," an alteration of petit, meaning small or minor, first used in the 14th century.

The term "Mall Ninja" comes from a since-deleted 2001 thread on gun-owner forum Glock Talk. According to a March 1st, 2006 post on lonelymachines,[1] the term was first applied to Glock Talk poster Gecko45, who posted to the thread asking a question about being properly protected with a bullet proof vest. It was later revealed he was a very over-enthusiastic mall cop who always carried firearms and wore a bullet-proof vest, believing himself to be a potential target of a shooting at all times. When people in the thread mocked him, he responded by getting more defensive (ex: below; bolded emphasis added). I do not understand the “joke” or the “Rambo.” I am in a high-risk job. It is not the Mall of America, but Ill tell you what its no podunk mall either.I am a responsible citizen who has made the choice to carry at all times. I defend others. If something happens at the Mall then I would be the hero, not those of you who are making fun of me for no reason. Yes Im not a Green Beret but guess what neither are you and unlike you I have to face unruly shoppers every day.My REAL problem is that, like any LEO, I have enemies because of my job. They may have access to high-powered rifles. My job starts and ends at the same time every day. Although I use four rotating routes to drive to and from work, I am still vulnerable during the walk to and from my car. This is the time that I load up on the trauma plates because I DO NOT WANT TO BE SHOT DEAD! Also, someone said that my Tac Team doesn’t get training. Not true. We meet at the range every night and shoot 400 rounds each through weapons that closely resemble our duty setup. We also practice unarmed combat. I am a Master of three martial arts including ninjitsu, which means I can wear the special boots to climb walls. I don’t think any of you are working as hard as I am to be prepared. I asked a serious question about tactical armor and I wanted a serious response. If you want to laugh at somebody, try laughing at the sheep out there who go to the mall unarmed trusting in me to stand guiard over their lives like a God. He would later go on to claim that in an operation, he saved the life and "possibly the virginity" of the mayor's nephew, but the mayor had paid off the press so there was no scandal. Further posters chimed in in response to Gecko45 posts, though many in the thread suspected these were alternate accounts Gecko45 created to corroborate his story. On April 26th, 2017, Redditor pheonixs1234[1] posted "Google could be lying about how many search results it gives, noone's going to actually check that far" to the subreddit /r/Showerthoughts.

According to the band, while performing the song at one of their first shows, the crowd began chanting the line, inspiring the creation of the song.[3] "Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell" began circulating online in 2008[2] and began generating interest over the following two years. In June 2009, the group was interviewed by The Village Voice and talked about the creation of the song, and said: "The line actually comes from an older song of mine called "I Zimbra," and at one of our first shows, we were doing that song and then just started repeating that line over and over, and people seemed to like it, because people seem to like dumb shit. I know I like dumb shit. We did it in one take on the same mic in our friend's basement like a week later. There are always a number of substances involved." It was later included on Das Racist's 2010 debut mixtape, Shut Up, Dude.  The quote originates from the Spider-Man 2 video game released in June 2004.

According to Charlie, he has been receiving mail for a person named "Pepe Silvia," who he believes does not exist (scene shown below).  According to Merriam-Webster, the first known use of "bamboozle" was in 1703. According to Wikitionary,[2] it's an extension of the 17th century vernacular word "bam," which means to trick or con.

Normally they are used when one is referring to one's interlocutor, as using on oneself is often seen as arrogant. Dropping the honorific implies a high degree of intimacy and this action is often reserved for close friends, one's spouse, or social inferiors (for example, a teacher addressing his students). The honorifics fall into three different categories depending on the type of speech the speaker is using (shown below).

In the creepypasta, annie96 texts mcdavey and tells him there is a creepy man wearing his jacket in her garden. David calls the cops.

Shortly after the bill was announced, various Twitter users began mocking the proposal by tweeting two similar pictures next to each other, representing Obamacare as the better alternative to the "GOP Replacement." The first appears to have been tweeted by @morninggloria,[8] using the before-and-after pictures of Potato Jesus.

He piles up food onto a plastic plate, and then he suddenly takes off his shirt without explanation.

According to a Daily Dot[1] study of a variation on the phrase, "Whoa, if true!", first appeared on Twitter in 2008 (shown below). It began being parodied on Twitter in the mid-2010s as an in-joke for news Twitter types mocking posters tendency to spread shock at bombshell rumors while maintaining the caveat that what they are sharing might be false. Mentioning the present year has long been used by liberals as a rhetorical device to promote progressive agendas and dismiss conservative beliefs, particularly in the context of issue-specific political debates, with the earliest known online satire of the phrase attributed to an Onion article published in February 2014 with the headline "Report: Stating Current Year Still Leading Argument For Social Reform" (shown below, left). However, the phrase "I mean, come on people, it's [current year]" became a popular fodder for mockeries in late 2015 after it was recognized by users of 4chan as a signature line associated with John Oliver on his late-night TV talk show Last Week Tonight; the oldest 4chan parody of the expression as used by John Oliver can be found in a /tv/ (television & film) thread submitted on September 3rd, 2015 (shown below, right). On February 14th, 2017, The Scene published a video titled "Why Did You Cheat On Me?" in which Kourtney and Leonard, a couple who had dated each other for three years, talk about how infidelity affected their relationship. That same day, the video also entered circulation on Twitter via The Scene's official account, garnering nearly 221,900 retweets and 478,799 likes within the first week. The image of the cat is taken from a post on justcuteanimals.com (shown below, left).[1] It later gained some traction as "Wizard Cat" on me_irl following a post from April 2016 that referred to it as the High Wizard Cat (shown below, right). On November 6th, 2016, it made it's first appearance on Russian internet as "вжух" in a VK post by MiG,[6] who saw a Russian variation of the High Wizard Cat and shortened the image's message.[7]  On August 25th, 2012, Filthy Frank uploaded "HOW TO SAY HELLO IN 30 LANGUAGES." For his impression of how to say "hello" in many asian countries, the camera zooms in on him as he screams "Welcome to the rice fields, motherfucker!" The TV anime adaptation for the Japanese media franchise was aired between January and March 2017. Its opening song was written by a Japanese pop music singer/producer Masayoshi Oishi and sung by Animal Biscuits (どうぶつビスケッツ, Doubutsu Bisukettu) and PPP (pron. Pe-Pa-Pu). The former is a trio of main animal girls performed by Yuka Ozaki, Kana Motomiya and Saki Ono. The latter is a fictional penguin idol group Penguins Performance Project performed by Mikoi Sasaki, Ruka Nemoto, Kyoka Tamura, Aina Aiba and Ikuko Chikuta.  The first usage of the phrase "If You Are Cold They Are Cold" appears to have been from the Facebook page LoveAllAnimalsForever[1]. While the image (shown below) is no longer present on the page, it was likely posted around January 2013. The image advocates for bringing animals inside during cold temperatures. This image was later posted and used on other sites advocating for pet care[2]. On January 21st 2013, the Facebook page Angelic Dog Treats posted a similar image (shown below) with the phrase "If it's too cold for you it's too cold for your pet. Bring them inside."[4] On May 11th, 2013, Trivago released a commercial in which actor Tim Williams explains how to user Trivago search to find hotels (shown below). In April 2014, the @TrivagoGuy[5] parody account was launched on Twitter, featuring creepy tweets written from the perspective of Tim Williams as if he were an alcoholic (shown below).  On February 19th, 2017, an anonymous 4chan user took to /r9k/ to complain about popular YouTube channel "Behind the Meme," and ask how 4chan could take it down. In response, another user suggested that in every video, 4chan commenters demand he cover "Zenzi," a meme that doesn't exist, and downvote every video in which he doesn't cover Zenzi, which they thought would result in Behind The Meme getting frustrated and quitting (screenshot shown below). It appears the original thread has been deleted, though a similar thread has been archived.[1] On September 23rd, 2014, Tumblr account sandsvendor100 made its first post[1] introducing its character, Seymour the Tapir, who sells sands. This marked the first entry into the Sandsverse. Shortly after Seymour's debut, other blogs appeared contributing to the universe. Some of the first entrants to the universe include fruitsoftheape100, which is home of Elmer the fruit-selling proboscis monkey, fishboy100, home of a gravels and salts-selling fish, and boarofthenorth100, home of Horace.[2] In the 2016 Western Conference Finals, the Oklahoma City Thunder lost to the Warriors in seven games after blowing a 3-1 series lead (right before the Warriors would infamously do the same). On July 4th, 2016, after becoming an unrestricted free agent, Kevin Durant announced via an article entitled My Next Chapter[1] in The Players' Tribune that he was joining the Golden State Warriors after having spent his entire previous career with the Oklahoma City Thunder. The move was criticized by NBA fans, players, and commentators, as the Golden State Warriors were already the best team in the NBA and had just broken the regular season win record the previous year by going 73-9. This lead many to believe Durant signed with the Warriors because they were the easiest team for him to be a part of in order to win a championship. While the origin of the phrase is unknown, it has long been a part of conservative dialogue in an effort to expose liberal hypocrisy. For example, on October 30th, 2016, conservative blog Patheos published an article by Bristol Palin titled "Top 10 times the 'tolerant' Left wasn’t so tolerant,"[1] where it cited examples such as "When the Left rejoiced in the death of a constitutional lawyer and renowned conservative activist" (referring to the leftist celebration of the death of Phyllis Schlafly, who fought against things such as feminism and abortion) and "When black students refused to share residence with white people." On December 6th, 2013, an episode of GiantBomb series "Unprofessional Fridays" premiered.[5] In the episode, Drew Scanlon performs a "double take" reaction when Jeff Gerstmann says "farming with my hoe" while playing Starbound (shown below). The earliest known post to use the GIF of Scanlon was a comment by Tokubetsu responding to a comic about Kanye West and Future posted to a NeoGAF thread on July 27th, 2015.[1] The earliest known posting of the dog photograph was on the fitness blog MunFitness in a post titled "How to Help Your Dog Lose Weight with Slentrol" on October 25th, 2007 (shown below). On February 9th, 2017, Twitter user @_kbelijr[2] posted a screen captured image of O'Neal singing along with lyrics from the 2001 R&B song "Fallin'" by Alicia Keys (shown below). Within one week, the tweet garnered upwards of 43,000 likes and 36,000 retweets.  On February 13th, 2017, Ivanka Trump and Justin Trudeau sat next to one another at a roundtable discussion about female business leaders at the White House. During the meeting, Trump was photographed looking in Trudeau's direction. That day, Twitter user @Phil_Lewis_[3] tweeted several of the photos with the caption "Get you someone that looks at you the way Ivanka Trump looks at Justin Trudeau (shown below). Within 48 hours, the tweet gathered more than 44,000 likes and 22,000 retweets. On August 6th, 2008, BodyBuilding Forums member MayhemMaker submitted a post titled "'Mirin Legs" to the Teen Bodybuilding board, including a photograph of his exposed thighs (shown below).[1] In the Zombie Mode in the first person shooter Call of Duty: Black Ops downed players can revived other teammates. On January 29th, 2011, GameFAQs Forums[1] member mistahtom submitted a post complaining about children who beg for players to revive them because they are equipped with the Ray Gun weapon in Zombie Mode matches. On April 16th, 2013, SDPnoticias[1] reported a story in which a man was caught sexually abusing his father-in-law after drinking too much alcohol. Four months later, that story appeared to be referenced by Spanish Facebook page WTF,[2] who included the detail that the man intended to have sex with his wife's twin sister but ended up having sex with the dad.  On February 14th, 2017, The New York Times[1] reported that Donald Trump's campaign had been in contact with Russian intelligence officials a year prior to the election. While American intelligence officials had found no evidence that Trump's team had actively cooperated in the 2016 Presidential Election Hack, the report nevertheless raised alarms, particularly after the resignation of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn following reports that he had been in contact with Russians. The morning after the New York Times article was published, CNN political commentator tweeted a 5-step plan to putting Hillary Clinton in office (shown below).  On February 16th, 2017, Redditor theLAZYmd submitted a photoshopped picture of a shortened Trump walking down a tarmac with two secret service agents to /r/pics,[1] where it received more than 181,000 votes (65% upvoted) and 2,200 comments. On February 13th, 2017, the Game Grumps YouTube channel uploaded a video in which they play the game Wild Guns: Reloaded (shown below). At approximately 6:40 into the video, co-host Danny mentions a parody social media account known as "Hate Bagel," which he described as a a precursor to Nihilist Arbys. Within 24 hours, the video gained over 274,000 views and 1,400 comments. On Ocotber 26th, 2015, the @donaldtrumpdoingthings[2] Instagram feed posted a photoshopped picture of Vladirmir Putin's face superimposed over Donald Trump with the caption "Trumputin" (shown below). Within two years, the post gained over 870 likes and 100 comments. In the 1990s, threads containing humorous pickup lines were often shared on various Usenet groups, including alt.romance, alt.seduction and alt.humor.[9] On February 13th, 2017, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visited the White House for a first time face-to-face meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump. During a photo op before the press members, Trump reached his hand out for a handshake and Trudeau reciprocated by shaking his hand while facing the camera. While the moment went unnoticed in video, a photograph taken by Reuters photographer Kevin Lamarque captured an awkward split-second of Trudeau seemingly gazing at Trump's hand, which made it seem as if the prime minister was contemplating on whether to shake his hand. As many TV and internet news outlets broke their reports on the first face-to-face summit, the Reuters photograph instantly grabbed the attention of the readers, and by quarter after noon, a handful of people on Twitter[2][3] had already started cracking jokes about the awkwardly timed photograph. "Adult Swaddling" is the English name for Otonamaki, which was developed by Kyoto midwife and professor Nobuko Watanabe.[1] She believes the practice helps new mother recover from shoulder and hip pain, as well as destress, though other physicians fail to see the benefit.   While the moment "Relationship Goals" became a popular way to comment on images of couples on social media is unclear, one of the earliest articles to use "Relationship Goals" in that way was posted on Lifehack[1] on June 15th, 2009 in an article titled, "Relationship Goals: 8 Traveling Couples To Follow On Instagram." This was an example of the first type of #RelationshipGoals narrative, which was often employed for couples traveling to exotic locations.  In July 2016, Redditor AntoneFinance created the subreddit after accepting a bet to create a "meme, fad, or internet trend with significant Reddit-wide recognition" within two years. The idea of cursed images initially started on Tumblr, and the first account to publish exclusively cursed images was CursedImages.[3] On October 28th, 2015, they published their first post. The image, shown below, gained over 1,200 notes. On April 17th, 2011, YouTube user gschultz9 uploaded a video of his daughter trying an MRE (shown below). The video has gained over 2,300 views and inspired him to record more videos centered around MREs. Florida artist and Adobe creative resident Syd Weller's "Trash Doves" sticker set officially made its Facebook debut[1][2] on January 31st, 2017, which included an animated emoji of a headbanging pigeon (shown below). As early as on February 7th, the sticker suddenly went viral in Thailand, beginning with a music video posted on the Facebook page สัตว์โลกอมตีน[4] (Animals With Paws), where it garnered more than 3.7 million views within five days. On February 9th, 2017, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously ruled that the Trump's executive order imposing new travel restrictions on foreign nationals originating from seven Muslim-majority countries was unconstitutional. That evening, Trump posted the tweet "See you in court, the security of our nation is at stake!" in all capital letters (shown below). Within 24 hours, the tweet gained over 203,000 likes and 61,000 retweets.[1] Meanwhile, the @realdonaldtrump Instagram[8] feed posted a quote of the tweet on a blue background.  On January 23rd, 2017, the official Youtube channel of Zondag met Lubach posted the video titled "The Netherlands welcomes Trump in his own words", which featured a Donald Trump vocal impersonation giving a tour of The Netherlands; satirizing Trump's speech mannerisms and political views while introducing various notable- and less notable items from the country, ending the video with a request to Trump to add "The Netherlands Second" to his "America First" slogan.  On March 13th, 2015, YouTube released support for users to upload and view 360 degree video.[1] That day, YouTuber BrandJLa uploaded the site's first 360 degree video, featuring a computer animated scene in an alleyway from the perspective of a moving couch (shown below). Over the next two years, the video gained over 4.2 million views and 2,200 comments. On November 21st, 2010, a 4chan user submitted a thread asking viewers to speculate "would would win" in a battle between the video game characters Solid Snake and Sam Fisher (shown below). Four days later, a screenshot of the post was uploaded by FunnyJunk[2] user isaacshadow. In 2010, the B Button emoji was added to Unicode 6.0 under the name "Negative Squared Latin Capital Letter B" (shown below).[1]  According to Reddit's "About" section, Reddit gold is a "premium membership program" that confers a range of additional accessibility and customization tools that normal users do not possess.[2] The site allows users to give each other gold, in a process known as "gilding", usually for particularly humorous, original, and/or high-quality posts. Being gilded causes a Reddit gold icon to appear next to the post which is visible to everyone viewing. This, combined with the fact that the process is often anonymous on the giver's part, means that users who are gilded often edit their posts to thank their benefactors.[3] The trend of people suggesting lesbians were simply "girlfriends" or "gal pals" has long been prevalent. On July 3rd, 2014, Tumblr user getsby[5] posted a compilation of headlines that suggested two celebrity women engaging in homosexual activity were simply good friends (shown below). On January 18th, 2017, Trump tweeted a photograph of himself holding a pen and pad of paper while seated at a desk, stating that he was "writing my inaugural address at the Winter White House" (shown below). Within 24 hours, the tweet gained over 90,000 likes and 19,000 retweets.[1] Two minutes later, Twitter user Jules Suzdaltsev accused Trump of holding a "blank piece of paper" and a "closed sharpie" (shown below).[8]  While the original use of the picture as a reaction image is unclear, it likely started on Tumblr in the summer of 2013. The earliest-dated post featuring the image is a screenshot from Tumblr posted to memedroid[1] by joeblow9042 on August 15th, 2013. The screenshot, shown below, is of a post by a Tumblr account called dirkstridersbraces, though the name is now out of use. On March 6th, 2015, webcomic Escape From Heaven by Branson Reese[1] uploaded a strip called "Teen Comix." In the original, shown below, the second panel shows a shirt that reads "What if they made Simpsons porn illegal?" Despite the comic's wide spread as an exploitable, the original only has 379 notes as of February 8th, 2017. In the early 2000s, J.G. Wentworth released a television commercial in which various people yell the phrase "It's my money and I need it now!" out of windows. On January 14th, 2008, YouTuber PrzFtr uploaded the commercial to YouTube (shown below). On February 28th, 2013, the carsandwater YouTube channel uploaded a video of a ball of nickel heated till it is glowing placed on a pillar of dry ice (shown below). Within four years, the video gained over 4.2 million views and 2,200 comments. Since the end World War II, Anarchists and anti-fascist activists have often advocated for the use violent opposition to fascism. One of the most frequently cited inspirations for this belief comes from Nazi dictator Adolph Hitler, who in 1933 claimed that only violence could have been have prevented the rise of Nazism, if it had been utilized in the party's infancy. He said: "Only one danger could have jeopardised this development – if our adversaries had understood its principle, established a clear understanding of our ideas, and not offered any resistance. Or, alternatively, if they had from the first day annihilated with the utmost brutality the nucleus of our new movement."[1] In 1993, the Scottish anarcho-punk band Oi Polloi released the Guilty EP, which featured the song "Bash the Fash." The song features direct references to Hitler's quote: "Adolf Hitler himself said that the only way the rise of the German nazi party could have been prevented was if its enemies had recognised it for what it was right at the start and had smashed it in its infancy with utmost force."[3] Oi! Nineteen nineties and the nazis are back Family burnt out in an arson attack Children lying in hospital dying of their burns It's about time that everyone learns (to) BASH – BASH THE FASH! Germany in the thirties was the same A life or death struggle – not some kind of game Learn at least the basics of some martial art Then you'll be ready when the aggro starts B.N.P. scum marching on your street They even get elected when they should get beat Beat off the streets that belong to us You won't stop them with chants and placards so just First they came for the Jews And I did nothing to help them because I was not a Jew Then they came for the communists And I did nothing to help them because I was not a communist Next they came for the trade unionists And I did nothing to help them because I was not a trade unionist And then they came for me And there was no one left to help me Adolf Hitler himself said that the only way the rise of the German nazi party could have been prevented was if its enemies had recognised it for what it was right at the start and had smashed it in its infancy with utmost force. For once we would agree with him – waving placards and chanting at fascists through megaphones accomplishes absolutely nothing. The only way to stop nazi scum like the B.N.P. is by physically confronting them and literally kicking them off our streets. Nazi falls amidst a hall of fists and feet Stomping out the rhythm of the cable street beat With our boots on the scumbag's head The only good nazi is one that's dead A.F.A. girls and boys block the fash escape route Now we've got them cornered and they're gonna eat boot Trying to escape but they just can't manage Our boots rain in wreaking terrible damage "Shooting Stars" was originally released as the B-side to Bag Raiders' "Turbo Love" EP in 2008,[2] and made its first appearance on YouTube on October 1st, 2008 when an instrumental version was played in a game of Audiosurf (shown below). Bag Raiders later released "Shooting Stars" as a stand-alone single in 2009, which would later be put on their self-titled album in 2010. The song peaked at number 62 on the ARIA singles chart. On July 22nd, 2009, Modular People uploaded the song's video to YouTube. The video, shown below, is heavily influenced by retro synthwave aesthetics. It has over 13 million views. After the song was used by Australia's Got Talent in 2013, the song shot into the Top 40.[1] Derived from two other internet slang terms, "me IRL" and "2edgy4me," 2meirl4me was coined by Redditor AhrmiintheUnseen with the creation of a subreddit with the same name, where its members can share humorous or relatable image macros about living with depression, on April 29th, 2016. The illustration was originally part of a "How to Die Peacefully" article on WikiHow,[3] though it has since been removed from the article.[7] On December 18th, 2014, Twitter user @leyawn[1] posted several illustrations of people laying on their death bed, purportedly taken from a Wikihow article on how "to die" (shown below). On February 8th, 2017, Donald Trump posted a tweet about a "big increase in traffic" into the United States causing the American people to be "more vulnerable" while waiting for "what should be Easy D!," presumably referring to an ongoing court battle over his executive order on immigration (shown below).[1] The earliest traceable version of the original comic was uploaded to the furry art archive e621 on November 28th, 2011, by furry artist Furronika.[1] However, according to Wikifur,[2] most of Furronika's original art got deleted in 2010 and 2011; this makes it nearly impossible to trace back the original version. This also leaves it unclear if the phrase "hot monkey dick" was present in the original version, given the odd punchline where the male lead is convinced to buy a Playstation 3 due to having had intercourse with a monkey. During Super Bowl 51 on February 5th, 2017, Brady was filmed with his head down on a bench while his team was down 20-0 against the Atlanta Falcons during a FOX broadcast of the event. Immediately after, the Sports Illustrated Twitter feed immediately posted the clip of Brady with the caption "Tom Brady is sad" (shown below). Within 24 hours, the tweet gained over 3,700 likes and 1,900 retweets. Tom Brady is sad pic.twitter.com/wCMIqczhXa The Princess Bride was released on October 9th, 1987. The movie features a character named Fezzik played by André René Roussimoff. According to the Korean Wikipedia's article[1] and a Korean Central Television program called "The Love to the people is also in the rhythmic exercise" (KCTV)[2] aired in August 2015,[3][4][5] this exercise series was ordered by order of Kim Jong-il in March of 1993 as an improved version of similar exercises in Kim Il-sung era, People's Health Exercise (인민보건체조), at the North Korean Sports Science Center. After the release of the "adults" version of the video, 4 more rhythmic exercises, for children, elders, toddlers and babies, were released serially in the 1990s. Its soundtracks, except for the toddlers version, are played by Wangjaesan Light Music Band.[6] These official tutorial movies for the exercises are still aired on KCTV in 2010s. The Korean Workers' Party also created several sports-themed rhythmic exercises (Basketball, Soccer and Wrestling versions) during Kim Jong-un era. On March 6th, 2011, the food blog Panini Happy[10] published the results of an online poll, revealing that 54% of voters felt hot dogs were not sandwiches. On February 5th, 2017, at the beginning of the halftime show at Super Bowl LI, Lady Gaga sang a mashup of American folk songs "God Bless America" and "This Land Is Your Land," recited a bit of the American Pledge of Allegiance, then jumped from the roof of NRG Stadium and was lowered onto her stage via cables. The moment, shown below, immediately sparked jokes and pop culture comparisons on social media. The scene comes from the episode "Video Game Wizards," which aired March 26th, 2012.[1] In the episode, Rigby and Mordecai go on a road trip to a video game tournament, but Mordecai has picked Skips to be his partner at the tournament. Throughout the trip, Rigby aggressively targets Mordecai for not picking him. Rigby made a mix-tape with a song he recorded himself, called "Never Pick Their Friends." The night before the tournament, Rigby blasts Never Pick Their Friends from a boombox outside of the hotel they are all staying at, much to Mordecai's dismay (shown selow). The scene comes from the 22nd episode of The Simpson's fifth season, Secrets of a Successful Marriage, first aired in May 19th, 1994.[1] In the episode, Homer goes to an adult education center and peeks on a class of "Funk Dancing for Self-Defense" hosted by Moe. After doing some dance moves, Moe grabs a shotgun and fires several times. On the 30th of July, 2016, an anonymous user replied "can some tell me why sit on some is hot. i don't kown do y'all get off to this just thank (:" with an image of Carl Brutananadilewski to a thicc thread on /trash/[1]. A few days later, the first real iteration of the copypasta appeared in response to a Pokémon rule 34 thread, reading "can one tell me why do people like this because i really want to kown." with an image of Edd from Ed, Edd n Eddy[2]. On the 6th of August, 2016, the first known instance of the final copypasta was posted in a paw fetish thread[3], reading "can some tell me why do people like this because i really want to kown" with a GIF of confused Nick Young, which became associated with the copypasta and was later dubbed Mr Kown by /trash/ users. "Zhdun" is actually named 'Homunculus Loxodontus' and was created by Dutch sculptor Margriet van Breevoort.[1] The sculpture is of a Elephant Seal like being with arms sitting on a bench with an open seat next to it. It currently stands at LUMC Hospital in Leiden, and is intended to capture the emotion of a hospital waiting room (shown below). While it's unclear the exact date it was installed, Breevoort's Facebook page[2] shows a picture of her daughter hugging the statue dated May 28th, 2016. "Zhdun" (ЖДУН in Russian) is a fabricated noun version of the verb "zhdat", which means "to wait." On February 2nd, 2017, Conway appeared as a guest on Hardball with Chris Matthews, where she asserted that an attack known as the "Bowling Green Massacre" occurred in 2009 in Bowling Green, Kentucky, leading President Barack Obama to impose a six-month ban on Iraqi refugees (shown below). "I bet it’s brand new information to people that President Obama had a six-month ban on the Iraqi refugee program after two Iraqis came here to this country, were radicalized and they were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre. Most people don’t know that because it didn’t get covered." Shortly after the interview was broadcast, Twitter user @joesonka published a clip of Conway referring to the fictional event, which gained over 14,000 retweets and 13,000 likes within 24 hours (shown below). .KellyannePolls</a> says that 2 Iraqi refugees &quot;were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre.&quot;<br>(There was no such massacre.) <a href="https://t.co/sD3Nnb5xfE">pic.twitter.com/sD3Nnb5xfE</a></p>&mdash; Joe Sonka (joesonka) February 3, 2017  On the magical day of 25 Aug 2013, some curious furfag started a thread asking if the magical egg-laying-dragon-horse-dinosaur-frog gets bashful when he does his natural maternal(?) instinct in front of people like how a dog would care if he shits on top of your shoe rack. After posting apparently thrice, each with the melancholic quote of "haha" at the end, Yoshi is now recognised as the "Lay-egg haha guy" On November 21st, 2015, a 4chan user submitted a picture of Wojack along with the green text message ">tfw too intelligent to buy into pol's rhetoric" to the /pol/ board (shown below).[1] On February 6th, 2017, President Trump tweeted "I call my own shots, largely based on an accumulation of data, and everyone knows it. Some FAKE NEWS media, in order to marginalize, lies!" (shown below).[1] While it's unclear what exactly Trump is referring to, The Daily Dot[3] cites speculation that Trump is taking issue with a New York Times article[2] posted on the 5th that insinuates former Breitbart executive chairman and current top White House advisor Stephen Bannon snuck in language to an executive order that promoted Bannon to the National Security Council, and that Trump was not aware of the addition until after he signed the order. On 4chan, the name "Kekistan" has been suggested for various imaginary geographic locations many times since as early as December 2015, when a flag with the filename "kekistan.jpg" was submitted to the /int/ (international) board.[7] On December 14th, 2016, a thread regarding buying an island in the Caribbean was submitted to /pol/, to which several users suggested the land be named "Kekistan" (shown below).[6] On January 30th, 2017, YouTuber Sargon_of_Akkad tweeted that "shitposters meet the British govs criteria of an ethnicity," claiming he would register the group on the British census (shown below, left).[9] After asking followers what the ethnicity should be named, he settled on "Kekistani," describing the fictional group as a "disparate and dispossessed people" (shown below, right).[10][11] The earliest instances of “that feel" are rumored to have been posted on the German image board Krautchan[2] as early as May of 2010. On February 6th, 2012, a user named "Voyack" posted an "ask me anything thread" on Reddit[11] saying he was the Krautchan user "Wojak", the creator of the meme: Voyack reported that the bald man picture came from the Polish image board Vichan and was named "twarz.jpg" ("warm face"). On June 1st, 2016, the BBC Three YouTube channel uploaded a mini-documentary on the Hood Documentary series, in which the Simpson is shown pointing to his head and smiling after saying that he finds a woman "beautiful" because "she's got good brains," joking that she is skilled at performing oral sex (shown below). Within eight months, the video gained over 1.04 million views and 1,300 comments. On November 15th, 2016, the @FootyHumor[1] Twitter feed posted a screenshot of Ewumi pointing at his temple along with a joke about starting a fight with a girlfriend in order to play video games (shown below).  In 2013, Many Barrow published the images of the Roman soldier in a posted on the website Primary Homework Help. [10] The earliest known example of the Elmo Rise image was posted on November 1st, 2012 by CakeWrecks.com[1] user Jen. The writer describes the image as, "if it's wearing the stricken expression of someone who will give you all the candy you want if you please just don't hurt him…then you're probably looking in a mirror. So go have some fun-size Snickers and put your feet up, my friend, because you've earned it." In 1928, Magritte began working on "The Treachery of Images."[1] The painting became famous for its meta message, making the viewer aware that what it is seeing depicted in art is merely a representation of the thing itself. In a Magritte biography by Harry Torczyner, Magritte is quoted as saying: The famous pipe. How people reproached me for it! And yet, could you stuff my pipe? No, it's just a representation, is it not? So if I had written on my picture 'This is a pipe', I'd have been lying!

In response to a post by Tumblr user weedcellar that claimed "Eminem isn't violent, Slim Shady is," Tumblr user hoebutmadefashion posted "im robbing a bank tomorrow and when the cops come for me imma tell them it was my alter ego countess boochie flagrante." While the date of the post is unclear, Tumblr user signedsincerelymegan[1] reblogged the post on December 22nd, 2014, suggesting it was posted in late 2014. The term has its origins in the Korean language, as the onomatopoeia ㅋㅋㅋ, in which ㅋ stands for the "k" sounds, like in raspy, stifled laughter. In the real-time strategy game Starcraft, because the game originally did not support the Korean language, the onomatopoeia was written as "Kekeke" which can be translated to "Hahaha" in English. In the online multiplayer role-playing game WoW, released on November 23rd, 2004, players can choose to play on either the Alliance or Horde factions, which are considered enemies within the game's universe. Players of separate factions are unable to communicate with one-another, as their typed text is run through an in-game translator. For players of the Horde faction, typing the letters "LOL" results in members of the Alliance faction reading "KEK".

Within one month, the tweet gained over 2,700 likes and 1,700 retweets. The first real-time storytelling project on Twitter was started by Utah State University PhD students Marion Jensen and Tom Caswell with the reenactment of the 1863 Battle of Gettysburg[2] over a period of several weeks in April 2009. The retelling of the American Civil War's major battle involved numerous novelty Twitter accounts as proxies of historical figures, including generals and politicians from both The Union and The Confederacy. I'm announcing to the country that news from Army of the Potomac is such as to cover that army with the highest honor. On January 27th, 2017, in observance of the Holocaust Memorial Day, a Twitter bot named St. Louis Manifest (@Stl_Manifest)[2] began tweeting names and photographs of German Jewish refugees aboard MS St. Louis, a transatlantic liner which carried hundreds of asylum-seeking German Jews back to Nazi-occupied Europe after being denied entry by the U.S. Coast Guard in May 1939, using data from the United States Holocaust Memorial and Museum (USHMM).[4] According to the Pixiv Encyclopedia,[1] the term "Clothes That Kill Virgins" first appeared in a tweet by amateur illustrator Keyholder (キーホルダー) on July 5th, 2015.

Within 72 hours, the tweet gained over 10,000 retweets and favorites. 飲み会とかで何回か童貞を殺す服を見てきたけどやっぱりダントツはNO.S PROJECTのブラウスとかスカートとかそのへん pic.twitter.com/97hzMD9yWq — キーホルダー (@key774) July 6, 2015 Translation:  According to the Pixiv Encyclopedia[1], the sweater was originally nicknamed "Virgin-Killing Sweater," based off the name "Clothes That Kill Virgins", in a tweet by @Magane4989 on January 25th, 2017 (shown below).[2] The tweet featured pictures of blue and black halter neck sweaters from the otaku costume shop Seventy-Three on the Chinese online shopping website Taobao.[3] Within four days, the tweet gained over 67,000 likes and 56,000 retweets. Translation:  On December 14, 2016, Vinny streamed the construction park simulator Planet Coaster.[1] In the stream, Vinny, requested to record his voice to be placed in the in-game park, recorded a 27-second short, attempting to emulate the Super Mario Bros. Super Show! ending credits theme, "Do the Mario" (identified as "DootMario2.mp3") Although the clip went fairly unnoticed in the initial full-stream release, the shorter highlight video compilation, released on January 7, 2017, would include the DootMario segment.[2] On August 1st, 2014, The Daily Mail[6] published several photographs of Swift eating a cup of frozen yogurt and sitting by herself in a park in New York City (shown below). On January 25th, 2017, a photo from the article in which Swift is shown resting her chin on the palm of her hand was uploaded to Imgur (shown below, right).[1] On November 9th, 2015, The Huffington Post[1] published an interview with Bush, in which he revealed that he would kill baby Adolf Hitler if given the opportunity with an enthusiastic "hell yeah!" (shown below). Many found Bush's enthusiasm surprising given the candidate's mild and conservative behavior throughout the election cycle, heaving been mocked by Donald Trump as having "low energy." On January 28th, 2016, United States President Donald Trump signed a memorandum to reorganize the National Security Council (NSC), adding his chief strategist Steve Bannon and Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, while removing the director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. That day, Interim Dean Will Mebane of St. Paul's Episcospal Cathedral tweeted the hashtag #StopPresidentBannon, which gained over 180 likes and 150 retweets within 48 hours (shown below).[1] On July 19th, 2015, Tumblr user cupsnake100 published a text post that read, "The Earth is… a Cup."[1] The same day, user richhoneytrader100 reblogged the post, adding "Explain," and cupsnake100 reblogged their post with the explanation "Holds Things."[2] The post, shown below, has gained over 298,000 notes as of January 27th, 2017.    On July 18th, 1993, WCW held it's second annual Beach Blast Pay-Per-View event, in which Ric Flair won his 10th World Heavyweight title. After the match he was interviewed, wherein he uttered the following words: "Read what you wanna read, believe what you wanna believe, but GO TO BED every night of your life, knowing there's only one world heavyweight champion today, and it's the Nature Boy!" This interview was uploaded to YouTube on October 27th, 2008 by user Merriman24: The video has since been blocked by WWE on copyright grounds, but you can still view the interview on WWE's official channel here: In 1998, the non-profit organization MEMRI was co-founded in Washington D.C. by Yigal Carmon and Meyrav Wurmser for the purpose of distributing English translations of Middle Eastern media.On July 1st, 2004, MEMRI launched the MEMRI TV[2] Monitoring Project to track and translate Arab and Iranian TV channels to "bridge the language gap between the Middle East and the West."[3] On December 18th, 2011, YouTuber Blazing Catfur uploaded a compilation video titled "MEMRI's Greatest Hits Volume 1," containing clips of Muslim clerics expressing their hatred for Jewish people (shown below). The etymological root of the label may be attributed to "cash cow," an English idiomatic term used to describe a person, product or service that generates a steady stream of revenues, in allusion to milk produced by the dairy cow on a regular basis. One of the earliest online mentions of "lolcow" can be found in an Urban Dictionary entry submitted by DreadSmile on April 15th, 2007[1]. Early in the morning on January 26th, 2017, amidst a debate about the merits of torture after American President Donald Trump claimed torture "absolutely works,"[1] British comedian Lee Hurst tweeted[2] a scenario intended to challenge people to see under what conditions one would engage in torture: Your baby is tied to a timebomb. You have the terrorist. He tells you you have 1 hour. Do you #torture him to find your baby or let it die? On April 6th, 2015, the @InternetHippo[8] Twitter feed posted a mock dialogue in which a man named Phil proposes they call a giant advertising board a "philboard," followed by a man named Bill saying "I have a better idea" (shown below). Within two years, the tweet gained over 20,000 likes and 12,000 retweets. On August 18th, 2016, a stock photograph of two men captioned with the mock dialogue was submitted to /r/youdontsurf,[1] garnering 13,500 votes (91% upvoted) and 100 comments over the next five months (shown below). The nickname "Haitch" comes from English wrestler William Regal's mispronunciation of the letter H ("aitch") as "haitch." Regal's deliberate mispronunciations had formed something of a minor meme and in-joke in wrestling in the late 2000s. The image for "Haitchface" is derived from a 2003 WWE photoshoot.[1]  Although nobody knows exactly when this meme began, it took off in popularity sometime around late 2016 with an anonymous 4chan user posting pictures of Andy Biersack asking users: Would you suck a log of shit out of Andy Sixx's asshole? non-stop all day everyday. Sometimes the posting would stop but then resume unannounced and whenever users would try to acquire information from the poster as to why he was posting it all day, the log-poster would reply to them in-character as a humble servant to Andy Sixx with the same fictitious lore that Andy Sixx has entitled them to eat his shit and that he was simply doing his duty. Whenever people would try to insult the original poster, they were often fired back at with in-character responses that belittled them as not being worthy of consuming Sixx's feces regardless of the fictitious notion that Andy's logs are an unalienable right to all humans. To this date, it is still unknown why this meme started or why the poster who originally posted it began it. A fan-made Wix site was made shortly after its initial origins in early 2017. The site portrayed the Black Veil Brides Army as a well organized and strictly bureaucratic and professional organization providing a variety of services to people that involved Andy Sixx's shit. In addition to the website, a blog was also posted constantly called the BVB Army News with new entries arriving every few days that reported fictitious stories engulfed in further lore behind the meme. The creator of the website was very consistent with his stories, sometimes making multiple articles for the same story that spanned over a few weeks, one of which included a war with the so-called Blood on the Dance Floor Air Force that was involved in a bloody military campaign against the BVB Army that was ultimately ended when US President Donald Trump ordered the two to reach a ceasefire agreement or face intervention from the US military. On May 5th, 2016 , the Youtube channel Canal do Bambam uploaded a video titled "O MONSTRO TA SAINDO DA JAULA" (THE MONSTER IS GETTING OUT OF THE CAGE).

In the first quarter of a cold and rainy 2017 AFC Championship game against the Pittsburgh Steelers on January 22nd, 2017, New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady was seen on the Patriots bench wearing a large coat (shown below). On June 30th, 2003, Urban Dictionary[1] user Tai submitted an entry for "smash," defining it as the "process of fucking someone good" (shown below).  On January 20th, 2017, shortly after Donald Trump delivered his first presidential speech at the inauguration ceremony, Deadspin[2] editor Timothy Burke tweeted a video comparing a line said by President Trump during his inaugural address and a memorable scene from The Dark Knight Rises wherein Bane delivers a populist speech to declare his reign over Gotham City by telling the citizens. pic.twitter.com/dYECwneW1R Trump: Today's ceremony, however, has very special meaning because today, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another, but we are transferring power from Washington, D.C. and giving it back to you, the people.[1] Bane: “We take Gotham from the corrupt! The rich! The oppressors of generations who have kept you down with myths of opportunity, and we give it back to you… the people. Gotham is yours. None shall interfere. Do as you please.”[13] In the M. Night Shyamalan film Split (2016), James McAvoy plays a character with 23 different personalities.[1] He abducts three girls. In the film, one of the characters is seen crying ,"Help! I've been abducted by a man with split personalities!" into a walkie talkie. During the inauguration of Donald Trump on January 20th, 2017, Melania Trump was filmed briefly smiling at her husband before making what appeared to be a frown immediately after he turned away (re-upload shown below). Following the ceremony, a video clip of the moment began circulating online, with many speculating that Melania Trump was unhappy in her marriage.   On January 21st, 2017, a video was uploaded to YouTube showing a group of student protesters at the University of Washington chanting "Who has the power? We've got the power" are interrupted by a man saying "Hey hey hey, this is library.". The original video has since been removed but was subsequently reuploaded (shown below). "The Narrator" gag in which a person says something but is then interrupted by a narrator immediately contradicting the statement is a popular trope of the television series Arrested Development (2003). The show's narrator, voiced by Ron Howard, often interjects during scenes to clarify falsehoods made by the show's characters (ex: shown below).[1] Michael: "Okay, that would be disgusting if you’d actually slept with her, but I don’t think you did. G.O.B.: "I did. And it was disgusting." Narrator: "They didn’t, but it would have been." On January 21st, 2017, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer held his first press conference under President Trump. There, he chastised the media for supposedly falsely reporting on the size of the crowd at Trump's inauguration. Despite photographic evidence to the contrary, Spicer insisted Trump's inauguration had the highest attendance numbers ever, echoing Trump's claim that 1.5 million people attended his inauguration when the official report placed the number at 250,000.[1] The song debuted on Season 1, Episode 14 of Phineas and Ferb, "Dude, We're Getting the Band Back Together," which aired on March 8th, 2008."[1] In the episode, the titular characters attempt to reunite the rock band Love Händel for their parents' wedding anniversary. They find Love Händel drummer, Swampy, at the library, where he and the boys sing "Ain't Got No Rhythm," explaining why he cannot rejoin the band. The song received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics. On January 19th, 2017, YouTuber shonkywonkydonkey uploaded a remix of the song, combining it with"You Reposted in the Wrong Neighborhood":/memes/you-reposted-in-the-wrong-neighborhood. The video has garnered more than 350,000 views.[2] On January 20th, 2017, LaBeouf launched the livestream during the inauguration of Donald Trump.[1] According to Indiewire, hundreds of people showed up to the livestream location the first day, including actor Jaden Smith.[4] "Open to all, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, the participatory performance will be live-streamed continuously for four years, or the duration of the presidency. In this way, the mantra "HE WILL NOT DIVIDE US" acts as a show of resistance or insistence, opposition or optimism, guided by the spirit of each individual participant and the community." In Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, Chancellor Palpatine, secretly Darth Sidious, tells Anakin Skywalker a legend to lure him further to the dark side of the force, as Anakin was having visions of his wife, Padmé Amidala, dying in childbirth. The legend is about a Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Plagueis The Wise, who could influence midichlorions to prevent people from dying. However, he taught his apprentice all he knew, and then the apprentice killed him while he was asleep. Palpatine finds the legend ironic because while Darth Plagueis could save others from death, he could not save himself. In the copypasta, Palpatine's last line and all of Anakin's are removed.  On January 16th, 2017, YandereDev uploaded a video titled "Mid-January Progress Report," in which he uttered the phrase "woah technology" to describe a gameplay feature in Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty in which ice cubes would melt if the player waited long enough. YandereDev then described how he wanted to add similar details to Yandere Simulator to impress players. "When I first saw this, it blew my mind! I was like, 'woah technology'!" On January 20th, 2017, the day of Donald Trump's presidential inauguration, Richard B. Spencer, a leading figure of alt-right and the president of the white supremacist think-tank group National Policy Institute, participated in a street interview with an Australian Broadcasting Company (ABC) correspondent and documentary filmmakers at the corner of 14th and K Streets in downtown Washington D.C. In the middle of the interview, several masked protesters approach Spencer from behind the camera to confront his stance on neo-Nazism, during which he is suddenly punched in the face by a hooded assailant while trying to explain the significance of his Pepe lapel pin. Later that same day, video footage of the incident was uploaded to YouTube by RawStory reporter Sarah Burris and the ABC website. On January 15th, 2011, DeviantArtist[3] misssuan002 posted a 3D art image featuring a small man being cradled cradled like a baby by a larger woman (shown below).

The video has since been reuploaded to YouTube (shown below). According to Cringeworthy.net,[9] the word "cringeworthy" was popularized by the introduction of the character Cuthbert Cringeworthy to the British comic strip The Bash Street Kids[3] in 1972. At about 9:42 AM on January 20th, 2017, Donald Trump arrived at The White House to be sworn in as President of the United States. Upon arrival, Melania Trump gifted Michelle Obama with a Tiffany's box. Michelle seemed confused with what to do with it for a moment, and briefly glimpsed at a nearby camera.

He patented the process in 1904 and presented his device for the first time in 1907 at a cinema in Graz, Styria.[1][2] Other filmmakers began recreating the effect using a camera technique called "overcranking," which involved recording at a high frame rate and playing the footage back at normal speed. The earliest known hubsite for slow motion videos titled "Ultraslo"[4] was launched on October 14th, 2005. The image was first posted in March 2011 as part of an Inforgraphic Dump from the marketing blog Kissmetrics Blog.[1] There the image was used to show the general different perceptions of color between males and females. On January 17th, 2017, U.S. Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut asked DeVos if she believed "guns have any place in or around our schools," to which she responded that it was "best left to locales and states to decide." When asked to elaborate, DeVos replied that schools in Wyoming might need guns on campus "to protect from potential grizzlies." That evening, a clip of the grizzly bears statement was tweeted by activist Deray Mckesson, which gained over 6,000 likes and 4,900 retweets within 72 hours.[4] The original image comes from the OEL (Original English-Language) manga Serenity, described by TV Tropes as "chronicling Serenity's ensuing dilemmas as she tries to find peace and meaning in her life through Christianity" following her transfer to a new school.[1] A Reddit user on r/OutOfTheLoop explained that the series is "considered by both Christians and atheists to be pretty shitty. It became a meme thanks to 4chan and Tumblr which started photoshopping the panel into hentai."[2] General Grievous first appears on the Cartoon Network animated series Star Wars: Clone Wars in Chapter 20, which aired on April 8th, 2004 (shown below, left).[1] He gains notoriety in the series as he is able to kill over several jedi before the series concludes leading into the next movie. He then later appears in the opening battle sequence of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith.[1] There, he fights Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker while holding Chancellor Palpatine prisoner (shown below, right). On January 4, 2017, Jack uploaded a video announcing that the channel officially hit 14 million subscribers, during the video Jack thanks all the fans for the support and other people such as Mark, Felix and his editor Robin, as well as telling the viewers about his plans in 2017, at the end when Jack is doing his usual outro, he hits his face (actually the side of his head), and he laughs at it and continue his outro, at the very end after the outro music, Jack humorously blames his hair for it.[1] On October 25th, 2016, a now-deactivated Redditor began a new storytime post on /r/AskReddit, asking the "health inspectors of Reddit" to share their stories about the worst code violations they have seen on the job. In response to the thread, Redditor Chamale[1] told a story about his step father working as a baker in an authentic 18th century recreation of a New French fortress. After convincing the health inspector that the kitchen was as health-conscious as possible without sacrificing the integrity of the 18th-century recreation, the inspector spotted a cow roaming around the fortress and licking all the bread. Redditor poem_for_your_sprog, whose gimmick is to respond to comments by turning their content into poems, wrote a poem[2] in response to the story (shown below).

This video shows the Nintendo Switch Parental control features, being used by Bowser and his son, Bowser Jr, with a female narrator. (In the original Japanese version, the narrator is male.) The video immediately became popular due to the way it depicts Bowser, a well known villain, as a responsible father. It gained over 2 million views and 60k likes in the span of three days, and appeared on the YouTube trending bar.  The practice of listing formative albums is a common practice among music lovers and was long before the Facebook trend began. For example, Reddit Reed498[1] posted such a list to /r/Music on July 22nd, 2015. According to the Online Etymology Dictionary,[5] the term "tarnation" originated in the late 1700s as a euphemism for "damnation." On May 13th, 2003, Urban Dictionary user Ron Jackson submitted an entry for "what in tarnation?", defining it as a phrase used by American inhabiting areas south of the Mason-Dixon line. *The first apearence of ''Mm-hmm'' was first seen in the TV show ‘’Sponge Bob Square Pants’’ in the channel ‘’Nickelodeon (later changed to Nick)’’ the year 1999 in the episode 2b of the first season; ‘’Ripped pants’’. Transcript from the episode: SpongeBob: Could I borrow a couple of these? Fish: [through his marshmallow-filled mouth] Mm-hmm. [crams another marshmallow into his mouth. SpongeBob takes two marshmallows and places them on the twig] And now, with the addition of two, count 'em, two marshmallows. [SpongeBob preps himself for his lift, inhales deeply, takes hold of the twig, and is unable to lift it. The crowd isn't moved. He tries again. And again. After a huge effort, SpongeBob hears a rip. He looks down and notices that he's ripped his pants. The crowd gasps, then laughs at SpongeBob. SpongeBob scuttles off, embarrassed. Scooter walks over, laughing] Its presumed that it started gaining fame from the video posted by the user ''Sticktheory'' in the year 2011. Green screen template: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was published by EA Games and released in the United States on November 15th, 2001.[1] It was initially developed for the PlayStation, Microsoft Windows, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance and Mac OS X. The character Hagrid serves as the groundskeeper of the game's setting, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and occasionally sends the player, Harry Potter, on errands and missions (seen at 13:11 in the video below). On October 22nd, 2016, YouTuber wankerflaps uploaded a video titled “Bee Movie But it Keeps Getting Faster,” featuring the audio track from the film which is progressively sped up (shown below). The image comes from the 1997 Christian comic pamphlet Charlie's Ants written by American cartoonist Jack Chick, which begins with the titular character trying to warn an ant colony about an impending flood, before his friend Sarah shows up to tell the story of the life of Jesus through a series of vignettes illustrating various passages from the Bible. The digital scans of the pamphlet were uploaded by Kansas City With Russian Accent[1] blogger Meecha on November 5th, 2010. Two pieces of religious literature found their way into my daughter’s Halloween candy bag. One was just a regular humorless booklet and the other one is a Chick Tract similar to the one I posted previously but slightly dumbed down for the children. For the record, I don’t mind these things; I imagine people do it with the best of intentions. If someone went through the trouble of rubber-banding a Chick Tract to a candy bar, the least I can do is to eat the candy and post the rest.  Pathetic Skinner is a reaction image typically used to mock behavior. In the reaction images, Skinner is either slightly redrawn, or placed into a new setting. A slight description is provided and the image is shown with the text "Pathetic" written underneath. The image is taken from the Season 1 episode of The Simpsons, "Bart the Genius." In the episode, Principal Skinner is informed that Bart has been vandalizing the side of the school, causing Skinner to stare downward menacingly, as seen here: In the episode itself, Skinner does not say the word "Pathetic", but instead only looks downward. cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/053/376/504" height=185> The image came from a picture of a peregrine falcon.[1] The first Millennial Falcon post (pictured below) appeared on the image sharing website Imgur on January 10th, 2017, from ChrisDurpaderpherp[2] who posted both an example of the meme and the template. The post quickly brought in almost 221,000 views and around 5,000 upvotes (shown below). On August 9th 2006, the Bionicle News Site BZPower posted a news article about a promotion Lego was doing with the Danish Donald Duck Magazine, which was of a small Bionicle set officially named "Good Guy" [2]. The next day, BZPower posted an article about a similar set that was also a promotion with the same magazine, who was officially called "Bad Guy" [3]. They also noted that the set resembled a similar promotional set whose partnership was unknown at the time.[4] This one would often be dubbed "Duracell Bad Guy" due to being packaged with Duracell batteries. In the anime “Tokyo Ghoul”, Yamori cracks his finger every time he tortures Ken Kaneki. This teaches him to crack his own fingers after his escape.(Shown Below) The video was uploaded on February 5th, 2016 by THEFOOLHARDYGUY, which so far has almost 500k views (shown below).

FrogTron originated on 4chan's /b/ board in a Hunger Games Thread on August 22nd, 2016 [1]. The following day, a new thread was created with the intent on making FrogTron a meme[2], leading to a raid on the My Hero Academia Wiki, and the page for Tsuyu Asui to be vandalized.[3] On August 23rd, 2016 an official FrogTron twitter account[4] was created with the sole purpose of getting JonTron to mention the pairing. On August 31st, 2016, FrogTron made it's way to Tumblr in the form of an official blog ran by the same person that runs the FrogTron Twitter account[5]. The goal of the blog was to try to give move exposure to the pairing. The blog posted art made by users of 4chan, and things relating to both JonTron and Tsuyu Asui. (As of February 20th, 2017 this blog has 120+ followers.) Thirteen days later, on September 13th, 2016 FrogTron became a running joke on the blog kibou-dere[6].

On January 11th, 2017, Donald Trump held his first press conference since being elected the President in November. During the Q&A portion of the event, several journalists asked Trump to address the allegations of his presidential campaign's ties to the Russian government, which had been building up for weeks since the U.S. intelligence officials confirmed Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. In response, Trump deflected the questions by railing against CNN and BuzzFeed for publishing unverified information as news, to which CNN journalist Jim Acosta repeatedly tried to follow-up with a question on whether his staff had any contact with Russia in leading up to and during the presidential campaign. Trump flat out refused to answer by telling Acosta, "You don't get a question… your organization is terrible… your organization is fake news" (shown below).  Polandball comic strips were created by a British individual known as "FALCO" in the /INT/ board of Krautchan[1] around September 2009. Unlike other image-boards on the German-language site, /INT/ board[2] is frequented by English-speaking netizens from the rest of Europe and the world. According to several sources[3], FALCO's original comics were decidedly apolitical and aimed to poke fun at a fellow Polish /INT/ user "Wojak", who frequently posted in less than perfect English. One of his memorable quotes "I Know That Feel" also became a meme in May 2010. However, as the cartoon's appeal grew within the /INT/ board, some of the derivative artworks began to reflect on the subject of European Union and international relations, featuring other country balls like Russia, Germany, Austria, Great Britain and the United States.  Common depositories of stock photographs weren't easily accessible to public until the arrival of large corporate agencies like Getty Images and Corbis in the 1990s.

However, there is no historical evidence that the real Caesar actually said these words. Regardless, the quote remained culturally relevant over the following centuries as a staple quote in European literature and pop culture that encapsulates one's surprise at betrayal from a friend. In May 2008, American writer Mike Sacks uploaded a compilation of screen captured images taken from various local news segments in a webpage titled “Photos of TV,”[5] which included a screenshot of a New Jersey UPN9 news reporter providing a description of something that is "absolutely disgusting" in his vicinity, as suggested by the accompanying lower-third caption.

As of January 2017, it accumulated to over 1,600 loops and 1,900 likes on the site. While not being an instant viral success by any means, Quinn continued to create parodies with the same formula, using various random names such as "William" (shown below, left) and "Daniel" (shown below, right). They soon became a lasting series on Vine and Quinn's signature joke. The original image features a lizard reading a Steam chat in a which a user named 1 rooting tooting motherfucker writes "henlo lizer. helllo you STINKY LIZARD. go eat a fly ugly" (shown below).

In 1867's Das Kapital, Karl Marx[1] wrote that should a laborer "own (his) means of production, and was satisfied to live as a labourer, he need not work beyond beyond the time necessary for the reproduction of his means of subsistence, say 8 hours a day." The full phrase "seize the means of production" first appeared in black activist W. E. B. DuBois' posthumous autobiography published in 1968,[2] when he wrote that he considered himself a communist: "It is a historical fact that blacks were brought to this country for the profit of the ruling class which at the time were landowners. They needed someone to till the soil and grow profitable crops. Today we have shifted from an agrarian economy to a goods-production economy. But the same relationships exist between the private owner and the worker. Nothing has changed. Therefore, for working people to be free, they must seize control of the means of production."

On the March 21st, 2003 episode "The Sponge Who Could Fly", live-action character Patchy the Pirate purports to find a tape that shows a "lost episode" of SpongeBob. At the end of the episode, he puts in the tape and finds the clip is simply a series of SpongeBob doing walk cycles to upbeat music before abruptly showing the EBS color bars (shown below). After Patchy sees this, he proclaims that "SpongeBob betrayed us!", throws out all his SpongeBob merchandise and runs away.

Teleporting behind someone is a common method of besting an opponent in various action-orientated anime series, where fighters move with supernatural speed or can teleport short distances at will. On TV Tropes, the technique is listed as "No, I Am Behind You";[1] where the possible origin of the trope is linked to the rapid movement technique[2] from the Dragon Ball series. In the context of bladed weapons, the trope may have originated with the series Bleach.

According to Wikipedia,[1]The sign, which originally read "Hollywoodland," was built in 1923 by a group of L.A.-based real estate developers as a billboard advertisement[8] for an upscale residential housing project with the same name. At 45-foot-long (13.7 meters), 350 feet (106.7 meters) wide and studded with nearly 4,000 20-watt light bulbs, the sign was initially intended to be displayed for 18 months, but it became a permanent fixture with the rapid expansion of the area in the following decades. In 1949, the Los Angeles Parks Department commissioned a major restoration of the sign, which had sustained heavy damage in the absence of regular maintenance since the Great Depression. In the process, the letters LAND were removed in order to reflect the entire neighborhood.

Baymax was created by the brilliant Tadashi Hamada as a healthcare-providing robot nurse/doctor for the citizens of San Fransokyo and his brother, Hiro Hamada. Tadashi's goal in creating Baymax was to help improve healthcare around the world, basically wanting nothing more than to use his creation and genius for the betterment of humanity. To provide him with his programming and overall personality, Baymax was given a special chip with Tadashi's inscriptions. The chip makes him the lovable robot he truly is, for without it, he can be conceived as an entirely different being. As programming would have, Baymax is instantly summoned by the sound of distress, and can only deactivate once his current patient states "I am satisfied with my care."

The term derives from the wrestling tag team The Rockers, formed in 1985, which consisted of the now-legendary Shawn Michaels and the "other Rocker", Marty Jannetty. Following their storyline break-up in early 1992, Jannetty was supposed to remain a heroic character while Michaels became a villain. However, Jannetty had several absences owing to real-life personal reasons, and so Michaels continued to develop his villainous character in other storylines, building his reputation and eventual legacy.[1] Michaels eventually went on to win several championships and perform at a main event level, while Jannetty floundered in the mid-card and faded into obscurity.

First appearing in the 2005 beta release of Roblox, the death sound has remained a staple element in it's 10+ year history. The sound effect triggers when a "Humanoid's" (the character models controlled by players) health reaches zero, out of a base maximum of 100.[1] Since the worlds are crafted primarily by the players, this can be achieved by having the hit boxes assigned to the body parts of a Humanoid struck by tools that are purposefully coded to decrease the health (such as spike traps, or falling into the void of a map, for examples). Based on the speed of the humanoid, the sound effect would be change. Players would attempt to make their characters move as fast as possible in the hopes of hearing the sound effect drastically pitch shifted.  On December 11, 2016, Feliks Zemdegs broke the world record on the 3×3 Rubik's Cube, achieving a time of 4.73 seconds.

ASCII Art, or the concept of turning letters and characters into pictures, has been around since at least 1966. However, the earliest known iteration of ASCII-based facial expression is the smiley face (represented as ":-)" to indicate sarcasm in the preceding statement) as proposed by ARPANET user Kevin MacKenzie[7] via MsgGroup mailing list on April 12th, 1979. The earliest recorded usage of the smiley face has been attributed to a post written by Scott Fahlman, submitted after a three day long discussion[18] on the Carnegie Mellon University computer science general message board about jokes and how to distinguish humor online: Fahlman took credit for inventing the “:-)” and “:-(” emoticons on his website.[8] Decades later, Fahlman stated in an April 2001 interview[9] that he created the smiley to better understand his peers, whose sarcasm on the message board was sometimes misread due to the lack of facial expressions or tone of voice. Meanwhile, the term “Emoticon,” a blending of the words “emotion” and “icon,” appeared in print publications for the first time in the New York Times on January 28th, 1990 and added to the Oxford English Dictionary (shown below) in its June 2001 print edition, followed by the first Urban Dictionary[1] definition submitted on October 1, 2002.

Those hinge knees, man. I’ve found no origin story, no other record of his being a thing that answers any questions about what Darigold was thinking and how long he was (to them and the schoolchildren who saw him daily) a thing."

They believe that through the magic -- you call it black magic, they call it witchcraft -- you are able to send lightning to strike someone. Can you explain that scientifically because it’s something that happens?” The character is rumored to have originated from the Finnish image board Ylilauta.

The origin of the D.A.K. 16-10-16 prophecy are unknown, as early threads referencing it have been deleted. Also, the meaning is a point of debate among 4chan users.[1] D.A.K. is understood to be a German acronym, but it is unclear what the letters stand for. The most popular theories of what it could stand for are "Das Armageddon Kommt" (The Armageddon Comes), or Deutsch Afrikakorps, referring to the German expeditionary force sent to Africa at the start of World War II.[2] As for the date, 4chan users have theorized that 16-10-16 refers to an apocalyptic section of the Bible from the Book of Revelations that reads: Revelation 16:10-16King James Version (KJV) 10 And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain, 11 And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds. 12 And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared. 13 And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet. 14 For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty. 15 Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame. 16 And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon. One of the earliest known uses of "really makes you think" on /pol/ came on April 21st, 2016,[3] as a comment accompanying the political cartoon, shown below. According to Bustle,[2] the story first appeared on 4chan around 2010. In the story, the protagonist David attempts to walk through all nine rooms in a haunted house attraction to win a $500 prize. As he explores the building, each room becomes increasingly disturbing, and the narrator begins to wonder if he will ever escape the house. Let me start by saying that Peter Terry was addicted to heroin. We were friends in college and continued to be after I graduated. Notice that I said "I". He dropped out after two years of barely cutting it. After I moved out of the dorms and into a small apartment, I didn't see Peter as much. We would talk online every now and then (AIM was king in pre-Facebook years). There was a period where he wasn't online for about five weeks straight. I wasn't worried. He was a pretty notorious flake and drug addict, so I assumed he just stopped caring. Then one night I saw him log on. Before I could initiate a conversation, he sent me a message. "David, man, we need to talk." That was when he told me about the NoEnd House. It got that name because no one had ever reached the final exit. The rules were pretty simple and cliche: reach the final room of the building and you win $500. There were nine rooms in all. The house was located outside the city, roughly four miles from my house. Apparently Peter had tried and failed. He was a heroin and who-knows-what-the-fuck addict, so I figured the drugs got the best of him and he wigged out at a paper ghost or something. He told me it would be too much for anyone. That it was unnatural. I didn't believe him. I told him I would check it out the next night and no matter how hard he tried to convince me otherwise, $500 sounded too good to be true. I had to go. I set out the following night. When I arrived, I immediately noticed something strange about the building. Have you ever seen or read something that shouldn't be scary, but for some reason a chill crawls up your spine? I walked toward the building and the feeling of uneasiness only intensified as I opened the front door. My heart slowed and I let a relieved sigh leave me as I entered. The room looked like a normal hotel lobby decorated for Halloween. A sign was posted in place of a worker. It read, "Room 1 this way. Eight more follow. Reach the end and you win!" I chuckled and made my way to the first door. The first area was almost laughable. The decor resembled the Halloween aisle of a K-Mart, complete with sheet ghosts and animatronic zombies that gave a static growl when you passed by. At the far end was an exit; it was the only door besides the one I entered through. I brushed through the fake spider webs and headed for the second room. I was greeted by fog as I opened the door to room two. The room definitely upped the ante in terms of technology. Not only was there a fog machine, but a bat hung from the ceiling and flew in a circle. Scary. They seemed to have a Halloween soundtrack that one would find in a 99 cent store on loop somewhere in the room. I didn't see a stereo, but I guessed they must have used a PA system. I stepped over a few toy rats that wheeled around and walked with a puffed chest across to the next area. I reached for the doorknob and my heart sank to my knees. I did not want to open that door. A feeling of dread hit me so hard I could barely even think. Logic overtook me after a few terrified moments, and I shook it off and entered the next room. Room three is when things began to change. On the surface, it looked like a normal room. There was a chair in the middle of the wood paneled floor. A single lamp in the corner did a poor job of lighting the area, casting a few shadows across the floor and walls. That was the problem. Shadows. Plural. With the exception of the chair's, there were others. I had barely walked in the door and I was already terrified. It was at that moment that I knew something wasn't right. I didn't even think as I automatically tried to open the door I came through. It was locked from the other side. That set me off. Was someone locking the doors as I progressed? There was no way. I would have heard them. Was it a mechanical lock that set automatically? Maybe. But I was too scared to really think. I turned back to the room and the shadows were gone. The chair's shadow remained, but the others were gone. I slowly began to walk. I used to hallucinate when I was a kid, so I wrote off the shadows as a figment of my imagination. I began to feel better as I made it to the halfway point of the room. I looked down as I took my steps and that's when I saw it. Or didn't see it. My shadow wasn't there. I didn't have time to scream. I ran as fast as I could to the other door and flung myself without thinking into the room beyond. The fourth room was possibly the most disturbing. As I closed the door, all light seemed to be sucked out and put back into the previous room. I stood there, surrounded by darkness, not able to move. I'm not afraid of the dark and never have been, but I was absolutely terrified. All sight had left me. I held my hand in front of my face and if I didn't know what I was doing, I would never have been able to tell. Darkness doesn't describe it. I couldn't hear anything. It was dead silence. When you're in a sound-proof room, you can still hear yourself breathing. You can hear yourself being alive. I couldn't. I began to stumble forward after a few moments, my rapidly beating heart the only thing I could feel. There was no door in sight. Wasn't even sure there was one this time. The silence was then broken by a low hum. I felt something behind me. I spun around wildly but could barely even see my nose. I knew it was there, though. Regardless of how dark it was, I knew something was there. The hum grew louder, closer. It seemed to surround me, but I knew whatever was causing the noise was in front of me, inching closer. I took a step back; I had never felt that kind of fear. I can't really describe true fear. I wasn't even scared I was going to die; I was scared of what the alternative was. I was afraid of what this thing had in store for me. Then the lights flashed for a second and I saw it. Nothing. I saw nothing and I know I saw nothing there. The room was again plunged into darkness and the hum became a wild screech. I screamed in protest; I couldn't hear this goddamn sound for another minute. I ran backwards, away from the noise, and fumbled for the door handle. I turned and fell into room five. Before I describe room five, you have to understand something. I am not a drug addict. I have had no history of drug abuse or any sort of psychosis short of the childhood hallucinations I mentioned earlier, and those were only when I was really tired or just waking up. I entered the NoEnd House with a clear head. After falling in from the previous room, my view of room five was from my back, looking up at the ceiling. What I saw didn't scare me; it simply surprised me. Trees had grown into the room and towered above my head. The ceilings in this room were taller than the others, which made me think I was in the center of the house. I got up off the floor, dusted myself off, and took a look around. It was definitely the biggest room of them all. I couldn't even see the door from where I was; various brush and trees must have blocked my line of sight with the exit. Up to this point, I figured the rooms were going to get scarier, but this was a paradise compared to the last room. I also assumed whatever was in room four stayed back there. I was incredibly wrong. As I made my way deeper into the room, I began to hear what one would hear if they were in a forest; chirping bugs and the occasional flap of birds seemed to be my only company in this room. That was the thing that bothered me the most. I heard the bugs and other animals, but I didn't see any of them. I began to wonder how big this house was. From the outside when I first walked up to it, it looked like a regular house. It was definitely on the bigger side, but this was almost a full forest in here. The canopy covered my view of the ceiling, but I assumed it was still there, however high it was. I couldn't see any walls, either. The only way I knew I was still inside was that the floor matched the other rooms: the standard dark wood paneling. I kept walking, hoping that the next tree I passed would reveal the door. After a few moments of walking, I felt a mosquito fly onto my arm. I shook it off and kept going. A second later, I felt about ten more land on my skin at different places. I felt them crawl up and down my arms and legs and a few made their way across my face. I flailed wildly to get them all off but they just kept crawling. I looked down and let out a muffled scream – more of a whimper, to be honest. I didn't see a single bug. Not one bug was on me, but I could feel them crawl. I heard them fly by my face and sting my skin but I couldn't see a single one. I dropped to the ground and began to roll wildly. I was desperate. I hated bugs, especially ones I couldn't see or touch. But these bugs could touch me and they were everywhere. I began to crawl. I had no idea where I was going; the entrance was nowhere in sight and I still hadn't even seen the exit. So I just crawled, my skin wriggling with the presence of those phantom bugs. After what seemed like hours, I found the door. I grabbed the nearest tree and propped myself up, mindlessly slapping my arms and legs to no avail. I tried to run, but I couldn't; my body was exhausted from crawling and dealing with whatever it was that was on me. I took a few shaky steps to the door, grabbing each tree on the way for support. It was only a few feet away when I heard it. The low hum from before. It was coming from the next room and it was deeper. I could almost feel it inside my body, like when you stand next to an amp at a concert. The feeling of the bugs on me lessened as the hum grew louder. As I placed my hand on the doorknob, the bugs were completely gone but I couldn't bring myself to turn the knob. I knew that if I let go, the bugs would return and there was no way I would make it back to room four. I just stood there, my head pressed against the door marked six and my hand shakily grasping the knob. The hum was so loud I couldn't even hear myself pretend to think. There was nothing I could do but move on. Room six was next, and room six was Hell. I closed the door behind me, my eyes held shut and my ears ringing. The hum was surrounding me. As the door clicked into place, the hum was gone. I opened my eyes in surprise and the door I had shut was gone. It was just a wall now. I looked around in shock. The room was identical to room three – the same chair and lamp – but with the correct amount of shadows this time. The only real difference was that there was no exit door and the one I came in through was gone. As I said before, I had no previous issues in terms of mental instability, but at that moment I fell into what I now know was insanity. I didn't scream. I didn't make a sound. At first I scratched softly. The wall was tough, but I knew the door was there somewhere. I just knew it was. I scratched at where the doorknob was. I clawed at the wall frantically with both hands, my nails being filed down to the skin against the wood. I fell silently to my knees, the only sound in the room the incessant scratching against the wall. I knew it was there. The door was there, I knew it was just there. I knew if I could just get past this wall - "Are you alright?" I jumped off the ground and spun in one motion. I leaned against the wall behind me and I saw what it was that spoke to me; to this day I regret ever turning around. There was a little girl. She was wearing a soft, white dress that went down to her ankles. She had long blonde hair to the middle of her back and white skin and blue eyes. She was the most frightening thing I had ever seen, and I know that nothing in my life will ever be as unnerving as what I saw in her. While looking at her, I saw something else. Where she stood I saw what looked like a man's body, only larger than normal and covered in hair. He was naked from head to toe, but his head was not human and his toes were hooves. It wasn't the Devil, but at that moment it might as well have been. The form had the head of a ram and the snout of a wolf. It was horrifying and it was synonymous with the little girl in front of me. They were the same form. I can't really describe it, but I saw them at the same time. They shared the same spot in that room, but it was like looking at two separate dimensions. When I saw the girl I saw the form, and when I saw the form I saw the girl. I couldn't speak. I could barely even see. My mind was revolting against what it was attempting to process. I had been scared before in my life and I had never been more scared than when I was trapped in the fourth room, but that was before room six. I just stood there, staring at whatever it was that spoke to me. There was no exit. I was trapped here with it. And then it spoke again. "David, you should have listened." When it spoke, I heard the words of the little girl, but the other form spoke through my mind in a voice I won't attempt to describe. There was no other sound. The voice just kept repeating that sentence over and over in my mind and I agreed. I didn't know what to do. I was slipping into madness, yet couldn't take my eyes off what was in front of me. I dropped to the floor. I thought I had passed out, but the room wouldn't let me. I just wanted it to end. I was on my side, my eyes wide open and the form staring down at me. Scurrying across the floor in front of me was one of the battery-powered rats from the second room. The house was toying with me. But for some reason, seeing that rat pulled my mind back from whatever depths it was headed and I looked around the room. I was getting out of there. I was determined to get out of that house and live and never think about this place again. I knew this room was Hell and I wasn't ready to take up a residency. At first, it was just my eyes that moved. I searched the walls for any kind of opening. The room wasn't that big, so it didn't take long to soak up the entire layout. The demon still taunted me, the voice growing louder as the form stayed rooted where it stood. I placed my hand on the floor, lifted myself up to all four and turned to scan the wall behind me. Then I saw something I couldn't believe. The form was now right at my back, whispering into my mind how I shouldn't have come. I felt its breath on the back of my neck, but I refused to turn around. A large rectangle was scratched into the wood, with a small dent chipped away in the center of it. Right in front of my eyes I saw the large seven I had mindlessly etched into the wall. I knew what it was: room seven was just beyond that wall where room five was moments ago. I don't know how I had done it – maybe it was just my state of mind at the time – but I had created the door. I knew I had. In my madness, I had scratched into the wall what I needed the most: an exit to the next room. Room seven was close. I knew the demon was right behind me, but for some reason it couldn't touch me. I closed my eyes and placed both hands on the large seven in front of me. I pushed. I pushed as hard as I could. The demon was now screaming in my ear. It told me I was never leaving. It told me that this was the end but I wasn't going to die; I was going to live there in room six with it. I wasn't. I pushed and screamed at the top of my lungs. I knew I was going to push through the wall eventually. I clenched my eyes shut and screamed, and the demon was gone. I was left in silence. I turned around slowly and was greeted by the room as it was when I entered: just a chair and a lamp. I couldn't believe it, but I didn't have time to well. I turned back to the seven and jumped back slightly. What I saw was a door. It wasn't the one I had scratched in, but a regular door with a large seven on it. My whole body was shaking. It took me a while to turn the knob. I just stood there for a while, staring at the door. I couldn't stay in room six. I couldn't. But if this was only room six, I couldn't imagine was seven had in store. I must have stood there for an hour, just staring at the seven. Finally, with a deep breath, I twisted the knob and opened the door to room seven. I stumbled through the door mentally exhausted and physically weak. The door behind me closed and I realized where I was. I was outside. Not outside like room five, but actually outside. My eyes stung. I wanted to cry. I fell to my knees and tried but I couldn't. I was finally out of that hell. I didn't even care about the prize that was promised. I turned and saw that the door I just went through was the entrance. I walked to my car and drove home, thinking of how nice a shower sounded. As I pulled up to my house, I felt uneasy. The joy of leaving NoEnd House had faded and dread was slowly building in my stomach. I shook it off as residual from the house and made my way to the front door. I entered and immediately went up to my room. There on my bed was my cat, Baskerville. He was the first living thing I had seen all night and I reached to pet him. He hissed and swiped at my hand. I recoiled in shock, as he had never acted like that. I thought, "Whatever, he's an old cat." I jumped in the shower and got ready for what I was expecting to be a sleepless night. After my shower, I went to the kitchen to make something to eat. I descended the stairs and turned into the family room; what I saw would be forever burned into my mind, however. My parents were lying on the ground, naked and covered in blood. They were mutilated to near-unidentifiable states. Their limbs were removed and placed next to their bodies, and their heads were placed on their chests facing me. The most unsettling part was their expressions. They were smiling, as though they were happy to see me. I vomited and sobbed there in the family room. I didn't know what had happened; they didn't even live with me at the time. I was a mess. Then I saw it: a door that was never there before. A door with a large eight scrawled on it in blood. I was still in the house. I was standing in my family room but I was in room seven. The faces of my parents smiled wider as I realized this. They weren't my parents; they couldn't be, but they looked exactly like them. The door marked eight was across the room, behind the mutilated bodies in front of me. I knew I had to move on, but at that moment I gave up. The smiling faces tore into my mind; they grounded me where I stood. I vomited again and nearly collapsed. Then the hum returned. It was louder than ever and it filled the house and shook the walls. The hum compelled me to walk. I began to walk slowly, making my way closer to the door and the bodies. I could barely stand, let alone walk, and the closer I got to my parents the closer I came to suicide. The walls were now shaking so hard it seemed as though they were going to crumble, but still the faces smiled at me. As I inched closer, their eyes followed me. I was now between the two bodies, a few feet away from the door. The dismembered hands clawed their way across the carpet towards me, all while the faces continued to stare. New terror washed over me and I walked faster. I didn't want to hear them speak. I didn't want the voices to match those of my parents. They began to open their mouths and the hands were inches from my feet. In a dash of desperation, I lunged toward the door, threw it open, and slammed it behind me. Room eight. I was done. After what I had just experienced, I knew there wasn't anything else this fucking house could throw at me that I couldn't live through. There was nothing short of the fires of Hell that I wasn't ready for. Unfortunately, I underestimated the abilities of NoEnd House. Unfortunately, things got more disturbing, more terrifying, and more unspeakable in room eight. I still have trouble believing what I saw in room eight. Again, the room was a carbon copy of rooms three and six, but sitting in the usually empty chair was a man. After a few seconds of disbelief, my mind finally accepted the fact that the man sitting in the chair was me. Not someone who looked like me; it was David Williams. I walked closer. I had to get a better look even though I was sure of it. He looked up at me and I noticed tears in his eyes. "Please… please, don't do it. Please, don't hurt me." "What?" I asked. "Who are you? I'm not going to hurt you." "Yes you are…" He was sobbing now. "You're going to hurt me and I don't want you to." He sat in the chair with his legs up and began rocking back and forth. It was actually pretty pathetic looking, especially since he was me, identical in every way. "Listen, who are you?" I was now only a few feet from my doppelgänger. It was the weirdest experience yet, standing there talking to myself. I wasn't scared, but I would be soon. "Why are you-" "You're going to hurt me you're going to hurt me if you want to leave you're going to hurt me." "Why are you saying this? Just calm down, alright? Let's try and figure this-" And then I saw it. The David sitting down was wearing the same clothes as me, except for a small red patch on his shirt embroidered with the number nine. "You're going to hurt me you're going to hurt me don't please you're going to hurt me…" My eyes didn't leave that small number on his chest. I knew exactly what it was. The first few doors were plain and simple, but after a while they got a little more ambiguous. Seven was scratched into the wall, but by my own hands. Eight was marked in blood above the bodies of my parents. But nine – this number was on a person, a living person. Worse still, it was on a person that looked exactly like me. "David?" I had to ask. "Yes… you're going to hurt me you're going to hurt me…" He continued to sob and rock. He answered to David. He was me, right down to the voice. But that nine. I paced around for a few minutes while he sobbed in his chair. The room had no door and, similarly to room six, the door I came through was gone. For some reason, I assumed that scratching would get me nowhere this time. I studied the walls and floor around the chair, sticking my head underneath and seeing if anything was below. Unfortunately, there was. Below the chair was a knife. Attached was a tag that read, "To David – From Management." The feeling in my stomach as I read that tag was something sinister. I wanted to throw up and the last thing I wanted to do was remove that knife from under that chair. The other David was still sobbing uncontrollably. My mind was spinning into an attic of unanswerable questions. Who put this here and how did they get my name? Not to mention the fact that as I knelt on the cold wood floor I also sat in that chair, sobbing in protest of being hurt by myself. It was all too much to process. The house and the management had been playing with me this whole time. My thoughts for some reason turned to Peter and whether or not he got this far. If he did, if he met a Peter Terry sobbing in this very chair, rocking back and forth… I shook those thoughts out of my head; they didn't matter. I took the knife from under the chair and immidately the other David went quiet. "David," He said in my voice, "What do you think you're going to do?" I lifted myself from the ground and clenched the knife in my hand. "I'm going to get out of here." David was still sitting in the chair, though he was very calm now. He looked up at me with a slight grin. I couldn't tell if he was going to laugh or strangle me. Slowly, he got up from the chair and stood, facing me. It was uncanny. His height and even the way he stood matched mine. I felt the rubber hilt of the knife in my hand and gripped it tighter. I don't know what I was planning on doing with it, but I had a feeling I was going to need it. "Now," his voice was slightly deeper than my own. "I'm going to hurt you. I'm going to hurt you and I'm going to keep you here." I didn't respond. I just lunged and tackled him to the ground. I had mounted him and looked down, knife poised and ready. He looked up at me, terrified. It was like I was looking in a mirror. Then the hum returned, low and distant, though I still felt it deep in my body. David looked up at me as I looked down at myself. The hum was getting louder and I felt something inside me snap. With one motion, I slammed the knife into the patch on his chest and ripped down. Blackness fell on the room and I was falling. The darkness around me was like nothing I had experienced up to that point. Room four was dark, but it didn't come close to what was completely engulfing me. I wasn't even sure if I was falling after a while. I felt weightless, covered in dark. Then a deep sadness came over me. I felt lost, depressed, and suicidal. The sight of my parents entered my mind. I knew it wasn't real, but I had seen it and the mind has trouble differentiating between what is real and what isn't. The sadness only deepened. I was in room nine for what seemed like days. The final room. And that's exactly what it was: the end. NoEnd House had an end and I had reached it. At that moment, I gave up. I knew I would be in that in-between state forever, accompanied by nothing but darkness. Not even the hum was there to keep me sane. I had lost all senses. I couldn't feel myself. I couldn't hear anything. Sight was completely useless here. I searched for a taste in my mouth and found nothing. I felt disembodied and completely lost. I knew where I was. This was Hell. Room nine was Hell. Then it happened. A light. One of those stereotypical lights at the end of the tunnel. I felt ground come up from below me and I was standing. After a moment or two of gathering my thoughts and senses, I slowly walked toward that light. As I approached the light, it took form. It was a vertical slit down the side of an unmarked door. I slowly walked through the door and found myself back where I started: the lobby of NoEnd House. It was exactly how I left it: still empty, still decorated with childish Halloween decorations. After everything that had happened that night, I was still wary of where I was. After a few moments of normalcy, I looked around the place trying to find anything different. On the desk was a plain white envelope with my name handwritten on it. Immensely curious, yet still cautious, I mustered up the courage to open the envelope. Inside was a letter, again handwritten. David Williams, Congratulations! You have made it to the end of NoEnd House! Please accept this prize as a token of great achievement. Yours forever, Management. With the letter were five $100 bills. I couldn't stop laughing. I laughed for what seemed like hours. I laughed as I walked out to my car and laughed as I drove home. I laughed as I pulled into my driveway. I laughed as I opened my front door to my house and laughed as I saw the small ten etched into the wood. The word "bigly" has been recognized as one of Donald Trump's many favorite buzzwords, or "Trumpism" as they became known to be, since the beginning of his presidential campaign in June 2015. During his presidential announcement speech, Trump was quoted as saying "Obamacare kicks in in 2016 really bigly." On July 4th, 2015 YouTuber John Doe submitted a video featuring Trump's quote and a text-to-speech reading of the text.  In August 2004, LazyTown was first broadcast on the Nick Jr. block on the Nickelodeon television channel. In the show, Robbie is depicted as the primary antagonist, attempting to make everyone lazy so that he may have peace and quiet. He is usually able to succeed for a while, using various disguises and inventions to trick the citizens and sabotage Sportacus.

Several films using stop motion techniques were produced in the early 1900s including Fun in a Bakery Shop (1902), The Haunted Hotel (1907) and Sculptor’s Welsh Rarebit Nightmare (1908), and "The Lost World" (1925 / shown below, left). In 1965, animator Eliot Noyes Jr. developed stop motion clay animation with his film Clay (or Origin of Species). In the 1970s, the technique was employed in sci-fi and children's fantasy productions, from George Lucas' Star Wars trilogy and the 1984 action blockbuster Terminator to The Adventures of Mark Twain and Tim Burton's 1993 musical fantasy film The Nightmare Before Christmas (shown above, right). Beginning in the mid-2000s, the advents of digital photography and video-editing software programs led to an explosion of creative stop motion projects on the web.     The origins of electoral college map parodies and edits can be traced to the 2004 election, when demotivational posters and image macros used maps of the electoral college to mock Jesusland, a term used to mock Middle America which at the time voted with strong conservative and Christian beliefs. On December 6th, 2006, CollegeHumor released a parody commercial titled "Girl's Costume Wearhouse," featuring women modeling a variaty of "sexy" costumes (shown below).

Tedesco is a very popular character from the telenovela Senhora do Destino in Brazil. A clip of her intensely thinking about a situation inspired the meme (shown below, left). Because of her comical personality, images of her have been photoshopped into reaction images and image macros. On Facebook, there is a fan page devoted to posting such pictures of her.[2] The earliest known example of the original gif being used as a reaction image is from October 31st, 2013, when UKMix forum poster CrazyCrazy posted the gif with the caption "I'm sure there is better music to hear while you wait for Beywance…" (shown below, right).[3] The second presidential debate of the 2016 United States Presidential Election had a town hall format, meaning that the candidates sat in the middle of the stage and fielded questions from vetted undecided voters in the audience. Unlike other debates, the candidates were not standing at a podium and held microphones as they walked around the stage. Photos of the candidates talking into their microphones at the same time spread around the internet as Twitter users made jokes about how the candidates appeared to be singing a karaoke duet. Twitter user @Moochie_BMN[1] tweeted one of the first examples, shown below, and gained over 43,000 retweets and 73,000 favorites.  The gift basket of Exotic Butters is an item obtained on the fifth night of the fifth Five Nights at Freddy's game, Five Nights at Freddy's: Sister Location. Your robotic guide, the Model V Handyman's Robotics and Unit Repair System (usually shortened to HandUnit) awards you for completing your first week by giving you a gift basket. He then flips up a keypad to allow you to enter the kind of gift basket you want. As part of a running gag, the keypad fails and HandUnit "autocorrects" it to Exotic Butters. If one were to complete the secret ending of the game and complete the fifth night, your Exotic Butters award will be laying on your television set as you watch the final episode of your favourite cartoon, The Immortal and the Restless. In the extras menu, the basket of Exotic Butters will be there. It will repeat HandUnit's out-loud autocorrection when left-clicked. On November 23rd, 2010, YouTuber hardlynewsblog uploaded a video titled "Trumpet From a Tube," in which a man shows how attaching a mouthpiece to a length of tubing allows for a wider range of notes (shown below).

On the night of October 9th, 2016, at approximately 9:19 p.m. (EST), a house fly landed on the face of Hillary Clinton during her two-minute response to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's counter-accusations of misogyny against her husband and former United States president Bill Clinton at the height of the Monica Lewinsky scandal in 1999. CLINTON: Well, first, let me start by saying that so much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign, [a fly lands on her face] any way he chooses. He gets to decide what he wants to talk about. During the second presidential general election debate held on October 9th, 2016, Trump was seen following behind Clinton as the two candidates roamed the debate stage (shown below). The evening, Twitter users began posting screencaptured images of Trump standing behind Clinton, along with captions mocking his behavior as creepy (shown below). The original video was uploaded to YouTube around December 15th, 2012 by the user radomkropkaws, an owner of the website radom.ws devoted to Radom[1]. It was filmed during the 2012 installment of "Gwiazdka na deptaku" ("Christmas Eve on the walkway"), a yearly public Christmas Eve celebration organized by the authorities of Radom. The video depicts a crowd of people who, faced with several tables' worth of complimentary food and drink, begin grabbing as much as possible for themselves and empty the tables completely within 30 seconds. One person in particular caught the viewers' attention – an elderly woman (at 0:10 in the below video) who repeatedly leans across the table to grab all the available bottles of drink (specifically, a citrus drink named "Zbyszko 3 Cytryny"). This woman later became known as the Chytra baba z Radomia ("Cunning lady from Radom"). (Note: This is a reupload of the original video, which has been deleted.) The first Posh Reading video was posted to YouTube by user MrTennek on June 25th, 2009.

On March 21st, 2016, The New York Daily News[1] reported that the MTA was rolling out a new series of ads as part of their long running "If you see something, say something" campaign that encourages New Yorkers to report suspicious activity in order to keep the city safe. The new ads would feature testimonials from New Yorkers who have reported suspicious activity in an effort to put a human face on the campaign. One of those people was lawyer Gregg Turkin, who reported when he saw a suspicious group of cars while riding the Long Island Railroad. Cruz fought a contentious campaign against Trump in the primary. Trump had famously dubbed Cruz "Lyin' Ted," insulted his wife, and insinuated his father had a role in the assassination of former president John F. Kennedy. Despite this, and Cruz famously refusing to endorse Trump at the 2016 Republican National Convention, Cruz eventually endorsed Trump in a Facebook post[2] on September 23rd, 2016. On October 5th, 2016, Ted Cruz phone-banked on behalf of Republican candidates in Texas. The Dallas Morning News[1] caught footage of Cruz leaving a voicemail to a voter while sitting in front of posters for Donald Trump.

The concept of single-themed serial art projects has existed prior to the emergence of microblogging services and social networking platforms, perhaps most commonly as part of curriculum or class assignments in art education. As early as in 2006, graphic designer Michael Bierut[7] has been instructing a workshop course called "100 Days" at the Yale School of Art, which requires each student to create a body of work over the span of 100 days. On the web, there has been similar projects and community games like the Hourly Comic Day and Photo a Day Challenge. The original 30 Day Challenge was posted by Tumblr blogger Zachintosh[1] on February 25th, 2010. Since the upload of original post, it has accumulated nearly 2,000 notes (as of June 2011).

Seven years later, on September 12th, 2007, Counter-Strike premiered on Steam, providing access to people throughout the world, including in Russia.[1] The exact origin of the meme is unknown. However, the earliest known usage of the term comes from a YouTube video entitled "Counter Strike;Source rush B (GameArmy) Russian server," YouTuber didalone published on August 11th, 2010 (shown below).   Pen spinning was originally popularized in Japan in the 1970s. In 1997, Japanese pen spinner Hideaki Kondoh created the first pen spinning website on Geocities.[4] In 2000, the English language pen spinning enthusiast site Pentix[5] was launched by spinner Fernan Kuo (a.k.a. Kam), who subsequently shutdown the site indefinitely in 2003. The conspiracy began with a video by SourceFed[1] posted on June 9th, 2016 (shown below) that suggested Google was actively helping the Clinton campaign by blocking negative autocomplete searches. For example, they noticed searching "Hillary Clinton Cri" did not autocomplete to "Hillary Clinton Criminal Investigation" like it did on competing search engine sites Yahoo and Bing, and extrapolated on this observation to suggest Google was in cahoots with the Clinton campaign. The first known appearance of the "emoji spell" concept appeared on October 29th, 2015, when Vice's women's interest sub-site Broadly[3] published an article called "How to Cast Spells Using Emoji" as a part of "Witch Week." The article featured directions for crafting, casting, and preparing for casting a spell, along with several example spells one can cast.

Following the basic definition of God being a superhuman spirit, the concept of a God would have come from animism. Animism is commonly held as the first religion starting arguably around 100,000BC with the first recorded burial act in Qafzeh cave.[3] It is also one of the broadest religions because it is the belief that a soul or spirit exists in every living being and object including inanimate ones.[2] The traditional definition of God being an omnipotent omniscient being with supreme authority and judgement comes from Aristotle's Metaphysics[4] from 350BC[6] which is considered one of the most important metaphysical works in all of philosophy.[5] In the book[7] Aristotle conceives of the nature of God: And life also belongs to God; for the actuality of thought is life, and God is that actuality; and God’s self-dependent actuality is life most good and eternal. We say therefore that God is a living being, eternal, most good, so that life and duration continuous and eternal belong to God; for this is God.  The concept of a Patronus was introduced in the third installment of the Harry Potter series, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Using the incantation "Expecto Patronum," wizards can ward off "dementors," soul sucking creatures that can only be stopped with powerful, happy memories. On September 22nd, 2016, Pottermore introduced a quiz allowing fans to discover what would be their Patronus.[1] After taking the quiz, which can only be taken once, users are invited to post their results to social media using the hashtag #ExpectoPatronum.

On May 26th, 2014, Tumblr user The Frogman published a post denouncing the Men's Rights Movement in the context of the 2014 Isla Vista killings. At the end of the post, he compared violent men to a percentage of poisoned M&Ms in a bowl.[2] "You say not all men are monsters? Imagine a bowl of M&Ms. 10% of them are poisoned. Go ahead. Eat a handful. Not all M&Ms are poison." While similar variations of the game have long been popular online, one of the earliest known instances of the "three fictional characters" variations appeared on October 1st, 2014, when DeviantArt user AshAttempts posted a thread to the site's forums titled "If you had to describe yourself using three fictional characters, who would you choose and why?"[1]   On September 18th, 2016, Twitter user @Doonadraws introduced the hashtag #RedrawReigen with two original drawings of Arataka Reigen imitating stock photographs[1][3] of a man eating salad and a woman pointing a gun at a goldfish.

In the song, Jepsen sings "I'm just goin' to the store" in lyrics describing a painful breakup (shown below). On February 17th, 2016, the Facebook page for Horse.com[5] uploaded the picture. It has over 2,600 reactions as of September 7th, 2016. Twerking has been around since the 90’s, with the emergence of Southern hip hop and crunk genre in particular. However, the term itself didn’t start gaining prominence until after the new millennium, with early influences from "Whistle While You Twurk" (shown below) by Ying Yang Twins and "Twerk a Little" by Bubba Sparxx. According to an article in The Age,[1] the term "twerk" is thought to be an amalgamation of the words "twist," "jerk" and "footwork." On April 6th, 2002, Online Slang Dictionary[12] user Brandon submitted an entry for "twerk": "v. to dance in a sexual manner, usually involving shaking on the buttocks." On July 5th, 2006, user jit_gohil posted a thread to the forum "ZBrush Central", a forum for the digital sculpting tool. The thread was titled "Beware the Orangeman", and was a user showing off Mr. Orange or Orangeman, gaining 17 replies. [1] Mr. Krabs first appeared in the pilot episode of Spongebob Squarepants, “Help Wanted,” which aired May 1st, 1999[1] (clip shown below). On July 17th, 2016, YouTuber iDubbbz uploaded a video (below) titled "Disabled Pokemon Go – Eevee + Zubat" to his secondary channel, iDubbbzTV2.[1] It obtained over 1,600,000 views, 4,500 comments, and 65,000 likes in about a month and a half.   The image of the alien has circulated the web since as early as November 2012, appearing on a number of Portuguese and Spanish-language paranormal sites including Tempo Espaço[1], El Gurú[2] and El Rincon Paranormal.[3] Though it is unclear where the photo was first posted, it was referenced on Twitter on March 31st, 2013 in a conversation between two users. Every time I see that damn alien "ayy lmao" I lose it  The first Internet meme template, and by extension the first Internet meme, was arguably spam. The first example of "spamming" on a form of the Internet can be traced back to a mass email sent out by a Digital Equipment Corporation employee dated May 1st, 1978.[10] Spam as a term is based on a Monty Python sketch in which the 'spam' appears on every item in a menu, complete with a Spam Song (shown below).[20] The template for the spam/spamming meme is the act sending the same message repeatedly, often indiscriminately to multiple users which causes annoyance. Spam became popularized as a meme in the early 90s. The Nutshack edits were preceded by Noun Replacement, a relatively short-lived YouTube Poop meme that involved replacing all nouns in a clip with a certain word, such as "toasters" or "dinner" (shown below). On July 30th, 2016, YouTuber Ringabel submitted a video titled "Hotel Mario every noun replaced with the entire nutshack theme" (shown below). Over the next two months, the video received upwards of 41,000 views and 300 comments.  The earliest gif found is from the film Mission Impossible III released in 2006, the long take of Tom Cruise Running. The gif was made by an anonymous user in the site MakeAGIF which was uploaded in 2007.[1] On October 31st, 1986, Bon Jovi released the single "Livin' on a Prayer" off their third studio album Slippery When Wet, which features the lyrics "Woah, we're half way there / Woah, livin' on a prayer" during the chorus (shown below). On August 22nd, 2016, Twitter user @peachesanscream[1] posted a picture of an iguana sitting in a chair with the caption "Whoa, we're halfway there… Woah-oh…" (shown below). Within 10 days, the tweet gained over 4,100 likes and 3,200 retweets. On August 11th, 2016, Joshi published a lengthy blog post on her Facebook page, claiming that she was "sexually harassed" while protesting the building of a police station at the Seattle city hall.[1] At the bottom of the post, Joshi included video footage of Pantoja identifying himself as "Hugh Mungus," which she interprets as a reference to his penis (shown below). That same guy then sexually harassed me. And when I asked him why he was sexually harassing me, he kept doing it. When I raised my voice and told everyone what he was doing, he ran away. The security guards, who witnessed everything, then accosted me to tell me to be quiet. When I asked them why they were going after me instead of the man who sexually harassed me, they called the cops ON ME. The cops were already there, of course. They didn't go after the man who'd sexually harassed me. When I asked them to at least take notes of what happened and why they were not going after the man who sexually harassed me, they said that I should speak with one of their officers alone. They didn't take any notes, they didn't even send one man to go look out for the guy while this conversation was going on for over ten minutes. The officers stood there with their hands on their guns until a white man asked why they had their hands on their guns. Why were they holding their guns while talking to a woman of color who was sexually harassed? Why would they ask that woman of color to go alone with them to talk to them, while holding those guns? I refused to leave the safety of my community to speak to a cop alone and it was only when another person – an older white male – spoke up, that the cop decided to take down my description of my harasser and I showed them some of this video. I was sexually harassed and then criminalized because I wouldn't shut up about being sexually harassed. And the city wants to give these cops $160 million dollars to build a military bunker to "protect us". The cops didn't protect me. They didn't look out for me. They didn't give a damn. Why would they? They're part of a gang that molests and criminalizes innocent people all the time. And by the way, the guy who sexually harassed me made a public comment that was pro-bunker and PRO-COP. The cops are definitely not going to go after him. After this all happened, I went to the city council offices with community members to make a formal complaint about how the security guards treated me. Here's the thing: The security guards are not public employees. They're employed by a private company. Lorena Gonzalez's aide Brianna came out, listened to what I said, and then told me that I must have orchestrated this…as if I organized my own sexual harassment and criminalization. I asked her to find out the accountability process for security guards, since they're not city employees. She told me that she'd done a lot to try to help me and she said that she didn't have time today to do more. We were all so stunned by this that there was silence in the room after she said this. All she'd done was sit down and not answer my questions. She wrote down a number and pushed it to me across the table, foisting me off on another department. I asked to speak with Council Member Lorena González regarding this, Brianna said she could "probably" do that. When I asked when this meeting would be, she said: "Oh, now this has gone from a phone call to a meeting?" as if I was too demanding. She said that I would hear back by 5pm but only after I asked, repeatedly, when I would hear from them. At present, it's 9pm, and I've heard nothing from any of them. Kshama Sawant's aide Ted came in to the room to help, as did Jesse, Mike O'Brien's aide. They were more compassionate and forthcoming with information then anything Brianna said but it seems like there is no accountability process. Private security guards in our tax-payer funded city hall don't answer to anyone. Why did no one stop the man who sexually harassed me? Why are the security guards in city hall private employees and not accountable to the public? Why was I told to be quiet when I was sexually harassed? Why was I subjected to intimidation and physical threat from the cops? Why was Lorena González's aide Brianna so callous and dismissive? Why are the cops getting $160 million dollars to build a militarized fortress when they can't even catch one sexual harasser when he's right in front of them? What would have happened to me if the community hadn't been there to witness? Call here to complain about Lorena González's aide: 206 684 8802. Call here to complain to the private security company: 206 233 7812 Call here to complain to the City about the private security company: 206 684 CITY Call here to complain about the racist and threatening cops: 206 625 5011* *Sidenote: I think it likely that the cops or someone will come after me, so if anything happens to me, please don't think it was an accident. #Patriarchy #Racism #Capitalism #BlockTheBunker The original "Hang In There, Baby" poster (shown below) was published in late 1971 by photographer Victor Baldwin. He got the shot of his Siamese cat, Sassy, in 1963, and published the image in a book called Outcast Kittens in 1970. He made the poster after choosing the caption "Hang in there, baby" in 1971. The first known usage was on April 18th, 2016, when Facebook page Green de la Bean posted the original (shown below), with a watermark on it.[2] It has obtained nearly 5,000 likes, 7,000 shares, and about 100,000 comments as of September 6th, 2016.  On August 31st, 2016, the starwarsmovies Instagram feed posted a photograph of the C2-B5 (shown below). Within 24 hours, the post gained over 27,000 likes and 320 comments. The name and original concept for bait-and-switch media online stem from the term "bait-and-switch," which originated as a form of fraud in retail sales and commercial culture. The oldest text mentioning the use of this technique comes from Zhang Yingyu's The Book of Swindles, released in 1617, a Chinese book of stories about fraud.[1] One of the earliest and most well-known examples of this technique being used online comes from the viral video "Ghost Car" that was released in 2005. In this commercial, viewers are shown a serene landscape with a car driving through rolling green hills when suddenly a monster appears and screams to shock viewers. The video was uploaded on July 30th, 2005, by YouTuber[2] mrsmithereen and has since been viewed over 37.5 million times in roughly 15 and a half years (seen below). Easily the most infamous bait-and-switch video, Rickrolling originated shortly after in 2006 and quickly became the most popularized method of duping people with the technique. YouTuber[3] Erik Helwig, better known as Hot Dad, claimed to have prank called a Michigan radio station after a sports game and played "Never Gonna Give You Up" over the phone on August 31st, 2006. The story was explained in a YouTube video titled "I Did the First Rickroll (w/ Proof)" uploaded on August 7th, 2015 (shown below).  The earliest version of the copypasta was posted to the 4chan messageboard /mu/[10] on June 29th, 2012. It reads: It reads: I saw Flying Lotus at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.  The redraws are inspired by a picture of a male seen sneaking a drink from another girl's cup while she is busy kissing a different male. Although the background of the picture is unknown, many viewers saw the drinking guy to represent a third wheel, the person remaining in a group of three out of which two are in a romantic relationship, who was photobombing the picture. The original picture can most likely no longer be traced back, and over time various versions and qualities have been spread, but searches show that the picture was already shared as early as 2007[1][2] with increasing spread in the following few years. On July 6th, 2015, Tumblr user Bumbleshark posted a "Draw The OTP" post featuring the specific image,[3] starting a series of replies featuring pairings in the style of the photograph; which managed to gather over 128,000 notes as of September 2016.   On March 17th, 2015, the page "Рыбы пытаются читать" (translation: "Fish are Trying to Read") published its first post on Russian social media site, VK.com.[1] The image of a fish trying to read and expressing frustration (shown below) has gained over 7,500 likes and 470 shares as of August 31st, 2016. The page solely posted pictures of fish expressing their difficulty reading. On October 4th, 2010, Flame posted a video titled "Flockaveli TV – Episode 4 (Waka Flocka in the Studio with Yo Gotti)" to his official YouTube channel, in which he is shown repeating the word "bow" in a recording booth while working on his 2010 rap song "Bustin' at Em" (shown below). Within six years, the video gained over 200,000 views and 350 comments.  The edits are inspired by the racing anime series Initial D, which gained notoriety due its eurobeat soundtrack, a dance-pop musical style developed in the 80's.[1] On July 19th, 2014, YouTuber Inkerlink uploaded a scene from the 2006 action film Fast & Furious: Tokyo Drift with the eurobeat song Dancing in the Street by David Dima. In the following two years, the song gained over 3,000 views. "Midnight City" was released on August 14th, 2011 as the first single off M83's sixth studio album, Hurry Up, We're Dreaming, released October 18th of the same year.[1] Upon its initial release as a single, "Midnight City" peaked at number 8 in France (SNEP), number 2 in UK Indie (Official Charts Company) and number 5 in U.S. Alternative Songs (Billboard). The song was eventually named the best song of 2011 by Pitchfork and Popmatters.  On August 11th 2016, Nintendo released a trailer on YouTube revealing the villain group Team Skull in Pokémon Sun and Moon, which included a clip of the leader Guzma (shown below). Within three weeks, the video gained over 2.84 million views and 11,300 comments. On August 27th, 2016, a 7-second video of a man vigorously masturbating between a McDonald's hamburger bun began circulating on Vine.[1] Although the original video was subsequently removed, mirrors were immediately reuploaded on a variety of websites. Additionally, a censored, audio-only version was uploaded by YouTuber TheCrazyGinger (shown below). On September 1st, 2016, Gutierrez appeared on MSNBCs All In with Chris Hayes to discuss Trump's comments made during an immigration speech on August 31st, 2016.[1] While discussing "problems" faced by America, correspondent Joy Ann Reid pushed Gutierrez to clarify "What problems?" Gutierrez responded: "My culture is a very dominant culture, and it is imposing, and it is causing problems. If you don't do something about it you are going to have taco trucks on every corner." A "Millennials are Killing X" trend piece generally involves a writer from the Boomer generation noting that millennials' financial situation (high student loans, lack of available, well-paying jobs) have made millennials unwilling or unable to spend as freely as their ancestors, and that this phenomenon is hurting either a specific industry or the American economy as a whole. Backlash to the trend began in 2013, notably with the response to Time Magazine's infamous Me Me Me Generation cover. Gothamist[1] and The New York Times[2] published articles compiling and criticizing Boomer pieces criticizing Millennials the same year. On August 24th, Twitter user @kLodeserto[1] launched the hashtag in a tweet saying "#AltRightMeans not being ashamed of being white" (shown below). Within 48 hours, the tweet gathered more than 140 likes and 70 retweets. On August 7th, 2016, a Youtube user called Southern Lights[4] uploaded a video in which Charizard and Dragonite dance to J-Pop group, Gokaru Jodo. The video, which was created by MMDSatoshi[11] with the software MikuMikuDance,[2] gained over 73,000 views as of August 30th, 2016.  On June 29th, 1999, the single "Smooth" was released, spending a total of 12 weeks in the top position on the Billboard Hot 100 that year. A music video for the song uploaded to the SantanaVEVO YouTube channel accumulated over 40.9 million views and 4,300 comments within three years (shown below).   The commenter, known as Instagram handle "quadirgray," remarked "Dan Nicky your Bobbie s" on a Minaj selfie posted on December 5th, 2014.[3] It was the first of an unearthed sea of similar expressions (shown below).[1]  On August 17th, 2016, an anonymous 4chan user submitted a collage of various grocery store customers with brown stains on the backside on their pants with the caption "mfw americunts shit in public / shart in mart" (shown below).  On September 7th, 2011, YouTuber gNarLu cEe uploaded footage of a group of young cybergoths dancing underneath an overpass titled "Cybergoth Dance Party" (shown below). Over the next five years, the video gained over 4.2 million views and 11,800 comments. In January 2012, a mustachioed Michael Cera was photographed at the Nintendo 3DS Experience Lounge at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah (shown below, left). On August 21st, 2015, Imgur[1] user ANewBadlyPhotoshoppedPhotoofMichaelCeraEveryday uploaded a photoshopped picture of Leonardo da Vinci's 15-century portrait Mona Lisa superimposed with a cut-out of Cera's face from the Sundance photo (shown below, right). On March 7th, 2016, Tumblr user godh8sfags2[4] uploaded an image titled "Choose Your Class," featuring several stock photos of an elderly woman holding a variety of objects, with each image assigned to a different role-playing game character class (shown below). Within five months, the post gathered upwards of 164,000 notes. The earliest known instance of the image was submitted by Redditor Gennycraig in a /r/WTF post titled "Smoked Chicken" on January 23rd, 2012. The post garnered 571 points prior to being archived. Sponsored by McDonald's and starring Michael Jordan, the anti-drug public service announcement premiered on ABC at the end of the network's anti-drug TV special program Cracked Up that originally aired on May 26th, 1987. In the minute-long video, Jordan urges teenagers to stay away from doing drugs, while pleading those with substance abuse problems to "stop it" and "get some help." The earliest digital copy of the original video was uploaded by YouTuber EightiesTV on February 4th, 2010. DNA Productions created the mascot. After the end credits of the first Jimmy Neutron episode "When Pants Attack" a monkey named Paul with three eyes and said "Hi i'm Paul!" to the audience. (Shown Below)   SSB is a fighting video game series developed by Nintendo which features a growing cast of iconic characters, including Mario, Pikachu, Donkey Kong. On July 14th, 2006, Neoseeker Forums member guilmon93950 submitted a thread titled “Should They Include Jimmy Neutron?” in the “Super Smash Bros. Brawl” board, receiving over 60 replies before it was closed 72 hours later.  In 1996, Kirby Super Star was released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (or Super Famicom in Japan). The game features a variety of mini-games, including the Gourmet Race mini-game. The mini-game features a musical track, composed by Jun Ishikawa and often titled Gourmet Race, that has since been featured in other Kirby games as well as remixed in fan covers, MAD videos, and YouTube Poop Music Videos (YTPMVs for short). The track was remixed in the Nintendo 64 game Super Smash Bros., where it was used as the theme for the Dream Land stage (shown below, left). On March 7th, 2015, YouTuber Tim Piper uploaded footage of a group of goth teenagers dancing under an overpass dubbed with the Dream Land theme (shown below, right). On his official Twitter feed,[1] Dawkins is shown wearing a T-shirt with the expression "We Are All Africans" printed on the front, an item which is sold by the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason & Science[8] (shown below, left). On February 27th, 2014, Dawkins tweeted "We are all African apes. That's what my T-shirt means" (shown below, right). Within three years, the tweet gained over 370 retweets and 330 likes.[1] On February 5th, 2015, Tumblr[9] user wifuthief posted an edited version of the photograph with the phrase "we are all shitposters" photoshopped on the front (shown below). Within two years, the post gained over 25,400 notes. In October 2015, Canadian advertising executives and athletes Jessica Schnurr and Hannah Smit launched the official campaign website[3] with the hashtag banner #CoverTheAthlete,[6] which seeks to raise awareness about “sexist commentary, inappropriate interview questions and articles” focused solely on the physical appearance of female athletes. According to Schnurr, they decided to address the issue after watching a video clip of a post-game TV interview at the 2015 Australian Open tournament (shown below, left). On October 28th, 2015, an audio-dubbed satire video featuring a montage of male athletes looking baffled by irrelevant questions about their private lives from mock sportscasters and interviews, juxtaposed with the interview of Eugenie Bouchard at the 2015 Australian Open in which the reporter asks Canadian tennis player Eugenie Bouchard to "give a twirl and talk about her outfit. Over the next year, the video gained over 1.68 million views and 760 comments (shown below, right). Prior to the internet, the image of a downtrodden figure sucking on a cigarette was popularized by noir films.[3] One of the more popular examples of the "I haven't heard that name in a long time" cliché comes from Star Wars, when Obi-wan Kenobi is asked about his true name by Luke Skywalker. One of the earliest examples of "Haven't heard that name in years" as a joke format is a tweet by @DoctorJeph,[4] who used it in a tweet making a Thomas the Tank Engine joke. The tweet, shown below, has over 27,000 retweets and 42,000 likes as of August 19th, 2016. Pokémon Diamond and Pokémon Pearl were released in September 2006 in Japan and throughout 2007 for the rest of the world, marking the launch of the fourth generation of Pokémon video games. The belief that there will be remakes of these games stems from the fact that there had been remakes of the Pokemon generations prior to Diamond and Pearl. After the launch of Pokémon Omega Ruby and Pokémon Alpha Sapphire, people began posting about potential Diamond and Pearl remakes with the same tenor as Hoenn Confirmed, with people satirically creating elaborate conspiracies based off small details to back their theory. The earliest known post suggesting "Sinnoh Confirmed" was posted May 17th, 2014 by DeviantArt[1] user BattlePyramid (shown below).  On July 7th, 2008, artist O'Melissokomos uploaded an illustration of a very muscular version of the Kingdom Hearts character Riku to the Choose Your Own Change[6] database (shown below). On January 14th, 2015, YouTuber Big Mac uploaded footage of a high school student performing a rap about sausage, launching into the song with the phrase "Everybody say 'sausage' keep it going" (shown below). Within two years, the video gained over 1.2 million views and 330 comments. "Everybody say sausage keep it going, grits with the cheese with the eggs with the sausage, and I done climbed out that bitch fire with the sausage, say I'm riding out the mothafuckin trap with the sausage, say sau sau sau sau sau sau sausage, said keep it on going lil mama gotta sausage, bout to give that hoe that mothafuckin sausage, say sau sau sau sau sau sausage, said sau saue saue sau sau sausage, keep it on going ima ride on the (sausaaaage)" ＳＨＯＫＫ青 posted "You Reposted In the Wrong Neighborhood" to Soundcloud on March 24th, 2014. As of August 17th, 2016, the song has over 689,000 plays. Two to the one from the one to the three I like good pussy and I like good tree Smoke so much weed you wouldn't believe And I get more ass than a toilet seat While it's unclear when the song was first used in a remix video (reddit users on threads in /r/OutofTheLoop[6] and /r/youtubehaiku[7] are baffled), one of the earliest examples is a video[3] posted by Youtuber Rene Descartes on August 11th, 2015 called "umaru goes hard" (re-upload shown below). On June 19th, 2015, Trump tweeted that The Today Show host Brian Williams was "very sad!" after watching an episode of the morning talk show (shown below).[7] While the advent of the internet allowed people to share funny Olympic athlete names with each other, it wasn't until 2008, when NBC began to stream the Olympics online[2] and thus allow online viewers to screencap the coverage and save pictures of athletes with unusual names, that the phenomenon of "Unusual Olympic Athlete Names" began to start spreading. Until then, blogs cataloguing funny names in sports had included Olympians alongside American sports players, such as when the blog List of the Day[1] published an article called "The Ten Dirtiest Names in Sports," which included Olympic basketball player Gregor Fucka and Olympic swimmer Misty Hyman.  On January 13th, 2016,[1] Crowder tweeted the picture of Emelianenko along with a short caption describing it as "the ideal make [sic] body." (shown below). However, Crowder's tweet didn't draw any major attention until August 16th, 2016, when popular video-editing comedian Vic Berger IV mocked a tweet by Crowder that said "There is an epidemic of young, very portly girls dressing quite whorish. Unsettling." Twitter user @playazball[2] replied to Vic Berger IV's tweet with screenshot of Crowder's "ideal male body" tweet captioned "and for you men, take note of what Steven feels is the ideal body," inspiring the spread of the joke (shown below). On August 15th, 2016, Shaunae Miller dove into the finish line at the end of the women's 400-meter final to cross right before the American sprinter Allyson Felix (shown below). Following the race, Miller was awarded the gold medal with a time of 49.44. On January 6th, 2015, The Daily Mail[7] published an article reporting that Bill Clinton was included in contact lists owned by American financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which included a WireImage photograph of Clinton (shown below, left). On May 8th, 2016, Redditor KansasCityChefs posted a photoshopped version of the image titled "This is what happens when Hillary gets too close to the Presidency," in which Clinton appears to have reddened eyes (shown below, right). Within three months, the post gained over 1,200 votes (86% upvoted) and 60 comments. The American reality television series Pawn Stars was originally released in July 2009 on the History channel. During the show's opening sequence, pawn shop owner Rick Harrison introduces the store and his family. A copypasta of the opening is rumored to have originated on 4chan sometime in February 2010, though the archived thread is no longer available.[6] On May 6th, 2011, YouTuber Adfx0225 uploaded the intro (shown below). "I'm Rick Harrison, and this is my pawn shop. I work here with my old man and my son, Big Hoss. Everything in here has a story and a price. One thing I've learned after 21 years – you never know WHAT is gonna come through that door." On Wednesday, August 17th, 2016, Cohen appeared on CNN's The Situation Room to address a recent shakeup in the Trump campaign staff. Host Brianna Keilar observed "You guys are down," to which Cohen interrupted, "Says who?" Keilar responded "Polls. Most of them. All of them?" After a long pause, Cohen repeated, "Says who?", sparking the spread of the joke. On August 13th, 2016, Twitter user @aktfps[1] tweeted a picture of her cat, Milk-chan, stuck between her pole and her owner's bed after trying to jump on both at the same time. As of August 16th, 2016, the tweet has over 141,000 retweets and 161,000 likes. It's believed that the catchphrase was inspired by a dialogue from the Japanese visual novel Shuffle!, first released on January 30th, 2004, in which the character Mayumi Thyme proclaims that "a flat chest is a status symbol" in reference to her own bust.[1] The dialogue was later mentioned in the fourth episode of the 2007 anime series Lucky Star by the main character Konata Izumi, spreading the quote through the anime community (shown below, left). In June 2011, the tenth episode of the anime series Steins;Gate was released, which included a scene wherein the character Mayuri Shiina tries to cheer up Luka Urushibara over her flat chest, translated as "flat is justice" in one of the fansubs (shown below, right).  On July 29th, 2016, Redditor RIPrince submitted an article titled "Trump Suggests Nothing Will Prompt Him to Release Tax Returns" to the /r/politics[2] subreddit. In the comments section, another Redditor speculated that Trump was keeping his tax return private to prevent the discovery that he donated to NAMBLA (shown below). The comment has since been deleted. "But why doesn’t Trump want to release his [tax returns]? Could it be because he donated a sizable amount of money to NAMBLA and he wants to cover it up? I’m not saying Trump donated money to NAMBLA, but people are saying that. It’s something I’ve heard, but I don’t believe Donald Trump donated several million dollars to NAMBLA over the last several years. Still, if he did that would be a great reason to not release his tax returns. But look, I’m not here to say whether or not Donald Trump donated millions to NAMBLA, I’m just here to let you know that every candidate has released his tax returns over the last 40 years, so there has to be a reason he doesn’t, and several very smart people are saying he contributed millions of dollars to NAMBLA."

Rothbard compared government tax collectors to thieves demanding to know what valuables one may have in one's house. "Just as no one is morally required to answer a robber truthfully when he asks if there are any valuables in one's house, so no one can be morally required to answer truthfully similar questions asked by the State, e.g., when filling out income tax returns."

In one particularly memorable scene from the episode, Frank Reynolds (portrayed by Danny Devito) attempts to strike up a conversation with a woman in public by "accidentally" dropping an extra-large condom and boasting about the size of his penis, or in his words, "magnum dong." The quote was spoken during a scene from the Chapter 699 of the manga, released on November 6th, 2014, in which the character Kakashi informs Sasuke that he has been pardoned due to his actions during the Forth Shinobi World War. He mentions that under normal circumstances he would have been imprisoned for life but was forgiven thanks to Naruto to which Sasuke replies "Yeah… sorry".

Tier list rankings are often a point of contention among gamers, many of whom argue that they are inaccurate or that each character's strengths and weaknesses balance each other out. As such, tier lists have been met with negative reception by casual players, while experienced players argue that tiers do exist at the highest level of competitive play and that it would be impossible to perfectly balance a roster consisting of unique characters. Higher level players also state that tier lists do not apply to casual play.

That's so DC. You won't escape the stain. It's like a big, visible "No Ragrets" chest tat that will mark your careers forever. Go public. Man up. Show courage. Say what's in your hearts; he's insane. He's poison. He's doomed. He's killing the Party. None of you are good enough to spin the unspinnable ratfuck that is Trump. None of you can say, "I was just following orders." This weekend, people were lined up hundreds deep to give blood to the victims of Orlando. Your Cheeto Jesus was praising himself. There is no better Trump. There is not Presidential Trump.

This thing happened to me a few months ago; I just need to share it with somebody. It all started at my friend’s party. He’s an artist who rented out a loft in the industrial part of town. If you can picture what a place like Detroit looked like in the 1920s – that’s what this area looks like. A bunch of old turn-of-the-century factories crammed into ten blocks. Most of them are abandoned. So I partied a little too hard that night and decided to crash on a couch at the loft. I woke up at around 4 am, the sun wasn’t out yet but you could still make things out in the dim blue light. I went to the bathroom, carefully tiptoeing around the people that were passed out on the floor. As I was taking a piss I tiptoed to look out the bathroom window and I saw the panorama of deserted urban decay. I remembered how much I liked places like this. It was so dark and devoid of life, and strangely serene. So I went back to the couch and tried to fall asleep. After 45 minutes of staring at the ceiling I decided I didn’t want to be there any longer, so I swallowed my pride and decided to wake my girlfriend up to beg her for a ride, since walking around the vacant streets at this time was not an option. Being an awesome girlfriend, she was totally cool with it, and told me she would be there in about a half-hour and that she would give me a call when she was outside. My phone died ten minutes later so I decide I would sit by the window and watch for her car. I sat there for a while and my eyes started getting heavy and I began to doze off. A crashing noise outside woke me up. It wasn’t loud, but just enough to snap me into reality. I looked out the window and scanned the area, but didn’t see anything. Across the street from the loft near a mountain of garbage bags and one of those enormous dumpsters I see a computer and a monitor smashed against the floor that hadn’t been there before. When my girlfriend arrived I went downstairs and greeted her. Just as I was about to get in the car, I remembered a friend of mine who had blown out his power supply. So I decided to walk over to the dumpster and see what I could salvage. The monitor was worthless, but the tower seemed to have suffered almost no damage, so I put it in the trunk and we drove off. About a week had passed and I had completely forgotten about the tower until my girlfriend called to let me know that it was still in the trunk and that she wanted it out. That night I brought it home. Before I took it apart I decided to hook it up to my monitor to see if it still ran, and to my surprise it did. It ran Windows XP and it looked like it had been wiped clean. I decided to do searches for words like “tits” and “pussy” in hopes of finding some secret stash full of weird deviant porn the previous owner had forgotten about. Morbid curiosity, I guess. Search came up nothing. Searched for picture Files – nothing. Then I searched for movies and one file came up. It was an .avi inside a folder titled “barbie” hidden in the WINDOWS/system32 directory. So I played it, now this is where it gets disturbing. The movie was about an hour long, and was made up of what seemed like raw exported footage. The footage was of this woman sitting on a chair and talking against a white backdrop. I skipped through most of movie and it was all the same continuous shot. Then I decided to sit though the footage to find out what she was talking about. Fifteen seconds into the footage the audio goes completely bad and her voice is drowned in harsh static/background noise. I couldn’t make out a thing. So I imported the footage into final cut and tried to mess with the levels to isolate her voice. It helped a little, but I still couldn’t hear what she was saying. I was intrigued now, and I began to really pay attention to her face and body language. It seems that she's being asked some kind of questions, because she stops at times to listen, and then continues talking. About 15 minutes into the footage, her face begins to redden and contort as if the questions are bothering her… But she continues to answer them anyway. Shortly after she begins to cry. She sobs hysterically for the duration of the film. One of the few words I could lip-read was “skin”. She repeats this word many times throughout the footage and at one point she even pulls at the skin from her arm and mouths the word. She seems to be unhappy with her skin. There is much more I have to get off my chest, but it is getting late and I can't go on. I will share the rest tomorrow. God save my soul. It kept on building and building, and about 40 minutes in she's crying so hard she can barely look at the camera. She stops talking at this point and the rest of the footage is just her crying with her head down. Oddly enough she doesn’t get up or move, the screen just fades to black. I was fucking dumbfounded. I played the whole thing through many times that night, trying to find inflections and nuances in her movement that would reveal anything else about what was going on. I felt so dissatisfied, I wanted to know more. That’s when I noticed that there was about 10 more minutes left on the timeline after the screen went black, and about 2 minutes in there was more footage. The footage was extremely shaky, almost unwatchable, and depicted a pair of legs walking along train tracks. my guess is that camera was accidentally left on as it was being carried somewhere. The person in this footage walks along the train tracks for about 6 minutes and then turns into the forest and walks over what looked like foliage flattened by a piece of plywood. The person continues on this makeshift plywood road until the movie clip ends. Now my heart started beating with excitement because there were train tracks a few miles away that looked very similar to the one in the video. I had to check this out. I called up my friend Ezra; he's 6’4 250 pounds of mostly muscle. I convinced him to go on a little adventure with me. I’m no pushover myself, but I felt if was to go wandering in the woods looking for god knows what, extra muscle couldn’t hurt. This whole idea of investigating this video had me so excited I couldn’t sleep. The next morning on a sunny Saturday, I took my flashlight, my camera, and my 7 inch ka-bar with a matte black finish and serrated edge and went to pick up Ezra. When I got to his house he wasn’t even awake. When I woke him he pretty much told me to fuck off. I was already packed and I had mentally prepared myself to do this so I decided to go through with it without him. I parked my car at the train station, took my stuff, and hopped onto the tracks. After walking for about two hours, I saw a broken piece of plywood and my knees almost buckled with excitement. I searched the nearby foliage, and there it was: a little plywood trail leading into the forest. I walked slowly along the trail, paying close attention to everything. I would stop occasionally, kneel down, and listen for anything or anyone… but it was so quiet. This was one of the most nerve-racking things I've ever done. I didn't know what to expect at the end of this trail. The dense tree line gave way into a little island of grassy field, and then I saw it, a house being consumed by the forest. From the looks of it no one had lived there for 20, maybe 30 years. I got my camera and snapped a few pics. A few yards away from the house was a tool shed made of rusty sheet metal. I just sat there among the trees for a while, absorbing everything. I didn’t want to go into the open field, I had this bad feeling that something would see me. It took me a while to muster the courage to up to the house. The door was partly opened. I pushed it in with the flashlight and was relieved that the inside was actually very well-lit. I put my flashlight away, got my camera and took a few more pics. There was no furniture. The floor was riddled with bricks and wood and rubble, and some of the walls had huge holes in them. When I went in further to explore, I saw some things that I didn’t pay much mind to in that moment, but now that I think about them in hindsight, they greatly disturb me. The first thing that seemed a little odd was that one of the doors in the first room, that I presumed led to the basement, seemed a little too new to be in this house. It was also the only door in the house that was locked. Also, when I made my way up to the second floor, I saw some chairs and a fold-up table that also seemed a little too new to be there. But what disturbed me the most for some reason, was the bathroom. The dust on the mirror had been wiped away, and in the bathtub, I saw a clear plastic tarp that still had water droplets on it from, when I presume, it was washed clean. That’s when I heard something moan really loud, and that’s when I jumped the fuck out of the second story window and ran back to the tracks. Halfway there I realized the moaning was most likely a water pipe expanding or contracting, and that little moment of relief gave into the horror which I felt when I wondered why the water would be running on an abandoned house in the middle of the fucking woods. It's been a little more than 2 months since this happened and I haven’t gone back there, nor do I plan to.   On October 12th, 2001, Nickelodeon aided the SpongeBob episode "Squid On Strike" in the United States.[1] In the episode, SpongeBob protests against his employer Mr. Krabs and Krabs' business the Krusty Krab (clip below). He says "Krusty Krab is unfair. Mr. Krabs is in there, standing at the concession plotting his oppression!"

Within nine years, the video gathered upwards of 6.5 million views and 11,700 comments. The photograph is said to have been circulating the Russian web for several years, typically resurging during the days leading up to and after Victory Day on May 9th, before it gained international fame through the grapevines of social media. According to BBC Trending's investigation, the image was originally taken by photographer Aleksandr Petrosyan[1] on Nevsky Prospekt during the 2007 Victory Day parade in St. Petersburg, Russia. While Petrosyan recalls having taken the photograph of the crying veteran on that day, he stated that he did not speak to him person and the identity of the man remains unknown.

Within the first 72 hours of upload, the video on VICE News YouTube channel garnered over 2.2 million views. The dramatic footage, which was captured on a headcam worn by one of the jihadist fighters who ultimately died during the firefight, begins with a band of ISIS fighters loading into several modified armored vehicles to stage an ambush assault against Kurdish troops, though their maneuver is quickly suppressed by enemy rocket fires. As the Kurdish troops continue to put pressure on the group of visibly inexperienced and disoriented jihadists, an argument breaks out as they struggle to use an arsenal of weapons inside the truck, especially one militant who goes by the name "Abu Hajaar." After repeated failed attempts at returning fire, the fighters begin to retreat from the battlefield, during which the cameraman is fatally shot.  In July 2014, FunnyJunk[4] user tehbestever posted a photoshopped image identifying a young boy named "Dat Boi" as the "most wanted criminal arrested" as "dat boi" In June 2015, Tumblr user phalania submitted a post with the message "here come dat boi!!", followed by a picture of the video game character Pac-Man with the caption "o shit waddup!" (shown below).[3] Although the original post was removed, reblogs managed to accumulate over 75,800 notes in the next year. On April 3rd, 2016, the Facebook page Fresh Memes About the Mojave Desert and Other Delectable Cuisines posted an image of a green frog riding a unicycle with the caption "here come dat boi!!!!!! / o shit waddup!" (shown below).[8] The frog graphic originates from the Animation Factory Essential Collection 3.[7]   On April 25th, 2016, student protesters began loudly shouting at speakers during "The Triggering" event held at UMass Amherst, with many accusing the hosts of "hate speech."

The Pepsi logo used for the "Isded" illusion debuted in 1960, placing a sans serif font version of the Pepsi logo before a blue and red bottle cap (now known as the globe).[1] It is unknown when the first instance of this meme was posted online, but it was likely coined in reference to the massive-scale marketing campaign for the 2015 American 3D animated family comedy film Minions that took place during the summer of 2015. The earliest known mention of the phrase can be found in an image post submitted by Imgur user Valdros on July 1st, 2015. In the post[1], the phrase accompanies an image of a Minion discussing different breast sizes. Trump faced criticism from conservatives and the Republican Party establishment soon after he entered the race in 2015. Early opposition to Trump frequently cited his stances on trade,[29] abortion,[30] tax increases,[30] and government-provided healthcare[31] as significant departures from the fiscal and social conservatism of the Republican Party. As the Republican presidential primary developed, the Republican field crowded to at least twelve notable candidates as of Iowa Caucuses[7], though at times it had at least seventeen candidates.[32] Analysts have suggested that the large field divided traditional Republican voters in early primary contests, allowing Trump to achieve victory even when polls indicated Republicans' preference for one of the other candidates.[8] Though Trump had already received substantial criticism from many Republicans prior to 2016,[22] some Republican commentators and strategists suggested that the field narrow and that Republican voters consolidate around a single, non-Trump candidate to combat Trump's initial victories. Early advocates of this strategy include the editorial board of the National Review, a conservative political magazine, which made it the magazine's editorial policy to oppose Trump's candidacy.[9] On February 26th, 2016, the hashtag #NeverTrump began trending worldwide on Twitter, [1] primarily in response to Donald Trump's victory in the Nevada primaries and an endorsement from New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. According to BuzzFeed,[1] a Tumblr user posted the original set of images in February 2016, featuring pictures of six different women with three identifying characteristics each (shown below). The original post has since been deleted. On December 6th, 2015, Tumblr user zakk.lol[3] posted the original image as a joke reply to a Smash the Like request from user browningtons. In the original image, the button said "LIKE." The post, shown below, has gained 129,729 notes as of January 12th, 2016. The comic was first drawn and published by Tumblr user 'patientno7[1]' on 23rd April, 2016, using Succ as the punchline. The comic, shown below, has accumulated 172,000 notes as of February 2017. On April 14th, 2011, the satirical YouTube channel PronunciationManual posted a video titled "How to Pronounce Penis," in which a voice pronounces the word incorrectly as "bepis" (shown below). Within five years, the video gained over 2.9 million views and 2,000 comments. The coinage of the term, as it is used in the context of video gaming, can be traced back to the players of the 1991 arcade fighting game Street Fighter; the earliest known online mention of "cheesing" can be found in a list of frequently asked questions (FAQs) for Street Fighter II that was posted via Usenet's newsgroup alt.games.sf2 as early as on August 25th, 1993. On April 24th, 2016, Drake announced via Twitter that the cover of his fourth studio album, Views from the 6 would feature a photograph of him sitting on the edge of the top of Toronto's famous CN Tower. The tweet received over 131,000 retweets and 150,000 likes in 24 hours.[1] On March 17th, 2016, the British scientific research agency NERC launched an online crowdsourced contest to name its newly commissioned 129-meter long polar research vessel--the largest and most advanced British royal research vessel to date. Shortly after the launch of the Internet poll, the website was promptly raided by pranksters suggesting a variety of goofy names, most notably RRS Boaty McBoatface as suggested by former BBC presenter James Hand.  On April 22nd, 2016, Birdman, the co-founder of Cash Money Records and one half of the hip hop duo Big Tymers, made a guest appearance on New York City's syndicated urban contemporary radio show The Breakfast Club. During the live interview, Birdman went on a verbal tirade against the show's hosts, DJ Envy, Angela Yee and Charlamagne, angrily demanding them to "stop playing with [his] fucking name" and "put some respect on [his] name", proceeding to leave the building. (shown below). While Birdman refused to participate in the interview or elaborate on the nature of his complaints, the co-hosts speculated that his on-air meltdown may have been a reaction to several jokes made by Rick Ross and Trick Daddy at the expense of his name during an interview on their show in 2015, as well as their roasting of the hip hop mogul for failing to pay a number of artists on his record label, including Lil Wayne. The exact origin of the ads are currently unknown. The first pop-up ads were created using a web interface developed by internet activist Ethan Zuckerman while he was employed at the web-hosting company, Tripod, in the mid 1990s.[2] On December 17th, 2008, the internet scams blog Fraudo[1] published an article titled "Congratulations You Won," which lamented a type of intrusive pop-up ad that would send viewers to the Freelotto scam website (shown below). On April 17th, 2016, a thread was created on 4chan's /co/ board, [2] with a picture of a character heavily resembling Lapis Lazuli. After a few replies, a user provided a link to episode 20 of Fantaman, featuring the character to the surprise of most posters in the thread. Similarly, a post on Tumblr was made by user Sour stuff[3] alluding to the similarities (including water powers), the post gained 6,649 notes after 5 days. The scene was originally featured in the 11th episode of Cartoon Network's Powerpuff Girls titled Tiara Trouble[1], which aired on April 15th, 2016. In the episode, Bubbles gets groomed by her sisters Blossom and Buttercup for Townsville's beauty pageant, but amidst the growing pressures from her sisters to win the contest, Bubbles refuses to go along with their plan and yells "no me gusta!" with a look that resembles the "NO" face, both of which are well-known instances of the rage comic memeplex. That same day, YouTuber DiscordDiscord uploaded a clip of the scene, garnering over 150,000 views and more than 4,100 dislikes (as of April 26th, 2016). Following the airing of the episode, the scene quickly prompted backlash from some fans who apparently misinterpreted Bubbles' face as an anti-semitic caricature due to its depiction of a prominent nose, as well as some meme elitists who criticized the production team's appropriation of Internet meme culture and the incongruous pairing of the phrase "no me gusta" and Bubble's "NO" facial expression, which are considered two distinct memes within the rage comic universe (show below, right). On January 6th, 2015, Washington Free Beacon[1] released a supercut-style video montage highlighting 31 on-screen instances that American political commentator Chris Matthews has compared Ted Cruz to the Cold War-era U.S. senator Joe McCarthy.  In September, the first Fallout game was released for PC systems, which featured the line "War never changes" in a voice-over narration by actor Ron Perlman heard immediately after the game's opening cinematic.[1] On September 30th, 1998, the sequel Fallout 2 was released, which used the same line during the opening sequence. Ten years later in October 2008, the quote was featured in the introduction of the game Fallout 3. In the episode "Can You Share A Dime?"

In January 1987, the manga series JoJo's Bizarre Adventure debuted in Japan.[1] The manga focused heavily on sound effects and featured the phrase in panels to help create a more immersive experience. This technique appeared in the manga's first issue, in which the artists depict sound through expressive typography within the illustration (shown below, left). Variations of the "ゴゴゴゴ" begin appearing as early as issue three, released on January 13th, 1987 (shown below, right). In August 2015, Twitter user @Xx__Eric_xX[4] uploaded a video featuring a photograph of a man followed by several images of frogs and fictional characters while a man mocks his appearance in the background. The video was subsequently removed, but was mirrored on YouTube several days later (shown below). The term Pop-Tart Challenge has been used to refer to several different types of videos, including competitive eating. The first Pop-Tart Challenge in which a taste-test was employed was uploaded on July 18th, 2015 by the account Collintv, where it received over 1.5 million views as of April 19th, 2016.  Starting in November 2015, a series of videos commissioned by Australia's New South Wales Department of Premier and Cabinet were released on Facebook,[1] which feature people dressed in a sloth costumes who demonstrate ineptitude in various social situations as a result of being too high on marijuana. The origin of this meme is unknown, but it first surfaced around October 2015 on Facebook around the same time as the hashtag-based challenge #BeCarefulWhoYouCallUglyChallenge began circulating.

The review was a simple one, showing the viewer's expectation to be a simple magical girl series akin to Cardcaptor Sakura, albeit with ballet. However, what the viewer actually got was something beyond magical, beyond ballet… it was… AWESOME. The only way to sum up how awesome this series was in one image was to use the mighty guitar ninjas. Such exaggerated comparison of Princess Tutu and ninjas with guitars spawned another inside joke Guitar Ninjas, which is well-known for being the definition of awesome. On April 18th, 2016, Trump was giving a speech in Buffalo, New York. During the speech, he spoke about the effect the September 11th Terrorist Attacks had on him.[1] Trump's spokeswoman, Katrina Pierson, later called the gaffe a slip of the tongue.[2] On February 7th, 2015, a Twitch user began demanding a person named Joel get on Skype in the Twitch chat room for the North American LCS, leading other users to spam the message in the channel.[1] On April 12th, 2016, Kid Rock posted an image of himself smiling and sticking up his middle finger while standing outside of a courtroom, prefaced with the caption that reads "hey, authority."

Bankai was originally made by Japanese Author Tito Kubo, creator of the famous manga Bleach[1] The origin of the phrase is not known, but usage of the term is reported to be found around 2004. The earliest popularly-known example of 'randomness' on the Internet is the meme Katy t3h PeNgU1N oF d00m. Another speculated source of the rise of popularity of the phrases might be due to the Disney Channel show titled "So Random!"[3]. On April 13th, 2016, the online tabloid The Sun[1] published a Splash News photograph of Buble eating the end of a corn on the cob while at the Disneyland theme park in Anaheim, California (shown below).

While troll science is rumored to have started on 4chan, the earliest known example was submitted to the f7u12[1] rage comic subreddit in a post titled "Troll Physics" on September 13th, 2010. The comic featured a drawing of a self-propelled truck powered by two horseshoe magnets facing each other, which would be theoretically impossible based on their placement. The post received only 44 up votes and 4 comments prior to being archived. The earliest known instance of the copypasta appeared on October 12th, 2006 in the /a/ (anime) discussion board of 4chan[2] in a thread discussing reasons why the anime series Naruto “sucks.” In the thread, the poster identified herself as a “random” 13-year-old girl named Katy and demanded to be referred to as “t3h PeNgU1N oF d00m.” On April 14th, 2016, Twitter user @sn15papa[1] submitted a photograph of a baby's arms held next to a stick of bread with the hashtag "#我が子の最強ちぎりパン画像"[11] (#MyBaby'sGotTheBestBreadPhoto in English) (shown below).

In this experiment, a trolley theoretically approaches five people tied down to a set of tracks. Using a lever, the trolley can be diverted to a different set of tracks, where only one person is tied down; a person could either allow the trolley to kill five people or divert it to kill one. The Trolley Problem is frequently discussed in military circles to metaphorically address issues of population targeting. The exploitable comic was originally drawn and posted by philosophy professor Jesse Prinz on his site subcortex.com[1] sometime before 2009. The image was posted along with a depiction of connected moral dilemma called the Fat Man Problem. The origin of the phrase is unknown, but some sources point to it first being used as a sincere programmer's shorthand. The first definition in Urban Dictionary, recorded on April 15th, 2005, simply defines the acronym as "Fixed that for you," with a non-sarcastic example:[1] Other early definitions, like that on the computing forum Computer Hope, are also sincere.[2] One of the earliest known mentions of the slash pairing can be found in a fan speculation thread about a possible romantic relationship between Finn and Rey, the protagonist of the film, submitted to /r/StarWars[26] by Redditor Asajj66 on September 17th, 2015. In response to the question from the original poster (OP), Redditor MagicWalrusO_o replied: Throughout September and October 2015, more speculations about a potentially bromantic relationship between Finn and Poe Dameron began to circulate on Star Wars fan forums and communities. On October 10th, StarWarsNewsNet forum member Darth Quindow[25] raised the possibility of romance between Finn and Poe in a thread titled "The Official Finn Discussion." Following the release of the last official trailer for The Force Awakens on October 20th, the fans' speculation surrounding Finn and Poe's bromance rapidly snowballed into a popular subject of shipping across various fanfiction and fan art communities, most notably on Tumblr, DeviantART and Fanfiction.net. W.I.P. In 2012 film Batman: The Dark Knight Rises, after a foot chase, commissioner James Gordon (played by Gary Oldman) becames trapped down the sewers of Gotham City because of an explosion, leading to a scene where police officer John Blake (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) pleads for his colleagues to go and help Gordon, to which commissioner Peter Foley (played by Matthew Modine) promptly retorts "Someone get this hothead outta here". The scene was uploaded to YouTube on May 2nd 2014 (shown below). As early as October 1st 2012, a 4chan user on the /m/ (mecha) board used the phrase "Would somebody get this hot head out of here!" as a reply to another user[1]. Then, on November 21st, 2012, another user reused "SOMEBODY GET THAT HOTHEAD OUTTA HERE" as a response towards a user who tried to debunk the misinterpreted dialogue behind the Baneposting meme[2], in a /tv/ (television & films) thread itself referencing the Bravo Nolan meme. The first known Fire Spray Challenge video was uploaded on March 18th, 2016 by Instagram user freshtoatea, who received 4,352 likes as of April 13th.

He then reveals he plans to crash the plane, which he does with the help of his associates, before escaping himself. On December 11th, 2011, an audio file of the leaked scene was posted to 4chan's /tv/ (Television & Film) board,[1] featuring the following dialogue between Bane and the CIA agent (shown below). Soon, commenters in the thread began scrutinizing the last two lines in the dialogue, as some misinterpreted Bane's interspersed quote "[it would be extremely painful] …for you" as a double-entendre with suggestive connotations, i.e., "[I'm a big guy] …for you." In 2003, Nick.com debuted the Flash game "SpongeBob Kah Rah Tay Contest." In the game, SpongeBob SquarePants and Sandy the Squirrel spar in a karate match.

On April 7th, 2016, the HALO Memes Facebook page shared their own version of the meme which gained over 800 likes and 150 shares. The image featured a HALO character riding in a military style vehicle coupled with the text message. HALO Memes later commented on the post, citing inspiration from Facebook user Ludwig Savant who posted on the Death Grips Shisposting Facebook group. Another early instance was first appeared on April 8th, 2016, on Tumblr, where the image of the text message was paired with Natsu Dragion of the anime and manga series Fairy Tail.

The story of Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens, the seventh installment in the Star Wars saga and the first film in its sequel trilogy, concludes with the film's protagonist Rey (portrayed by Daisy Ridley) and Luke Skywalker (portrayed by Mark Hamill) meeting face-to-face for the first time since the latter's self-imposed exile, during which Rey presents Luke with his long lost lightsaber and implicitly volunteers to be his Jedi apprentice. Shortly after the premiere of the film in December 2015, fans were quick to speculate on various online forums[1][2] that Rey would become a Jedi, while joking that Luke Skywalker would ask Rey to carry him on her back, as Yoda did with his Jedi apprentice Luke in Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back. On December 19th, 2015, the earliest known fan depiction of such scene was posted by Redditor Diregal in a /r/StarWars[3] thread titled "Imagine if the ending went…" do not plagiarise infos from other websites In July 2005, the term "sexting" was coined in an article titled "The one and only" in the Australian Sunday Telegraph Magazine, where it was used in the context of sexually explicit text messages sent during an extramarital affair.[1] In 2004, the trans-Neptunian object 90377 Sedna was discovered with a noticeably peculiar orbit, suggesting it interacted with some other large object to deviate away from the Kuiper belt. In 2008, other trans-Neptunian objects were discovered with odd orbiting patterns. In 2014, the science journal Nature published a paper by astronomers Chad Trujillo and Scott S. Sheppard, which proposed the existence of a large planet to explain the orbit patterns of the objects Sedna and 2012 VP113.[1] On January 20th, 2016, Caltech professors Konstantin Batygin and Mike Brown (the same professor responsible for demoting Pluto from planet to dwarf planet) made a statement announcing the possibility of a ninth planet in the solar system.[8] On Wednesday, April 6th, Bernie Sanders stated in a speech that he believed that Hillary Clinton was unqualified to hold the office of president based on her previous decisions in fundraising, the Iraq War, and other judgements.

A week after the incidents, several news websites published that some suspects carried a note with several phrases in German translated into Arab, including phrases like "I want to kiss you" and "big breasts", and the word "fucken", a mispelling of "ficken", to fuck.[1][2] On January 22nd, German police released the facial composite of a sexual assaulter from the district of Waldhof, in the city of Mannheim, who assaulted a 55 years old woman during the New Year's Eve.[9] Both the composite and the note phrases were heavily mocked on sme online communities, like 4chan's international board /int/,[3] being a post from January 30th the first one to associate both.[4] On April 28th, 2015, Nileseyy Niles posted the first of three successive Vine[1] videos in which he is in a confusing or aggressive situation. In each video, he holds up a peace sign and uses a special effect to disappear. The first video in the series received 1.8 million loops, the second almost 1 million loops, and the third 1.9 million loops as of April 2016.  On June 15th, 1987, Chapter 25 of the manga was released. During the events of Part 1: Phantom Blood[1], the protagonists, Jonathan Joestar, William A. Zeppeli, and Robert Edward O. Speedwagon are ambushed by Dio Brando and his zombie subjects. Zeppeli is the first one to engage Dio, and the two have the following exchange: Dio Brando: When I heal these wounds on my stomach, I will have erased all of JoJo's burns! Come! Magician! I will fumigate these wounds wilth your life! William A. Zeppeli: Bastard… How many lives have you sucked to heal those wounds!? Dio Brando: Do you remember how many breads have you eaten in your life? It is unknown where the quote originally gained traction online, but the earliest archived examples can be traced back to February 15th, 2008 in a thread on 4chan's /a/ (anime & manga) board about the character Remilia Scarlet from the Touhou series[3], who is notable for quoting Brando's phrase in the game Embodiment of Scarlet Devil[4]. On March 29th, 2016, EgyptAir Flight 18 was hijacked by a passenger claiming to be wearing an explosive belt while en route from Borg El Arab Airport in Alexandria to Cairo International Airport in Egypt. Shortly after taking control of the plane, the hijacker forced the pilot to divert and land the plane at Larnaca International Airport in Cyprus, where he held four crew members and three European passengers hostage for several hours and demanded to see his estranged wife living in the country. By 2:41 p.m. local time, the crisis had ended with the release of the remaining hostages (shown below, left) and the arrest of the hijacker, who was identified as 58-year-old Egyptian national Seif Eldin Mustafa. Later that same day, a photograph of an unknown male passenger smiling and posing with Mustafa began circulating on Twitter (shown below, right). The original video of the dog was taken in an army encampment in Kazakstan and posted November 14th, 2013. The staff at the encampment are playing the song "You're My Heart, You're My Soul" by Modern Talking, a popular European group from the 1980s. The original video has acquired more than 3.4 million views as of April 6th, 2016.[1] Chloe Woodard posted the original Vine on July 2nd, 2015, and as of April 5th, 2016, it has acquired more than 90.5 million loops, 626,000 likes, and over 331,000 revines. In the clip, Woodard is wearing a tie-dye shirt and a large ponytail, and shimmying her shoulders to the beat of A-ha's "Take On Me." After a few moments, she turns dramatically, and you can see that she has a full set of braces, several pimples, and sunglasses that are too small. In a Paper Magazine interview from September 2015, Woodard wrote about what caused her to film the original clip: We were playing outside and messing around with the water balloons outside. My friend gave me the glasses and I was just playing around with them. I was like, "Wait this would be funny" and I had her film it for me. I was like, "Did you like this?" and she was like, "Yeah, well maybe you could put music to it." And I always put "Take on Me" by a-ha to my Vines. So I was like, "Alright I guess we'll put that one." And I don't know, I guess everyone liked it! While the exact origin of the comic is unknown, it may have originated from 4chan due to the use of the name "Anon-kun," a reference to the site's anonymous users. On January 11th, 2014, the comic was submitted to an Oculus Rift thread on the RPG Codex Forums[6] (shown below).  The hyphenated term “slut-shaming” began appearing in feminist blogging circles as early as on November 14th, 2006 in an article about a fight between two female bloggers written by Alon Levy at Abstract Nonsense.[6] After Skatje found out her former long-distance boyfriend was having cybersex with other women while they were dating, she posted a lengthy response about how terrible sex is without intimacy or love. When Katie rebutted that you do not need to love someone to have good sex with them, Skatje asked “And if I may be blunt, isn’t your lifestyle a perfect definition of the word ‘slut’?.” In response, Katie posted about the problematic nature of women calling other women sluts in a now-deleted blog post. Levy concluded the following: Dio Brando first appeared in the first chapter of the original manga series, during the events of Part 1: Phantom Blood. In the opening chapter, Dio gets adopted by the Joestar family, a powerful clan comprised of the main protagonists in the series, following the death of his biological father Dario Brando[1]. In the following chapters, Dio spends his years tormenting his adoptive brother Jonathan Joestar by placing him in alienation from his father and friends, stealing a kiss from his girlfriend and getting his dog burned alive. As the story progresses, Dio turns into a cruel and ruthless villain as a vampire with the help of an ancient stone mask, though his reign of terror gets ultimately stopped by Jonathan and his allies. After a noticeable period of absence in Part II: Battle Tendency, Dio Brando makes his return in Part III: Stardust Crusaders as "DIO," fully resurrected as the archenemy of the Joestar family with the power to stop time using his supernatural power (otherwise known as The Stand) of The World.   On April 1st, 2016, The JustGreat Minty Meeo realized that April fools day had snuck up on him, leaving him with no joke entries to submit to Know Your Meme. Then, he remembered the ironic meme called long boy. With his shoddy Photoshop skills, he quickly made a color inversion of long boy, and titled it "short girl" Shortly after, he remarked this quote. Within a few hours, the entry got deadpooled, so The JustGreat Minty Meeo decided he'd acually try to make a good entry.  While telling someone to "delete" a post is not new, the specific spelling seems to result from a video of a Gary's Mod game where a player was "buried alive" by another player. Knowing that the player burying him is recording the game, the buried player shouts "Delete this!" repeatedly in the recording. The video was originally posted at a longer length and then removed; the version below was posted on January 4th, 2014, and has received over 264,000 views since. In 2006, the free magazine Memewar[5] was created as a multidisciplinary magazine including work from various genres, including poetry, prose, art, photography, essays and comics. The name was based on a combination of "memoir," a recording of history, and "meme war," as a clash of ideas. The original image is taken from the music video of Drake's 2015 hit R&B single "Hotline Bling", in which the hip hop artist performs several different dance moves and gestures, including one that shows him holding his hand up to the side of his face while looking disgusted (shown below). The pose in question was subsequently isolated into a reaction image and began circulating on 4chan's /v/ (video games) board as early as mid-to-late 2015 (shown below), with its earliest known usage as a reaction image found in a /v/ (video game) thread[1] about first-person shooter games posted on October 31st earlier that year. Meanwhile, the earliest use of the term "Drakeposting" to describe general discussions about the hip hop artist on 4chan dates back to a comment posted in a /fit/ (fitness) thread[2] on May 4th, 2015. "Hotline Bling" was released as a single on July 31st, 2015.[1] On October 4th, Drake announced via Instagram that a music video for the song would be released.[2] The video was released onto Apple's, Apple Music on October 19th.[3] However, many other users released the music video onto YouTube.  It's believed that the first image was posted in Krautchan's international board in late 2010, comparing Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (shown below). However, the earliest known use of a flag bearer image online comes from the Warosu traditional games board, or /tg/, on September 25th, 2013. The image had a lineup of 10 flag bearers, all referencing characters from The Elder Scrolls game universe. The image was then subsequently posted seven more times within Warosu. Netora as a Japanese term for cuckoldry literally translates to "taken away by sleeping with." In typical NTR stories, the heroine will be introduced as having a close relationship with- or love interest for the male protagonist. The story will then show the aforementioned heroine being intimate with another man. The nature of these affairs vary per story, as will the outcome; in certain cases also involving "Mind Break", another infamous hentai genre in which a heroine is mentally scarred through intercourse.   In July 2012, Gardner created the @Bill_Nye_tho[12] Twitter feed, which gathered upwards of 131,000 followers over the next four years. On March 26th, 2016, Bernie Sanders won the Democratic Caucuses in Washington, Hawaii, and Alaska. In his article on the victories, CNN's Chris Moody wrote:[1] These caucus states -- largely white and rural -- are the type of places Sanders traditionally does well. In order to win the nomination, he must replicate this success in other, more ethnically diverse states that hold primaries, as he did in Michigan last month. Many online took offense at the statement, especially residents of Hawaii, where the white non-hispanic population is just 26.7% according to the United States Census.[2] In one Twitter exchange about the remarks the following day, Twitter user tokyobrainstorming (Real name: Leslie Lee III),[3] wrote that ever since he had voted for Sanders, he had become so white that he was "bingewatching Friends."[4] He also used the hashtag #BernieMadeMeWhite; the tweet was retweeted 668 times and favorited over 1,900 times. On July 17th, 2015, "Run Away with Me" was released as the second single off Jepsen's album Emotion. The same day, the CarlyRaeJepsen VEVO YouTube channel uploaded the official music video for the track, which gathered upwards of 17.8 million views and 7,500 comments in the next eight months (shown below). The original image (pictured below) was made by a /jp/ drawfag, as part of the Chalkno[2] image set. It depicts Cirno making a shrugging motion and proclaiming "It's either me or Touhou 13". The earliest known archived posts containing the image possibly date back to May 10th, 2011, to threads on 4chan's /jp/ board[1]. By definition, lolicon is a portmanteau of the phrase "Lolita complex," which describes an attraction to young or prepubescent girls.[7] However, amongst anime fans, the term loli has come to describe characters with solely the physiques of a prepubescent girl due to the frequently similar physiques of females from varying age groups in anime and manga.[8] This has lead to fans of the loli genre to add adjectives to the term, in order to seperate loli-like characters of different age groups (shown below). On March 25th, 2016, Democratic primary presidential candidate Bernie Sanders made an appearance at a campaign rally held at the Moda Center in Portland, Oregon. During his speech, a brown house finch flew onto the stage, which immediately prompted cheers and laughters from the crowd (shown below). As Sanders, who seemed just as entertained by the unexpected intruder, tried to resume his speech, the bird approached the Vermont senator even closer by perching on his podium, triggering further excitement and bewilderment from his supporters in attendance, as well as many others online who witnessed the strange interruption via livecast.[1] On November 20th, 2000, the new age song "Only Time" by Enya was released along with the artist's fifth studio album A Day Without Rain. The song subsequently became Enya's most successful solo single in the United States, hitting the #10 position on the Billboard Hot 100 list that month.[7] Nearly two months after September 11th, 2001, Enya performed the song on the CNN talk show Larry King Live to commemorate victims of the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon,[10] which subsequently gave rise to its popular usage as background music in 9/11 tribute videos on YouTube. On July 16th, 2004, YTMND user CaptainPancakes submitted a page titled Never forget 5/3, featuring an image of a cliff face accompanied by the song "Only Time" playing in the background. Over the next several years, the song continued to be used on the site in pages referencing death or demise.[8] According to an anonymous 4chan user,[3] the proofster illustrations originated on Krautchan around the same time as the War in Donbass in March 2014, and were used to mock nationalist Russians would continue to demand "proof" of Russian involvement in Eastern Ukraine, regardless of the evidence presented in an argument. The scene originates from the "Hell's Cafeteria" parody skit from episode 50 of The Late Late Show with James Cordon, which first aired April 26th, 2015. In the skit Gordon Ramsey holds Julie Chen's head between two slices of bread, then proceeds to ask her "What are you?" She then replies "An idiot sandwich." The scene was uploaded to YouTube the morning after it aired, where it has garnered more than 2 million views as of March 29th, 2016. The phrase was first used in the Family Guy episode, "Meet the Quagmires", which was aired on May 20th, 2007. In it, a scene is shown where Tom Cruise says that phrase while trying to run away from gay thoughts, personified as himself in a thought bubble.  In the episode "Dipper and Mabel vs. The Future", Dipper and Ford are investigating an alien spacecraft. While inside, Dipper takes a selfie with a wall of alien markings.(Video Below) On March 23rd, 2016, TMZ[1] published a video titled "Katt Williams Sucker Punches Kid But Gets Ass Beating," featuring a short video clip of Williams punching a young man before being taken to the ground and being placed in a rear naked choke. While on the ground, Williams can be heard yelling "tap," a term used in grappling and mixed martial arts to indicate a fight has been forfeit. On April 18th, 2000, Exodia first appeared in the premiere episode of Yu-Gi-Oh. The Exodia card set was later released as the first alternative win condition in the Yu-Gi-Oh trading card game.[6] On March 24th 2016, Yahoo! News published an article as well as a video interview with the cast and crew of the newly-released 2016 DC Comics blockbuster film Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice, including director Zack Snyder and the lead actors Ben Affleck and Henry Cavill.[1] In the segment with Affleck and Cavill, the interviewer asked them how they feel about the mixed to negative reviews from critics the film has received so far. Cavill then took the lead in answering the question while Affleck remained in silence with a noticeably sad look on his face (shown below) That same day, YouTuber Sabconth created a parody of the interview clip featuring a collage of headlines from review articles, indicating the negative reception of the movie, set to the intro from Simon and Garfunkel's folk-rock song "The Sound of Silence" (mirror below). The video gained more than a million views within the first 48 hours. The first known use of the image was in a post in a January 28th, 2016 /r9k/ thread about a new meme, "frail snail." The post suggested that the blobfish would be a much better animal for a meme than the snail, because "Blobfish's are litteraly the omega males of the animal kingdom."[2] The first known use of the image accompanied by the word "blobo" is in a February 1st, 2016 /r9k/ post in a thread about a new meme called "morzo." The post stated that "BLOBO IS NEW MAYMAY".[3]  On July 17th, 1999, Spongebob Squarepants Season 1 Episode 2b titled "Ripped Pants" was broadcast, in which a lifeguard named Frank is annoyed to discover that Squarepants faked drowning in order to trick him into saving him. On December 29th, 2009, a screen capture of the character was uploaded by YouTuber FlashingTights titled "Make This the Most Thumbed Down Video in History" (shown below). Over the next seven years, the video received more than 8.1 million views, 19,500 comments and 50,900 dislikes. On October 24th, 2011, an image macro of Frank with the caption "There's no cows in the ocean so that means.. / Krabby Patties must be made of fish" was submitted to /r/funny,[1] where it gained over 740 votes (92% upvoted) and 165 comments prior to being archive (shown below). In the mid to late 1990s, advances in computer networking and digital camera technology made livestreaming video more accessible to the general public. In 1998, one of the earliest known bird cams was installed to view the nest of a violet-green swallow nicknamed "Gracie" (shown below). In 2003, the cam was shutdown.[13] The original tweet, now deleted, was posted by British Twitter user Matthew Doyle, a 46-year-old London-based public relations specialist, in response to the coordinated bombings that took place in Brussels, Belgium on March 22nd, 2016. In the tweet, Doyle recounts an anecdotal story in which the author claims to have "confronted" a random Muslim woman in London and demanded an explanation from her for the Brussels bombings. On March 22nd, 2016, the official Facebook page of Matteo Salvini, the leader of the Italian regionalist party Lega Nord (Northern League), uploaded several photographs of the politician posing in front of heavily guarded sites across the city's downtown. Among them were a photograph of Salvini speaking on the phone next to an armed Belgian guard outside of the European Union headquarters, with the caption reading: "Army and bulletproof vests at the entrance of the parliament. City stopped, just sirens, ambulances and helicopters. And someone keeps saying that we haven't declared war. Wake up! Prayer isn't enough anymore. According to numerous Italian news reports, the outspoken leader of the anti-EU regionalist party was about to board a flight back to Italy from Belgium earlier that morning, but after the Brussel bombings prompted a virtual lockdown across the city, he was turned away by the police and instructed to return to his office at the EU headquarters. Within the first 24 hours of the Facebook post, Salvini's photograph garnered over 69,000 likes (including 2,275 angry and 877 sad reactions), 19,000 shares and 4,800 comments. On March 18th, 2016, several Twitter[1][2][3] users began posting screenshots of the iPhone's "call ended" onscreen notification along with joke phone conversation transcripts (shown below).  The earliest known website to curate church signs featuring humorous or irreverent messages can be credited to the Church Sign Generator,[1] which was created by Austin-based web developer Ryland Sanders in 2004. According to the FAQs section on its parent website, Says-It.com,[2] the idea came about when Sanders began photoshopping images of actual church signs he had photographed for fun and shared a few examples on his blog. After readers of his blog responded by submitting their own church sign photos, Sanders decided to launch a webpage devoted to curation of humorous church signs.[3] On March 15th, 2016, the マクドナルド公式（McDonald’s）YouTube channel posted a video titled "Mirai no Watashi" ("The Future Me" in English), featuring the young girl Sumire Hibino who is trained by a senior McDonald's staff member (named Ikumi Hoshino) to be calm and confident in her work at the fast food restaurant. The ad directs viewers to the Japanese McDonald's website for further details on hiring and staff positions. The website showcases five characters (including Sumire and Ikumi), who belong to different age groups, each describing why they started working in McDonald's and their satisfaction with their new job. It has been announced that 4 more commercials will be released for the campaign, presumably starring the remaining four characters from the webpage.[1] On March 20, 2016, the question was posed to Facebook group "God Save Us From Your Opinion: A Place For Serious Discussion of Judaism" along with an image of a Hassidic Jewish wedding, with a bride wearing an opaque veil and holding one end of a rope, while an older, unidentified male (probably a relative or community leader) held the other end of the rope and danced for the bride. (This custom is known as a mitzva tantz.) Many group members felt that the post assumed condescending judgments about more conservative streams of Judaism, and voiced objection. On March 20th, 2016, the "March Madness" round-of-32 qualification match between Xavier Musketeers (Xavier University) and Wisconsin Badgers (University of Wisconsin) in the 2016 NCAA Men's Division I basketball tournament went underway at Scottrade Center in St. Louis, Missouri. Despite the fans' high hopes for the Musketeers' victory against the Badgers, as they had been seeded at second place in the entire division, the game ended in an unexpected victory for the Badgers (66 – 63) with a buzzer-beating, dramatic three-pointer scored by Bronson Koenig. Among the crowd of courtside spectators shocked by the dramatic outcome was American comedian and actor Bill Murray, who has been spotted at a number of the Musketeers' games during the 2015-16 season to support his son and newly appointed assistant coach for the team, Luke. Immediately after the game ended, a TNT camera turned to Murray to capture his reaction (shown below). The word snek derives from This Is Snek, the popularity of which led to an entire subreddit, /r/snek,[6] devoted to images of snakes with and without the additional interior monologue captioning. The earliest known example including interior monologue captioning (below) was posted to the Facebook community "Snek" on October 16th, 2015.[4] It obtained over 100 likes and 20 shares in 5 months.   The reaction image is taken from a black and white comic entitled featuring /mlp/-tan and /v/-tan expressing his desire to fuck a unicorn. The unicorn is based on a design from the comic "Phoebe and Her Unicorn" by Dana Simpson. The first instance of the use of the image within the context was on /v/ on November 23, 2015[1] It is unclear how milk became an urban remedy for dissociative drug overdoses. On November 7th, 2005, Drugs-Forum[5] member ssjoe6 submitted a thread titled "why do people chug milk when high on pcp?", asking why some people believe milk produces a calming effect for those experiencing a bad trip on the dissociative drug phencyclidine. On December 21st, 2008, a similar thread was submitted to the Bluelight Forums,[3] to which several users replied that it was likely an urban legend or placebo effect. On October 9th, 2010, YouTuber LilSik uploaded footage of a young man who appears to be intoxicated sitting on the floor while an onlooker can be heard saying "get him some milk" (shown below, left). On June 9th, 2011, YouTuber ArbysFan919 uploaded a video titled "He high as hell," in which a man groaning while laying on the ground is approached by the cameraman, who comments "get him some f**king milk man" before the man being filmed rolls into the middle of the street (shown below, right). On February 4th, 2015, YouTuber jstudio uploaded a video titled "Give That Boy Some Milk! Mojo Synthetic Drug Trip," in which a woman films a man experiencing a psychotic episode in a parking lot while repeatedly advising others that "he needs some milk" and "get him some milk' (shown below). Within the next 14 months, the video gained over 1.8 million views and 3,400 comments. According to Mashable,[2] women first began posting photographs of themselves holding sheets of A4 paper in front of their waist on the Chinese microblogging and social networking site Weibo in February 2016 (shown below). On March 11th, 2016, The Alex Jones Channel YouTube channel posted a video titled "Anti-Trump Protesters Go Berserk!", featuring a heated argument between Trump supporters and anti-Trump activists taking place outside of a Trump rally in St. Louis, Missouri (shown below).   On March 26th, 2014, EDM group Krewella released a music video for their song "Party Monster" on YouTube, garnering over 8 million views as of March 2016 (below left). Soon after the video's release, users on Vine began creating videos of themselves imitating the spastic, erotically-charged movements from the video (below right). On March 16th, 2016, Twitter user Kelsey Harmon tweeted a photograph of her grandfather eating a hamburger, along with a caption referring to him as "papaw" and expressing sadness that she was the only one of six grandchildren that showed up for his birthday dinner (shown below). In the first 48 hours, the tweet gained over 225,000 likes and 137,000 retweets. "Formation" was released as free downloadable track on Tidal and music video on YouTube simultaneously,[1][2] with no prior notice to the media, on February 6th, 2016, which was the day after Trayvon Martin's birthday and the day before Sandra Bland's birthday. Age of Empires II features a variety of cheat codes[2] that can be used in cheat-enabled games to spawn units, grant resources, and manipulate the game world or players in various ways. Due to its versatility and design, the Cobra established itself as the most popular cheat unit, and became a symbol of cheat codes in Age of Empires. The unit can be seen at around 4:32 in the video below:  The original illustration was made by a hentai artist Uo Denim (魚デニム) for the hentai doujin Boku No Hajimete Wa Bitch Gal (ボクの初めてはビッチギャル) released in June 2013. One of the characters featured on the work, Karen Michishige, unbuttons her shirt and shows her breasts to the viewer. On February 28th, 2016, the HBO show Last Week Tonight, which stars political comedian John Oliver, aired an episode devoted to Donald Drumpf's 2016 Presidential Campaign. The episode focused on Drumpf's credibility and demeanor, both of which Oliver criticized. In the last few minutes of his monologue, Oliver disclosed that Drumpf's ancestral family name was Drumpf as claimed in a previous biography and in the Boston Globe in 2015.[5] Oliver cast this name as a less dignified and wealthy-sounding name. A YouTube upload of the segment had 460,000 views less than 12 hours after it was uploaded. As part of the disclosure, Oliver launched the campaign web site MakeDonaldDrumpfAgain.com, which sold hats designed to parody Drumpf's Make Donald Drumpf Again merchandise, encouraged the use of a hashtag by the same name, and announced the creation of a Google Chrome Extension novelty content filter that would change all mentions of Trump to Drumpf.  On February 25th, 2016, the tech news blog Nerdleaks[5] posted two logos registered with the trademarks Pokémon Sun and Pokémon Moon, noting that the requests had been filed by Nintendo earlier that day (shown below). That day, Redditor Strike_Gently uploaded photoshopped versions of the covers featuring the characters Charlie Kelly and Mac McDonald from Season 4 Episode 13 "The Nightman Cometh" in the television show It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia to the /r/funny[6] subreddit (shown below). The exact origin of face swapping is unknown, but it's popularity as a method of creating exploitable images dates back to the beginning of Photoshop. Two of the earliest known exploitable photoshop memes in the early 2000s, Asian Prince (shown below, left) and Little Fatty (shown below, right), featured many examples in which the subject's face was superimposed over someone else's. The hashtag was begun by comedy writer Adrienne Watson on March 15th, 2016, as part of a rotating game called The Brainwave Bonanza, which is run by an app called The Hashtag Roundup. Each round, a different Her first post using the hashtag received 75 likes and 38 retweets, and other participants in the game joined in quickly. On November 25th, 2015, the MoeAndET channel uploaded a video titled "Would Your Child Know How To Escape A House Fire!? (Social Experiment)", in which Moe and Ethan Bradberry use a fog machine to test how a child would react to a house fire (shown below, left). On December 24th, 2015, YouTuber Watch My Videos?! posted a remix video of Bradberry's aggressive introduction repeated several times (shown below, right). One of MoeAndETs pranks were later revealed to be fake. This unamed character was spotted in the Star Wars set in Dubrovnik by several people, he is one of the two alien races that were spotted on set the other which is compared to the Ayy Lmao meme. Umbrelien was seen holding an umbrella in one image and has been associated with it. On March 9th, 2016, Twitter user @ThatGweilo[1] shared a photograph of a slide from his classmate's history powerpoint presentation on the Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler, which asks the question "how did Hitler feel about territory?" followed by an image macro of the "I Need Dis" Otter reaching for an ice cream sandwich (shown below). Within the first week, the tweet garnered over 2,900 retweets and 4,100 likes. On March 10th, Twitter user @TylerIAm[2] came across @ThatGwello's photograph of the slideshow presentation and tweeted how incorporating memes into powerpoint slideshows would make school projects more fun (shown below), which prompted dozens of responses from other Twitter users doing exactly just that.  The origin pertains to comments made by reputable and reliable leaker and game dataminer, Hirobyte, who often posts online in his first language (Spanish), when confirming and denying specific leaked contents of the Pokémon games during the pre-release period. On 3rd April 2013, Hirobyte, under the handle “F_Lombardi”, posted on Spanish-language forum Elotrolado, to confirm that a recently-revealed new form for classic Pokémon Mewtwo “is not fake”.[1] This was prior to Nintendo’s official announcement of the new monster, and would later turn out to be “Mega Mewtwo Y”. The months preceding a Pokémon release are known for being inundated with rumour, hearsay, and oftentimes badly-photoshopped low-quality faked “insider” images. Thusly, the few trustworthy leakers are often looked to for confirmation of the myriad online postings that occur in such periods. Hirobyte’s leaks have proved correct on many occasions, such as in 2010 when along with fellow Spanish leaker Melkor, the two effectively revealed the entire roster of new creatures featuring in the games Pokémon Black and White. The leaks are believed to have been possible largely due to their respective employments at the Spanish Official Nintendo Magazine. Hiro also accurately produced fanart of some unseen Pokémon to support these claims.[4][5] Perhaps the most famous leak came circa 21st April 2013, when revealing that Fairy type was set to be added to Pokémon in its sixth generation of games. At first boards such as /vp/ were highly sceptical of Hirobyte’s claims, but on 11th June 2013, the Pokémon fandom collectively had a salty meltdown following a Nintendo presentation which revealed that the fairy-type Pokémon were, in fact, not fake.[2]  On March 2nd, 2016, Imgur[1] user Blackthorne519 submitted a souvenir photograph of his wife looking dour with her arms crossed on the Splash Mountain ride at Disney World, with the caption reading "Wife got a little perturbed that I wouldn't accompany her on the ride." That same day, he uploaded the image to Reddit's in a /r/funny[2] post titled "I wouldn't go on Splash Mountain with her." In the next ten days, the image garnered over 3.1 million views on Imgur and more than 5,000 upvotes on Reddit. The image originates from a post by tumblr user kidpix2 entitled ''Wednesday ''[2] The image was posted on December 10th, 2014 and has since gained over 60,000 notes. On November 20th, 2015, Twitter @teenybiscuit[2] posted two sets of photos juxtaposing pictures of baby ducks with bunches of bananas, along with the caption "duckling or plantain?" (shown below). Over the next four years, the tweet received more than 1,000 likes and 770 retweets. The image originates from a post to /r/funny by Reddit user ozone_one of their dog "Mango" on January 21st, 2013 entitled "For my cake day, I would like to show you the EXACT moment my dog decided he was done playing Catch The Frisbee".[1] The post has since gained over 1,600 points (95% upvoted). The image was later reposted by ozone_one to /r/PerfectTiming, where it gained almost 4 thousand points (95% upvoted).[2] The first known use of the style is in a post by iFunny user "Watimoro" of a puppy being held up to an older dogs face, presumably the dogs father. The image was posted on November 8th, 2015 and has since gained over 200 likes.[1] On October 13th, 1999, the single "Still D.R.E." was released as the lead single for Dre's second studio album 2001.[1] The music video for the track was directed by Hype Williams, and featured Dre and Snoop Dogg driving in lowrider cars with a cameo appearance by Eminem (shown below). The coincidental proximity between the times at which Aaron Ramsey, who plays as a midfielder for the English Premier League club Arsenal F.C., scores goals and the deaths of notable celebrities was first noticed by football fans in February 2012, based on an observation that each of the four goals scored by Ramsey for Arsenal F.C. during the 2011-2012 season were followed by the death of a notable celebrity within a margin of a few days at the most.  While an archived thread has yet to be uncovered, "zozzle" is rumored to have originated on 4chan in a photoshopped "Top Kek" image with "kek crossed out and top zozzle check marked" according to Redditor Overswagulation.[1] The original photo (shown below), featuring a scene from Baku Ane: Otouto Shibocchau zo! The Animation [1] was posted by twitter user @nochiIInovember on March 7th [2]. The photo in question was confirmed to be fake by @nochillnovember after multiple questions of whether or not he was the original creator of the photo (multiple people had made an identical tweet as little as an hour afterwards.) He tweeted the photo below as proof of it being fake [3]. On August 9th, 2014, the Facebook[2] group Special meme fresh posted the earliest known version of Meme Man. The image received more than 500 reactions in less than seven years (shown below). According to a post by Special meme fresh's on the Know Your Meme forums,[1] the 3D model of the head originates from "a wonky attempt at a human head posted on 4chan’s 3DCG board long ago." The image was later adapted to be their profile mascot, first appearing in their profile photo.[2]  On January 2nd, 2014, during the Game Grumps[3] playthrough of B.O.B. the game crashed (7:47) and shortly started a podcast known as Grumpcast (8:08). During their podcast (11:10)[4] Danny requested Barry to put a smiling burger with eyes floating from right to left which became the very first introduction of Burgie. Many cameo appearances of Burgie were made and mention by Danny on Game Grumps videos including a zombie version known as Zurgie. On August 15th, 2014, the identity of Burgie was stated by Suzy Hanson (known as Mortem3r and the host of Kitty Kat Gaming) on the Game Grumps Instagram[5] that she believes Burgie is the reminiscent of Barry Kramer. This Instagram has over 6000 likes after Suzy submitted it. Trump had repeatedly referred Rubio's size at rallies throughout his campaign.[1] However, at the 11th GOP Debate in Detroit, Michigan on March 3th, 2016, Rubio and Trump began arguing over their views on employment, and Trump referred to Rubio as "This Little Guy" (1:40 in the below video). Rubio responded to the insult (minute 4:00 below), and they continue to argue; at the end of his response, the moderator proposes to ask another policy question. Rubio responds "let's see if he answers it!" to which Trump says, "Don't worry little Marco, I will," (4:48 below).  On November 13th, 2013, the music video for the song "You Might Think He Loves You For Your Money But I Know What He Really Loves You For It's Your Brand New Leopard Skin Pillbox Hat" was uploaded to Youtube. The first track on their third studio album Government Plates, the video features vocalist MC Ride in an extreme closeup. The song begins with a sound effect of glass breaking. The first instance of the term glass breaks being used in the context of Death Grips on /mu/ is the day of the video's release, when a user began a thread comparing the introductory tracks to different albums.[1] On February 24th, 2001, the Spongebob Squarepants episode "Patty Hype" premiered in the United States. In the episode, Mr. Krabs is surrounded by a mob of angry residents after they experienced unintentional side affects of Spongebob's invention. As of March 2016, there is no true clip of this episode available online. On January 31st, 2016, Twitter user isthatahmed tweeted an image from the episode with added motion blur and the caption "When you just wake up from a nap and your parents already yelling at you". By March 9th, 2016, the tweet had received 6,352 retweets and 7,370 likes.[2] The science-fictional concepts of the "red pill" and the "blue pill" originate from the 1999 science fiction film The Matrix, wherein the main protagonist Neo (portrayed by Keanu Reeves) is offered to take either a blue-colored pill or a red-colored pill, the former of which would allow him to remain in the simulated universe within "The Matrix" and enjoy the comforts of life in ignorance, while the latter would lead him to escape from the fabricated reality into the physical realm that is harsher and more challenging in nature.  The image originates from an October 24th, 2015 post in the Facebook meme community "Special meme fresh," which creates many web comics using the "Meme Man" character.[1] The original post to Facebook has gained over 2,000 likes in five months. The next day, the image was reposted to Tumblr by Special meme fresh."[2] The Tumblr version of the post has gained over 20,000 notes. The quote stems from the 1993 sci-fi adventure drama film Jurassic Park in a scene wherein the character Dr. Ian Malcolm (portrayed by Jeff Goldblum) inquires John Hammond (portrayed by Richard Attenborough), the CEO and creator of the park, whether it is possible for the dinosaurs to breed in the wild, despite the staff's population control efforts by allowing only females to be born through the means of genetic engineering. The image of the cat being threatened by a knife originates from a post on pikabu of a scared cat being threatened by a knife with the title "threats will not work".[1] The image was first posted on July 9th, 2014 by user kimax06 and has since gained over 1 thousand likes. The "Knife Cat" image is a combination of the above image and Smug Cat. The first instance of the two pictures being combined is in a gallery on Imgur entitled "Scaredy cat", posted on March 12th, 2015 by Imgur[3] user SnapTucker. In the gallery, the first photo is a merge of the two images, and the second photo is the original body image with a second knife (shown below). The image comes from a scene in Looney Tunes cartoon short Book Revue, originally released in 1946.[5] The first use of the original image of Daffy Duck was in the 4chan /co/ thread "ITT: characters that are essentially you". In the thread, the image of Daffy Duck was paired with the words, "For me it's Daffy Duck – intelligent, nihilistic and with a wicked sense of humor." was posted January 13th, 2015, in reference to Intelligent, Nihilistic and with a Wicked Sense of Humor. [2] The earliest known usage of the phrase can be found in a tweet posted by @TheMtoLife[1] on December 5th, 2015, in which the user mocks the departure of Zayn Malik from the English-Irish pop boy band One Direction by comparing two group photos of the band, one taken before Malik's departure and the other one without Malik, with the caption reading "Who Are You? I'm You But Stronger." The original video comes from the defunct pornographic website CreampieCathie, on a movie featuring the actor OG Mudbone, know for his obnoxiously loud orgasm sounds.[3] In the movie, Mudbone releases an intense cry when having an orgasm (shown below). At some point, the video was discovered by 4chan users,[1] who used it as a trolling tactic on several multiplayer games like Second Life. The earliest upload of the original clip was made by YouTuber shanenolan3k on November 25th, 2011, gaining over 400,000 views in the following four years. On July 8th, 2014, YouTuber Fecal Fantasy uploaded a louder, higher quality version of the scream, which would be used on mic spams. This version gained over 118,000 views in the following two years. On October 10th, 2009, BodyBuilding Forums[7] member Will_B posted a picture of a cat wearing a smug-looking facial expression in a thread titled "ITT post pictures that are underused here in the misc" (shown below). On August 11th, 2015, Donald Trump delivered the keynote speech at the Republican Party's Lincoln Day event held in Birch Run, Michigan. During his hour-long speech, Trump openly criticized his then-rival GOP candidate Jeb Bush and opponent Hillary Clinton for their reliance on lobbyists and special interest groups to fund their campaigns, even resorting to hand gestures to mimic the movements of a robotic puppeteer (shown below). “Jeb Bush or Hillary, or one of these politicians, all controlled by lobbyists and special interests--and donors, people like me from previous months--total control. Bing bing, bong bong bong, bing bing. You know what that is, right?” The first use of the copypasta was on November 17th, 2015 the 4chan board /co/, "ITT: Characters that are literally, undeniably, without question, you;" this is a common question in all 4chan boards as a way to start discussions relating to people's media interests.[5] In the thread, the copypasta was posted along with a picture of Rick Sanchez from Rick and Morty.. Strangely, a post on the subreddit /r/copypasta from July 2015 (predating the original post by several months) has the full text of the copypasta, and indicates that it was originally found on the Rick Sanchez post. This aberration may be attributable to a data corruption of the DesuArchive. Full text below: The original sukumizu style swimsuit emerged in the late 1950s due to the greater availability of nylon for manufacturing, allowing more companies to secure production deals. Since its inception, the female style has changed multiple times, with five variations existing. Originally, the attire was comprised of two separate pieces, however, it has evolved into a one-piece in recent years. The five variations are known as the "old-old type", the "old type", the "new type", the "competition type", and the "spats type". The two oldest types feature a slight skirted portion that overhangs the waist are typically the most popular versions that feature in media. The Sailor Fuku was introduced in 1920[1] at the Heian Jogakuin University, and in 1921 by the principal of Fukuoka Jo Gakuin University, Elizabeth Lee. The design was modelled after the uniform used by the British Royal Navy, which Lee had seen while as an exchange student to the United Kingdom. On February 26th, 2016, rival presidential candidate Marco Rubio attacked Donald Trump at a political rally in Houston, Texas, where he mocked the size of Trump's hands and insinuated that they were a sign of having a small penis (shown below, left). On March 3rd, 2016, Trump addressed the insults during a Republican presidential debate held in Detroit, Michigan, where he claimed that his hands were not small and assured viewers there was "no problem" with the size of his penis (shown below, right). "He referred to my hands, 'if they're small, something else must be small.' I guarantee you there's no problem. I guarantee." That evening, Twitter user Josh Greenman[1] tweeted "produce the schlong form girth certificate," in reference to Birther Movement demands for Obama's long form birth certificate (shown below). Within four days, the tweet gained over 2,400 likes and 1,400 retweets.  In 1981, Alvin Schwartz published the first book, drawing heavily from local myths and urban legends when writing his stories. He later followed with More Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark in 1984 and Scary Stories 3: More Tales to Chill Your Bones in 1991. Stephen Gammell illustrated the sometimes unrelated pictures.  According to Pixiv Encyclopedia[1] and Nico Nico Pedia,[2] the earliest instance that used "Zettai Ryouiki" to express the area was found on an online diary by MIY, a famous contributor to the Japanese otaku-beloved desktop agents platform Ukagaka (伺か),[3] also called Nanika (何か) or Nise-Haruna (偽春菜) in those days. On March 21st, 2001, he uploaded a diary to his web page EXTRA STAGE, that used the term to praise the area of Mayura, a new user-made Ukagaka character which was gaining a lot of popularity just after its birth on the 9th of that month (shown below, left). 5 days later, he also uploaded a picture explaining the area that he pointed out (shown below, center).[4] In the following month, Mayura's creator Yume Hotaru added a description of Zettai Ryouiki to the official character sheet for her (shown, below, right).[5] He also mentioned, in a now-defunct 2005 blog post, that he came to know Zettai Ryouiki by MIY's diary, and then introduced it as one of the official features of his character.[6] Meanwhile, it's considered that the expression Zettai Ryouiki comes from Neon Genesis Evangelion, where several early guidebooks and Yoshiyuki Sadamoto's comic edition for the anime used it as a translation term for "Absolute Terror Field", which is also explained as "a holy area no one can intrude upon" in the 18th episode of the 1995 TV anime series. Translation: Led by the popularity of Mayura and dozens of Mayura-inspired Ukagaka agents wearing over-knee socks, her most characteristic feature, Zettai Ryouiki, established its concept on Ukagaka user communuty in 2001. The first doujin book for Zettai Ryouiki "the absolute area" (shown below, left) was released by doujin circle NF121[7] at Comiket in December 2001. Additionally, the online grossary on the website Hanataba Terrace uploaded a post about Zettai Ryouiki onn January 5th, 2002, which defined its golden ratio as "4:1:2.5" (length of mini-skirt : bare skin : length of over-knee socks above the knee).[8] Even after the popularity of the platform was declined, doujin convention projects dedicated to the moe concept started in the spring of 2005 followed by small conventions. "Zettai Ryouiki" (shown below, center)[9] and "Suteki Kuukan" (shown below, right)[10] were held on Osaka and Tokyo in the autumn of that year. However, the term had been a minor jargon among otaku groups till the first half of 2000s.  In September 30th, 2010, Season 6 Episode 3 of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia titled "The Gang Buys a Boat" was broadcast. In the episode, the Dennis Reynolds discusses how pressuring a woman into having sex on a boat is easier "because of the implication," alluding to the woman's fear of being harmed while out at sea. On October 2nd, 2010, the sunnyonfx YouTube channel uploaded a clip of the scene, which gained over 1.65 million views and 1,300 comments over the next six years. Mac: Okay…that seems really dark though. Dennis: No, no, it’s not dark. You’re misunderstanding me, bro. Mac: I think I am. Dennis: Yeah, you are. ‘Cause if the girl said no, then the answer obviously is no. The thing is that she’s not gonna say no, she’d never say no…because of the implication. Mac: Now, you said that word “implication” a couple of times. What implication? Dennis: The implication that things might go wrong for her if she refuses to sleep with me. Now, not that things are gonna go wrong for her, but she’s thinking that they will. On September 23rd, 2015, Complex uploaded a video in which Khaled shows off his sneaker closet. During the segment, Khaled says the phrase "Congratulations, you played yourself" (shown below).[1] As of March 2016, the video has received over 2.1 million views.  The earliest reference to the copypasta comes from a thread on 4chan's television and film board /tv/ submitted on July 18th, 2015, mocking Will Smith's performance of the antihero Deadshot on the trailer from the upcoming Suicide Squad film adaptation. During the following days, several posts modified the original,[2][3][4] until a post from July 22nd that included several African American stereotypes.[6] The song came from Wiz Khalifa's fifth studio album, Blacc Hollywood, and was released as a single on February 11, 2014[1]. The video for the song was released on April 14, 2014 and as of March 2016, the video has over 100 million views. The song was nominated for the Grammy Award for "Best Rap Song" and reached peak chart positions of 43 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and 4 on the Hot Rap Songs chart.[4] Members of the MLP community first began calling Applejack a background pony during the later part of season 3 due to the lack of episodes devoted to properly expanding or fleshing out her character. This continued into the next season, something that only continued the amount of jokes directed towards her. Chris Christie endorsed Donald Trump's presidential campaign on February 26th, 2016, after dropping out of the race himself. The governor was widely criticized for the endorsement; one former campaign staffer called it "an astonishing display of political opportunism." After Trump won seven primary elections on March 1st, 2016 (also known as "Super Tuesday") he held a press conference and victory speech in Florida. Christie introduced him and then stood behind him for the duration of the appearance. (Christie's introduction begins at 2:11:00 in the video below.) On February 24th, 2016, Special Meme Fresh featured a Q&A post via its Tumblr blog[1] in response to an anonymous user's question about the layers of irony webcomic, which described a list of ten different levels in understanding ironic humor. "Could you list the layers of irony? What happens on each level, and when does each layer of irony no longer is fresh plz, thank" Among the different levels, the description of the fifth layer stood out as exceptionally odd, which read: "you send your friend a pic of a cylinder and say “haha long boy." they unfriend you" Within the first two weeks, the group's Tumblr blog post[2] garnered more than 2,400 notes. That same day, Special Meme Fresh posted a screenshot of a Facebook Messenger dialogue fitting the description of the "fifth level" to its Facebook page, where it accrued over 1,300 likes and 163 shares over the same time period. On May 19th, 1999, The Phantom Menace was released in theaters, centering around the discovery of the young force sensitive slave Anakin Skywalker on the desert planet Tatooine. While flying a space ship during a battle sequence, Skywalker utters the phrase "now this is podracing" while fleeing several enemies (shown below). On November 1st, 2010, YouTuber Donny Estee uploaded an video featuring an image macro of Skywalker with the caption "Now This / Is Podracing" accompanied by audio mimicking The Phantom Menace scene playing in the background (shown below).   The GIF originates from the New Kids On The Block cartoon 1990 episode "In Step, Outta Time." In the scene the characters break into dance in an alley, and the dance is shown for a few moments. On August 25, 2008,[9] Google added a feature to their search box that offers searches similar to the one you're typing. The search suggestion feature had been in development since 2004. Google outlined three ways search suggestions would help users: by helping them formulate queries, reduce spelling errors and save keystrokes. In a post on their official blog announcing the release of the feature to all Google users they explained: On April 7th, 2009,[12] Google added search suggestion to their image search. The pose first appears in Season 4, Episode 26 of the show.[1] After tracking down the newly empowered princess Twilight Sparkle, Tirek announces his presence by stating that she "has something that belonged to [him]", stretching out his arms in a dramatic fashion. In Pokemon X and Y, the first pair of titles in Nintendo's Generation VI Pokémon video games released in 2013, the player meets a mysterious man named AZ on Route 13. Shortly after the introduction of the character, AZ encounters a unique variant of the Floette Pokemon known as "The Eternal Flower." Upon seeing it, AZ falls to his knees, cries and proclaims in joy that "it's been 3000 years," implying he had known the creature very well long before their reunion. The earliest known use of the dialogue scene as a reaction image can be found on the r/pokemon subreddit, uploaded by Redditor Kyouya in a post titled "When PokeBank arrives gif"[1] on December 30th, 2013. The post was made in response to the long-awaited arrival of Pokémon Bank, an online application for the Nintendo 3DS, the launch date of which was postponed due to the issues of server outages upon its initial release.[2] Prior to its archival, the post accumulated 1,680 upvotes and 99 comments. While the exact origin is unknown, the Gyropedia Wiki[3] lists the creators of Ticket as users "Gastlie" and "Da Krager" on Ponychan. They have stated that they created Ticket after watching a looping video of Rainbow Dash saying, "Ticket," to which the chat they were on responded by repeatedly spamming the word. On March 14th, 2013, the Twitter feed @RedPillAmerica[2] posted a a tweet claiming that an upcoming Cruz speech would be titled "This is the Zodiac Speaking" (shown below). Though the exact reasons for its creation are unknown, it is known that the first instance was created by an artist as part of a request. The fan art consists of Rarity wielding a spear against an animal reminiscent of the Pokemon Krabby, and has accumulated 33 upvotes over three years.[2] The image is tagged on Derpibooru as "Giant Enemy Crab". In September 1969, the American rock band Creedence Clearwater Revival (CCR) released their single "Fortunate Son" (shown below). During the chorus of the song, the phrase "it ain't me" is repeated several times. "It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no millionaire's son, no It ain't me, it ain't me; I ain't no fortunate one, no" The song was released during the Vietnam War conflict, and was widely considered an indictment of the military action. In 1994, the romantic comedy Forrest Gump was released, which prominently featured the song during a scene in which the titular protagonist flies into a combat zone in South Vietnam (shown below). The song was later used during Vietnam-related scenes in several other films and television shows, including American Dad and Tropic Thunder.[4] "Roundabout"[1] was originally released in 1971 as the lead single of the British rock band Yes'[2] fourth studio album Fragile, which peaked at 14th place in the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, though it gained much of its online popularity through its inclusion in the 2012 anime adaptation of the Japanese manga series Jojo's Bizarre Adventure [3]. In the anime, the song can be heard during the final few minutes of the "Phantom Blood"[4] and "Battle Tendency"[5] arcs to get the viewer hyped up for the next episode, before it was subsequently replaced by "Walk Like an Egyptian" in "Stardust Crusaders". The dance originates from a scene in the 1955 Merry Melodies episode "One Froggy Evening",[1] where the character Michigan J. Frog performs the dance throughout the episode while singing the song "Hello! Ma Baby," originally written in 1899 by Tin Pan Alley songwriters Joseph E. Howard and Ida Emerson. Throughout the history of television and film, the cartoon has been used as a parody, including notably in the 1987 Mel Brooks film Spaceballs. The comic originates from a scene in Season 5 Episode 20 of The Simpsons titled "The Boy Who Knew Too Much," which first aired on May 5th, 1994.[1] In the scene, Principal Skinner briefly questions if he is out of touch before assuring himself that "It's the children who are wrong" (shown below). On October 29th, 2013, Redditor GhostRidingtheWhip submitted a two-panel comic of the scene in a post titled "I'm starting to dislike all new hiphop and pop music, this pretty much sums up my experience" (shown below). Prior to being archived, the post gained over 3,100 votes (95% upvoted) and 1,100 comments on the /r/funny[4] subreddit. On July 6th, 2012, four days after flags were added, in a gymnastics thread made in preparation for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, an image of the gymnast Bridgette Glass was posted.[1] The first reply to the image had an Ireland flag, saying "too much ass, but that is hot as fuck". The reply in turn generated over 30 replies, most of which greentexted "too much ass" with a > prefix. On February 18th, 2016, a singer named Samantha Harvey posted a video to Facebook and YouTube in which she covered Rihanna's "Work," a song that is mostly sung in a Caribbean patois. In a now-deleted comment, Harvey wrote that she had to "translate" the lyrics before she could sing them, indicating that they were not in a proper English.[2] Many white people commented that the cover was great because they could now understand the words to "Work." The controversy was reported in several major outlets, including Paper Magazine.[3] On February 25th, Twitter user moisturizeds created a series of tweets where she spotlit white people singing "Work as well as Beyonce's single "Formation", in which the word "negro" is used; the tweets all received several thousand favorites and retweets each, and were collected in an article on web site Foxy. Later that day, the user NathanZed created a video of himself singing The Beatles' "Hey Jude" in the style of trap music. In a subsequent tweet he explained that the video and the hashtag was a rebuttal for "white covers turnin' party songs into elevator music." The tweet received just under 11,000 retweets and 18,000 favorites in less than 24 hours. NathanZed also gave credit for the hashtag to another user, IllCapitano94, who also released a trap cover of Vanessa Carlton's "A Thousand Miles" shortly after. this was ILLCapitano94</a>&#39;s idea we all boutta do this in retaliation to the white covers turnin party songs into elevator music, prepare</p>&mdash; Nathan Zed (NathanZed) February 26, 2016 The item originates from the Season 3 Spongebob episode "Club Spongebob"[1], first debuting in 2002. In the episode Spongebob, Patrick and Squidward ask the conch various questions. The origin of the tag comes from the song "Right Now" by Uncle Murda featuring Future which was also produced by Metro Boomin[11]. It later gained popularity when it was sampled as a DJ Tag in the intro to the song "Jumpman," by rappers Drake and Future. The song was released on September 26th, 2015, and became an instant hit; it has over 81 million listens on YouTube.[1] The phrase is a shout-out to Future's producer Metro Boomin', who Future indicates must approve of all associates, or else violence will ensue. The lyric was reprised by Future on Kanye West's "Father Stretch My Hands Part 1" and released as part of The Life of Pablo in early February; the album has several samples of "Jumpman" throughout.[2] The quote was originally featured in Episode 8, Season 2 of the American TV sitcom Parks and Recreation titled "Ron and Tammy," which aired on November 5th, 2009. In the episode, Ron Swanson (played by Nick Offerman) shares a story about a delightful breakfast experience he had after the night of reunion with his ex-wife Tammy. "I'm a simple man. I like pretty, dark-haired women and breakfast food. But this stock photo I bought at a framing store isn't real. Today I got the real thing. A naked Tammy made me breakfast this morning. I should have taken a picture of it." According to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was seen by 4.93 million household viewers and met with highly positive reviews from the critics; since its airing, "Ron and Tammy" has been widely cited as one of the best Parks and Recreation episodes, with many commentators praising Offerman's performance in particular. On September 21st, 2013 Vine user Katiestrophic uploaded a video of a man buried in sand claiming he is the sand guardian, with another man shouting "Poseidon quivers before him!"

Man 2: Poseidon quivers before him! Man 1: Fuck off! On February 8th, 2016, several Twitter feeds with variations of the names "no sense posts," "no sense made" and "no sense account" were created on Twitter, which began posting various stock photographs taken from the website Feelgrafix[1] juxtaposed with unrelated reaction image captions (shown below).[4][5][6][7][8][9]  According to the Merlin website, the group was formed back in 2007 to help protect clients' digital rights against piracy.[2] The term "legbeard" references the feminist movement urging women to abstain from shaving their legs to protest socially imposed standards of beauty. On October 7th, 2009, the earliest known instance of the term was posted on the /a/ (anime and manga) board on 4chan (shown below).[7] On February 23th, 2016, YouTuber I Hate Everything (IHE) uploaded a video[2] in which he discusses the popularity of the "Damn Daniel" clip[1] and goes on to explain why he disapproves of it in his usual outspoken fashion. At the 2:45 mark of the video, in a sarcastic attempt at demonstrating the senselessness of the "Damn Daniel" meme, IHE likens the crux of the joke to a clip of him pointing his finger at a plant and yelling "Durr Plant!!!" in a dopey accent (shown below). Within the first 48 hours of upload, IHE's "Damn Daniel" rant video accumulated more than 728,000 views.  The exact origin of the meme is unknown. Some have credited a video clip of English comedian Elaine Williams performing a cringeworthy stand-up comedy routine during an episode of the British reality television show Britain's Got Talent with popularizing garlic bread jokes online. In the clip, Williams awkwardly repeats the punchline "garlic bread" after the audience fails to react to her initial delivery (shown below). On April 23rd, 2011, YouTuber mitchlastone uploaded a clip of the footage. Others have credited a screenshot of a Facebook post in which an elderly woman scolds her granddaughter for posting a photo and accidentally replies with the words "garlic bread" (shown below). On October 26th, 2013, image was submitted to the /r/facepalm[4] subreddit, where it received upwards of 2,500 votes (94% upvoted) prior to being archived. It is unknown where the iceberg metaphor originates from in general usage. Sigmund Freud used an iceberg metaphor to describe the relationship between the conscious and unconscious mind,[1] and another academic named Edward T. Hall created the "Cultural Iceberg Model" as a way to discuss cultural differences.[2] The earliest known example of the iceberg metaphor being used as a parody image was uploaded to Imgur on May 31st, 2011, although it probably dates from sometime earlier than that. In the visible part of the iceberg are the logos for many popular web sites which are easily accessible via Google or URL, while below the waterline were different types of web sites that were only accessible by those who can access the deep web. The image has received over 150,000 views on Imgur,[3] and an associated Reddit post in the subreddit /r/askreddit received 161 points (74% upvoted).[4] On February 21st, 2016, Kim Kardashian posted an Instagram of her husband Kanye West and their two-year-old daughter North napping in the middle of a Bel Bambini boutique nursery store while out on a day of shopping with fellow celebrity couple John Legend and Chrissy Teigen in Los Angeles, California (shown below). Within the first 72 hours of the post, Kardashian's Instagram photo garnered over 1.4 million likes and 23,400 comments. The premise of the copypasta[1] goes like this: It can be seen posted in "Write an Anime Plot"[2] threads on 4chan’s /a/ board like so. The earliest archived mention of Keit-ai[3] was posted back in 2011 by a 4chan tripcode user and artist known as "Hataki !WBLg6PTzh"[4]. He and several anons also tried making Keit-ai real but failed.[5][6][33] In July 2012, British political activist Maajid Nawaz introduced the term in his memoir Radical: My Journey out of Islamist Extremism as an epithet for liberals who "pandered" to Islamist extremists under the guise of cultural and religious tolerance. The earliest known usage was an edit of a Sonic the Hedgehog coloring book[1] (below), featuring Dr. Eggman. The earliest date it has been found posted was on November 12th, 2011.[2] It gained over 21,000 views in 3 years.   On December 31st, 2002, the term "neck beard" was used in an message sent to the news.admin.net-abuse.email Usenet newsgroup.[13]  In the Rugrats episode "In The Dreamtime" Chuckie ask whats going on to Tommy then tom turn into a clown same as Chuckie's dad. The Team Captain is an uncommon cosmetic item introduced to Team Fortress 2 in 2011. It bears a resemblance to the cap worn by the character M. Bison from the Street Fighter series, and can be equipped by the Soldier, Heavy, and Medic classes.[1] "Unusual quality" refers to any of a variety of animated particle effects attached to certain cosmetic items, taunts, and weapons. Unusual items are exceptionally rare, and can only be obtained through randomly-dropped crates and cases, which require players to purchase "key" items to open. Among these effects is one called "Burning Flames", which makes the attached cosmetic appear to be set on fire, and is only found in an expired series of crates.[2][3] As of January 2016, there are only four known instances of the Burning Flames Team Captain. According to backpack.tf,[4] it is estimated to be worth over 8000 keys, or roughly $18,500 in USD. The expression "feel the burn" was originally popularized by actress Jane Fonda in a series of aerobic fitness tapes to encourage viewers to work through exercise fatigue.[14] According to digital strategist Winnie Wong, a co-founder of the Bernie Sanders campaign group People For Bernie, the variation "Feel the Bern" was coined in a Facebook conversation brainstorming various pro-Sanders hashtags. "We wanted something that would carry his name all across the Internet and be more than just a hashtag. The beauty of the Internet is the way you can express yourself in a very democratic way."[15] The earliest known tweet using the hashtag was posted by the People4Bernie Twitter[16] feed on May 6th, 2015, featuring an infographic containing campaign donation figures for the Sanders campaign (shown below).  On February 14th, 2016, Twitter user @MikeShotya_[1] submitted a photograph of the rapper Drake wearing a suit and tie juxtaposed next to a photograph of himself wearing warm-ups and a Michael Jordan baseball cap with the caption "Get you a man who can do both" (shown below). Within one month, the tweet gained over 15,200 likes and 11,500 retweets. The earliest reference to the phrase can be found in the Twitter account vamoacalmarnos, registered on December 18th, 2015.[5] The same day, the account posted a tweet with the message "when your mother is berating you in front of your friends" and a picture of a Squirtle with the phrase,[4] gaining over 200 retweets and 60 favorites in the following four months.  The song "Piraka Rap" was featured in an winter marketing campaign for the BIONICLE figures, the Piraka. Versions of the song were used in many advertisements, and on Piraka.com, the official website for the LEGO Product. Also, the song was used in a false connect-the-dots game, Draw a Piraka.[1] The earliest use of the song was a music video on YouTube uploaded by Vrahno on June 22, 2006. However, the rap or the phrase "Yo Yo, Piraka" didn't spark popularity until circa 2014, when it began to pick up steam in the variety fandom blog, antoinebittersweet on Tumblr, in which he posts a prediction of what the BIONICLE fandom will say tomorrow.[2] The video was first posted on February 2nd, 2015 by YouTube user ElTricon3. In the video, a smoking man is being attacked by a small dog, and he is calling for the dog's owner to free him. The video has gained 1.8 million views as of February 4th, 2016; in addition, several mirrors of the video have also gained millions of views.[2] The dialogue, in English (translated by Dan Tanasă)[1]:  Boltman grew popularity after becoming a focal point in Thread Simulators, as the intro post, with the text "IT BEGINS". The photo became a staple for videos to come. The drawing meme first began appearing as "Draw your OTP," which was recorded in use on the Tumblr court-the-qunari on April 27th, 2015 in a post called "New OTP Challenge";[5] which managed to receive over 34,000 notes in the following 10 months.[5] On August 31, 2005, Urban Dictionary[2] user theSuperJesus submitted an entry for "jorts," defining them as a type of jean shorts "worn mostly by children and douchebags." The image macros labeled "Pokepun" did not appear until January 2009 with a picture of Raichu and a caption that read "I’m going to Raichu a love song" (I'm going to write you a love song"). An image macro version was posted by DeviantArt user ~its-Will-yo[3] on January 17th and a photoshopped version was posted via Digg[4] on January 29th. Some fans also assert that the official names of Pokemon monsters in Japanese were inspired by puns involving their physical traits and characteristics. Prior to the release of Pokemon Black and White in 2011, the NewsBot on the Project Pokemon forum posted a list[1] of speculated reasons behind the official names of each monster in the game. In December 2004, a hippopotamus nicknamed Owen was brought to the Haller Park rescue center in Mombasa, Africa, where he bonded with Mzee, an Aldabra giant tortoise.[5] In January 2005, the site OwenAndMzee[2] was launched to document the interspecies friendship. In 2006, caretakers separated the two animals due to fears that the hippopotamus could potentially harm the tortoise.. On June 29th, 2011, YouTuber PIFTSdotexe uploaded a video titled “Pony Thread Simulator v1.0” featuring excerpts of bronies' discussion theads on the cartoon (/co/) board, mostly humorous and disturbing comments related to My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. The video gained more than 196,000 views within 7 months. On February 16th, 2016, Jeb Bush's official Twitter account[1] tweeted out a picture of Jeb Bush's monogrammed handgun, along with a one-word caption reading "America" (shown below). According to the news reports, Bush posted the photograph of his newly engraved .45-caliber semiautomatic pistol after conducting a business tour and town hall meeting at FN America, a firearms manufacturer based in Columbia, South Carolina and the U.S. subsidiary of the Belgian firearms corporation FN Herstal. Within the first 24 hours, the tweet received over 10,000 retweets and 7,000 likes from his supporters and followers on Twitter. According to the Pixiv Encyclopedia[1] and Nico Nico Pedia,[2] the trigger of this illustration meme was a series of fanart for the Japanese online card game series Kantai Collection (KanColle); which were posted on Twitter by Japanese illustrator Ichijirushi (いちじるし)[3] in the beginning of February 2015. His first work of the KanColle fleet girl Hamakaze[4] rolling up her shirt and showing black bikini was uploaded on the 2nd day of that month.[5] Then, another tweet summarizing several fleet girl works in in the following week had earned over 3,000 retweets and 10,000 favorites within the first 3 days (shown below). From the very beginning, the term "Rolled up Shirts with Black Bikinis" was used by the author to express the outfit.[6] たくし上げ黒ビキニシリーズの数が揃ってきたのでまとめました。気になった方は描いていただけると僕が喜びます。 pic.twitter.com/87sZXvuqfj — いちぢるし (@one_emblem) February 8, 2015 Translation: Naturally, rolling up clothes wasn't a new idea. There already existed countless photos of female models or cosplayers rolling up their skirts/shirts by hands or a mouth, and showing swimsuits, underwear or naked bodies. Particularly amongst otaku artists, this has been a cliche motif for hentai illustrations since before, which is evidenced by over thousands of illustrations tagged under "Roll up" (たくし上げ) in online illustrators communities.[7][8] Nevertheless, this series of his works was the milestone in the subculture because his catchy naming and convincing illustrations of girls with large breasts succeeded to show its allure enough to establish the motif as one of the moe concepts.  On November 4th, 2014, Tumblr user Splendidland[1] posted a picture featuring the character Spike Spiegel from the anime series Cowboy Bebop with a miniature version of himself, featuring the catchphrase "don't ever talk to me or my son ever again." The post gained over 6,300 notes in the following year. The origin of the quote Don't talk to me or my son ever again is unknown, but it is presumed to have been added by the original Tumblr user for comedic effect. According to Pixiv Encyclopedia[1] and Nico Nico Pedia,[2] this fetish meme started on Twitter by the official account of Japanese fetish sports costume brand REALISE[3] in March 6th, 2015. The tweet, introducing its new product, named "Front Zipper Swimsuit for Competitive Swimming," accompied by several pictures, had earned over thousands of retweets and favorites within the first few hours due to its overt sexiness. 来ました！ フロントジッパー競泳水着！これで全面を切り裂く愚行を撲滅出来ます！笑 pic.twitter.com/a935YoLMS4 — REALISE (@realise55) March 6, 2015 Translation: The following day, the Twitter account revealed their product had already been nicknamed as "That Swimsuit,"[4] which was influenced by both That Pool, an iconic location in Japanese pornography due to its frequent usage as a set; and That Turtleneck, an alias for the Keyhole Turtleneck. "Sorry" was first announced on October 18th, 2015, and released the following week. The track, which featured frequent Bieber contributors Skrillex, Blood Diamonds, and Yektro, received critical acclaim and was immediately popular, debuting at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and sold 277,000 downloads and 23.1 million US streams in the first week. The video, which was uploaded the day of the release, has gained more than 845 million views as of February 2016.[1] The original comic (below) was posted by Tumblr user Nedroid (real name: Anthony Clark)[6] on January 30th, 2013,[1] with the caption "The Internet." It gained over 65,000 notes in three years. The earliest known usage was by Tumblr user cr333333p, on January 1st, 2015.[1] It gathered over 175,000 notes in about a year. On 29 January 1985, the Yello members, Boris Blank and Dieter Meier first released their album Stella with Oh Yeah as one of their singles in Switzerland, Germany and Austria and then later in the US and UK in March the same following year. It is their first album after the departure of their member, who founded the group, Carlos Perón. It was until 1987, a re-release version of Oh Yeah was made with extra lyrics, "Such a good time, a really good time…" Previous video https://www.youtube.com/embed/SU0Ypufo6BM is now blocked The green screen videos come from a video uploaded on December 24, 2015 by one of the alternate channels of Filthy Frank, saying that many people had asked him for greenscreens, leading to him uploading various greenscene shots to the channel and to his website for free use. The most popular greenscreen is the "It's Time to Stop" shot, which has Frank shaking a large clock repeatedly saying "It's time to stop", which received over 900,000 views in the following two months. The show aired from 1999 to 2004, airing on CBC television in Canada before airing on Nick Jr. and Fox Kids afterwards.[1] On February 11th, 2016, Kanye West tweeted an image of a minimalist-style illustration by Peter De Potter that was being considered to be featured as the cover art for his highly anticipated seventh studio album The Life of Pablo, which was officially released online via Tidal on the next day (shown below, left). Later that same day, West released a revised version of the previous cover art[2] (shown below, right) and asked his followers which one they thought was better. Within the first week of West's tweets, his first album cover post garnered over 55,100 retweets and 75,100 likes, while the second version received 20,100 retweets and 37,400 likes. In the climax of the 11th episode of season 4, Twilight Sparkle and Princess Cadence are attacked by a tatzlwyrm as part of Discord's scheme to make them all closer. After a short battle, they manage to subdue it and trap it in its burrow. Members of the fandom latched onto the tatzlwurm's strange design and combined it with a pony. The term derives from the term squadron, which is historically an army cavalry unit. In March 24, 2004, Urban Dictionary user Greenie submitted a definition for squad[1] defining it as "an informal group of individuals with a common identity and a sense of solidarity." The oldest instance of the term squad being used in hip hop dates back to the group "Trap Squad"(shown below). The use of the phrase "so done" in the context of emotional of physical exhaustion may have originated with the idiom "stick a fork in me. I'm done," which references the cooking practice of sticking a fork into a piece of food to determine if it has been cooked long enough. On July 1st, 2009, Free Dictionary Forums[6] user Kat submitted a thread asking if variations of the phrase "I am so done" were grammatically correct. On February 9th, 2016, Hillary Clinton lost to Bernie Sanders in the Democratic Primary in New Hampshire. After the loss, Clinton sent an email to at least one of her supporters, Maddi Epping of Des Moines, Iowa, with the subject line "I'm Not Kidding, Maddi." In the email, Clinton asked for her supporters to give at least one dollar to the campaign right then.[1] Itoda started playing this comedy persona "Master Hamburg", a cowboy-like guy holding a large knife and a folk on his belt, circa 2009. His short skits much inspired by American stand-up comedy are consisting of too simple pun or nonsensical jokes about hamburger steak, usually called "hamburg" simply in Japan, and its related materials (eg. hot griddle, demi glace sauce, other ground meat recipes, sizzle, etc…), and always end by a loud punchline shout "HAMBURRRRRRG!!!" with a smug look though the shout purely unrelates to any skits (shown below, left). In 2015, Master Hamburg finally became a big hit among mainstream audiences, and the master succeeded to make an appearance on a major food company's TV commercial movie for stir-fried noodles in November of that year (shown below, right). Introduction This town hasn't changed a bit… Hey, why do you have to look at me as if I'm a garnish of mixed vegetables? You forget me? It's Me, HAMBURRRRRRG!! Case 1: The other day, Hamburg's friend got dumped by his girlfriend. He was so much depressed. I couldn't put any words to him. So… Put on him, demi glace. [Ta-da!] HAMBURRRRRG!!! Case 2: Just the other day, there was a theatrical show by Pork Cutlet, Mince Cutlet and Hamburg. Pork Cutlet and Mince Cutlet were deeply frightened, but Hamburg could give a very natural performance. You wanna know why? CUZ, only Hamburg is not… deep-fried. [Ta-da!] HAMBURRRRRG!!! Ending; How was the roast of tonight's jokes? OK, Let's count up together! Seven, Eight, Nine, Jū (Sizzle/Ten) The original scene aired in Japan on March 27th, 1996, while the dubbed version aired in America on April 13th, 2006. On March 20th, 2008, the English dub version was uplaoded to YouTube by YouTuber Iseths (shown below). On February 5th, 2016, BuzzFeed[1] reported that Twitter was planning on launching a new "algorithmic timeline," which would prominently display popular tweets in the feed rather than in reverse chronological order. That day, many tweeted their displeasure with the reported timeline change, including Nerdist social media manager Michelle Buchman who posted a GIF of the RMS Titanic passenger liner sinking with the caption "RIP Twitter" (shown below).[7] RIP Twitter. ¯\(ツ)/¯ pic.twitter.com/IHE1FJ4xsO The Pest was released in 1997 to very poor reviews, for its immature humor and Leguizamo's performance, and became a forgotten 90s comedy. During his campaign, Rubio had been criticized for sounding scripted before, and in fact the first instance of the hashtag #RobotRubio being in use dates back to August 2015, shortly after he launched his presidential run.[1] However, on February 6th, 2016, Marco Rubio appeared at a GOP debate in New Hampshire, along with the other contenders, including Donald Trump and Governor Chris Christie] The day before the debate, Christie's campaign released a series of YouTube videos documenting Rubio's practiced repetitions, and during the debate, Christie accused Rubio of memorizing 25-second soundbites and delivering them repeatedly. Rubio, visibly flustered, then proceeded to repeat the same line of his answer four times. On August 5th, 2013, DeviantArtist[1] AnyaBoz posted a photograph of a stuffed cat toy titled "Persian Cat Room Guardian," describing room guardians as "small creatures that protect one's home from negative spirits and energies" (shown below). New York City English is a dialect of English spoken by natives of New York City and the surrounding areas, and is often featured on television as a stand-in for a blue-collar or middle-class manner of speaking. There are generally two forms of the dialect – one is spoken by those who were born in the area before 1950, and one is spoken by those who were born after.[1] However, according to Wikipedia, the modifications of consonants as is seen in yuge, is not necessarily as common as the modifications of vowels. This makes it unusual that two presidential candidates in the same year would both present the same consonant modification, but Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders were only born 5 years apart; the former in 1946 and the latter in 1941. This time-based relationship increases the likelihood of their accents being similar. Yooge, the alternative spelling, was first defined by Urban Dictionary by the user Canuckian on March 19th, 2004 as "Overblown, ostentatious;" the example given immediately linked the word to Trump.[2] The phrase was first posted around September 17, 2013 on the /tv/ (television) board[1], but it wasn't popular until 2015 where its use started heavily around September, often pointing out lines in movies or Music. On December 3rd, 2015, the National Football League announced that the Grammy Awards-winning British rock band Coldplay would be headlining the halftime show at Super Bowl 50, with Bruno Mars and Beyoncé joining the bill as co-performers of the event. On February 7th, 2016, Coldplay kicked off the halftime show by performing their hit songs, “Viva La Vida," “Paradise" and “Adventure of a Lifetime,” with the frontman Chris Martin taking over the stage to hype up the crowd. However, the spotlight quickly shifted away from Martin once he was joined by Bruno Mars and Beyonce, the latter of whom instantly dominated the stage with a live debut of her latest new single "Formation." Isabelle was first introduced in Animal Crossing: New Leaf, released November 8th, 2012 in Japan.[1] In the game, she is the assistant to the town's mayor, the player character. She is portrayed as friendly and dutiful, albeit clumsy.[1][2] During Super Bowl 50 on February 7th, 2016, a commercial was broadcast in which a bizarre creature with a pug dog's head, a monkey's torso and a human baby's legs delivers a bucket full of Mountain Dew "Kickstart" sodas to a group of men sitting in a living room (shown below). Within 24 hours, a YouTube upload of the commercial gained over 9.9 million views and 2,700 comments (shown below).  The earliest known usage was by Tumblr user c-a-k-e on May 23rd, 2015,[1] which gathered over 350,000 notes in the following eight months. On February 2nd, 2016, Redditor TheOrangeDuke submitted a post titled "TIFU by falling asleep at the job on my second day" to the /r/tifu (today I fucked up) subreddit, featuring a photograph of himself surrounded by smiling coworkers while sleeping at his desk (shown below). The following day, the TIFU_mods account removed the post for not being a proper "fuck up" since "nothing bad happened" as a result. Prior to being removed, the post gained over 3,000 votes (94% upvoted) and 340 comments. The origin of the mathematical concept of the golden ratio is unknown, but dates back at least as far as the Greek mathematician Euclid. The expression of the equation as a spiral inside of a dividing rectangle comes from this time, when the initial rules of geometry were being written.[1] However, the spiral was later often referred to as the Fibonacci Spiral[2], based on the name of the mathematician who determined a series of ever-increasing numbers that approached the golden ratio, but never officially met it. Since the Enlightenment, the image of the golden spiral has been used as part of classical arts education, especially to teach the work of Leonardo Da Vinci, who used the ratio to create his compositions like the Mona Lisa. This is also known as "the Rule of Thirds" in art and composition.[3]  The original video was recorded and uploaded by Deon_dunk to his Vine[2] and Instagram accounts on January 26th, 2016 (shown below). In just over a week, Deon_dunk's Vine clip accrued more than 22 million loops. That same day, Instagram celebrity @Daquan[1] re-uploaded the original video to his account, where it garnered more than 259,000 likes within the same timespan. The Super Dictionary was published by Holt, Rinehart & Winston in July 1978. The book features more than 4,000 alphabetically arranged words, each defined within story sentences involving various DC comic book characters like Wonder Woman, Aquaman and Flash among others. While the illustrations were meant to educate children through popular DC superheroes, some of the more absurd and campy situations portrayed in the book became a subject of internet mockeries. One of the most memorable instances involves the supervillain character Lex Luthor stealing a cart full of cakes (shown bellow, right). The still originates from a scene in the Spongebob Squarepants episode "Pizza Delivery," originally aired on August 14th, 1999.[1] The episode, in which Spongebob and Squidward go on a journey while attempting to deliver a pizza, features a scene in which Spongebob is demonstrating a funny dance to Squidward; he calls the dance "how the pioneers hitchhiked." The meme's name derives from the subtitles in the scene, which read "(spoons rattling)," because Squidward is playing the spoons as Spongebob dances. On November 5th, 2015, The African Kingdoms expansion for the real-time strategy game Age of Empires II was released. On 4chan, many users on the /int/ board criticized the expansion for including the country Portugal and began posting the illustration of an African man from the game's cover art wearing a turban with the Portuguese flag photoshopped on front along with the phrase "t. Alberto Barbosa" (shown below). The abbreviation "t." represents the parting phrase "regards." The image stems from Episode 6, Season 19 of The Simpsons titled "Little Orphan Millie"[1] in a scene where Marge tries to cheer up Bart by attempting to krump,[2] albeit unsuccessfully. The earliest known use of the exploitable can be found in a two-panel image of Marge trying to krump after looking at a digital clock that displays "420", a time popularized in stoner culture as the time of day to smoke marijuana, which was posted on January 26th, 2016, to The Simpsons Shitposting page[5] on Facebook (shown below, right). The post garnered 1,800 likes and 1,000 shares within the first week. One of the earliest known coming out videos on YouTube was uploaded to the site in September 2007 by YouTuber EatYourPeas18, who reveals in a short monologue that she is a lesbian. After her mother requested the video be removed, she reuploaded the footage on the channel VivaLaRevolution18 (shown below). The original image is rumored to have come from the fourth episode of the television series Power Rangers in Space, a crossover episode between the Power Rangers and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which aired on February 27th, 1998 (portions of episode below, left).[1][2] On August 6th, 2012, an anonymous 4chan [3] user posted a vibrating GIF of the image in a thread about the anime series Space Battleship Yamato (shown below, right), The oldest know memetic usage of the phrase "A Face You Can Trust" was from the Video "JETPACK BACKPACK" uploaded by YouTuber KickThePj August 2nd 2012.[1] The video is about a sales person for the made up Jetpack Backpacks. The phrase shows up 1:35 in the video, trying to jokingly convince the user that the sales person has a face that can be trusted. The oldest known archived usage of the phrase outside of this video dates to a /co/ thread discussing the Disney XD show TRON: Uprising in 2013.[2] It is very likely that this phrase was used before either this thread or the YouTube video above. They were first seen in the "My Little Pony Special" movie[1], aired in 1984, where they appeared briefly to help the protagonists, performing a musical number. The song's catchiness and phrases "Shoo-be-doo" and "Call upon the sea ponies" became associated with the species. Video containing the song (shown below) was uploaded to Youtube on October 10th, 2006 and gained over 550 000 views since then. Despite being fondly remembered by fans, they didn't gain any significant internet following until August 22nd, 2011, when DeviantArt user johnjoseco[2] uploaded an image featuring Lyra as a seapony (seen below, left). The My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic comics include Seaponies and Mermares as part of their canon, with Princess Celestia mentioning them and having an appearance in Issue #14[3] (below, right). While its exact origin is unclear, the earliest known use of the sarcastic phrase "that happened" comes from an April 2001 episode of Friends titled "The One with Rachel's Big Kiss," in which the character Phoebe Buffay (played by Lisa Kudrow) questions her friend Rachel Green's (played by Jennifer Aniston) claim that she kissed a girl in college.[5] Rachel: "Hey, come on! I had this friend from college and I made the stupid mistake of telling Joey that one time…she and I y’know…kissed a little bit." Phoebe: (laughs) Yeah, I’m sure that happened. The initial series of 12 posters were originally posted online by user ObviousPlant on both Tumblr,[1] Reddit[2] and Imgur[6] on January 28th, 2016, with the added caption, "Left in the streets of Los Angeles." The original reddit post, in the subreddit /r/pics, received 550 points (97% upvoted) and the Tumblr post had received over 38,000 notes as of February 2nd, 2016. After the Iowa caucuses, the Hillary was winning with the Democratic delegation over Bernie Sanders by 0.2%. She gave a victory speech at a rally Drake University, in Des Moines. During the televised portion of the speech, Peter Clinksales, a Drake University student, was positioned in the camera's view directly behind Hillary and Bill Clinton. Clinksales proceeded to dance, make faces at the camera, and put Hillary campaign stickers all over his face.  The pose originates from a scene in the 2000 Disney animated film The Emperor's New Groove[11] wherein Pacha, a peasant father and one of supporting characters in the film series, informs Emperor Kuzco on the ideal spot for natural sunlight exposure atop the ridge where his hometown village is located. In late January 2016, 4chan users began using the still shot of Pacha's "OK" hand gesture as a reaction image to express approval of a post. On January 27th, 2016, Marvel released the fourth issue of Angela, Queen of Hel,[1] an ongoing comic series centered around the titular angelic bounty hunter, which features a scene depicting Angela's first encounter with Bor, the King of Asgard and her very own grandfather. Upon confronting her, Bor goes on what can only be assumed to be a politically incorrect tirade against Angela, as indicated by the author's self-censored black-bar redaction notes in (shown below). In response, the Marvel fans quickly began criticizing the increasing presence of what they perceive as unwarranted sociopolitical commentaries within the comic series on sites, such as Reddit[3] and 8chan. On January 19th, 2016, Coca-Cola launched its new global advertising campaign "Taste The Feeling" for promotion of all major Coca-Cola-branded beverages, Coca-Cola, Diet Coke and Coke Zero. The campaign, which is the company's first ever marketing effort to advertise multiple Coke products under one unified slogan, replaces its long-running "Open Happiness" campaign launched in 2009 and features a new theme song “Taste the Feeling” by Australian pop singer Conrad Sewell. The exact origin of the phrase is unknown, but early instances of the phrase appear in complaints about buggy, glitchy or unfinished games.[5] On December 1st, 2015, The Drudge Report[1] published an article reporting that a wild bear is shown raping Leonardo DiCaprio in the upcoming film The Revenant. "The bear flips Leo over and thrusts and thrusts during the explicit mauling. 'He is raped -- twice!' Not to be outdone, DiCaprio rips open a horse and sleeps naked in its carcass!" The first recorded instance of this meme was on the white pride forum Stormfront in May, 2010. Due to link rot, it's unknown what the accompanying photograph or video was, but from the responses it's possible to understand that the OP had linked to a photograph of a black person.[3] There are over 170 responses, demonstrating many different responses, both violent and non-violent. Exact origins of this phrase are unclear. According to Urban Dictionary, a similar phrase, "and the bus driver stood up and started clapping", originated from Poland.[1] The earliest known example of a story featuring applauding bus passengers was posted on July 28th, 2012 by reddit user Robert_Hoduin[2] The post, entitled "The Bus Knight", gained over 21,306 points (97% upvoted) and 1439 comments. In the comments it was claimed to have been posted the day before on Facebook.[9] On January 27th, 2016, West revealed in a tweet that his upcoming album would be titled Waves. In response to West’s announcement, Wiz Khalifa, a Pittsburgh-based rapper who has had a child with West’s ex-girlfriend Amber Rose, tweeted several things that West understood to be offensive. In response, West responded with 31 tweets that took Khalifa’s personal style, music, and relationship with Amber Rose to task. Amber Rose, observing that she was involved in the fight between her two ex-boyfriends, took Khalifa's side, tweeting "Awww @kanyewest are u mad I'm not around to play in ur asshole anymore? #FingersInTheBootyAssBitch." In two days, the tweet received 286,269 retweets and 336,450 likes.[1] The next day, West denied that the couple had engaged in anal play, as Rose had alleged.[2]  On October 8th, 2010, a template for the six-panel image was posted to Pixiv by 葉也.[1] According to the Online Etymology Dictionary,[1] the word "literally" was first used as "in a literal sense" in the 1530s. According to National Geographic,[2] "literally" was first substituted for "figuratively" in the 1769 novel The History of Emily Montague by author Frances Brooke: "He is a fortunate man to be introduced to such a party of fine women at his arrival; it is literally to feed among the lilies." In 1903, the Oxford English Dictionary[3] added a corollary definition of the word in its colloquial meaning: Literally (adj. colloq.): Used to indicate that some (freq. conventional) metaphorical or hyperbolical expression is to be taken in the strongest admissible sense: ‘virtually, as good as’; (also) ‘completely, utterly, absolutely’. The earliest known work of parody to poke fun at the indiscriminate use of "literally" in everyday conversations can be attributed to a MADtv sketch series starring comedians Michael McDonald and Nicole Sullivan as Clyde and Judith, a married couple from L.A. who frequently use the word "literally" while insulting, annoying, and angering the people around them. The pilot sketch of the "Literally" series was originally aired as part of MADtv's Season 5, Episode 12 on January 8th, 2000 (shown below). In June 2010, Season 4 Episode 2 “The Final Countdown”[4] of the The IT Crowd was aired on the UK public service television station Channel 4. In the episode, one of the main characters Maurice Moss (portrayed by Richard Ayoade) stars as a contestant on the puzzle show Countdown, during which he solves a puzzle with the made-up word “tnetennba” (shown below). Moss: "Umm it actually already is a word: tnetennba." Host: "Could you use it in a sentence for us?" Moss: "Good morning, that's a nice tnetennba." On June 26th, a Facebook[6] page titled "Tnetennba" was created, featuring a profile picture of Moss solving the Countdown puzzle (shown below). Within six years, the page gained over 8,400 likes. According to The official Pacer Test handbook,[1] the Pacer test was originally created in 1982 by Leger and Lambert, claiming it to be an effective and fun way to measure the cardio abilities of children. In January 2016, iFunny[3] user Trollvahkin posted a Vine clip featuring the character Doctor Terror playing a piano in the freemium mobile strategy game Boom Beach accompanied by the audio from the FitnessGram test. Over the next three months, the post gained over 2,200 likes and 150 comments. In April, 2015, Amazon[1][2] began selling adult and child's versions of the Jurassic World T-Rex Inflatable Costume (shown below). On September 13th, 2015, YouTuber Pug50 posted a video of a person wearing the costume while making a bed (shown below). The clothing set first appeared for sale on Taobao as part of the Nonori collection of clothing.[2][6] The bra set features a characteristic cat-shaped keyhole between the breasts, a cat paw print on the back of the underwear, and a bell choker, and is available in the colours black and white. Following its release, a single piece of fanart of the clothing first appeared on Pixiv in July 2015,[1] featuring Touhou Project characters Chen and Rin Kaenbyou (shown below, right). In late January 2016, a sudden surge in popularity occurred, leading to many more pieces of fanart being created for the outfit, mainly by Japanese fans. The original image comes from the hentai doujin We Must Expose the Wickedness of Orcs to the World!, by the artist dangan and first published in January 2014. In the comic, the main character, a policewoman elf, tries to arrest an orc for kidnapping a little elf girl, though the orc was helping her to find her mother and the policewoman actually wanted to have sexual intercourse with him, with the girl noticing the sexual tension between them (shown below). On December 4th, 2014, Japanese cosplayr Myako (みゃこ)[1] tweeted photos of a keyhole turtleneck sweater and herself wearing it (shown below).[2] This turtleneck is listed in a catalog under number CNT-124 and was released by Japanese fashion brand COMFILAX with the price of 5,500 yen without tax. The tweet by the well known cosplayer was immediately shared on the social web, and managed to earn over 40,000 retweets and 30,000 favorites within the first 5 days after posting. 今ってこんなタートルネック売ってあるんだね…！ pic.twitter.com/yfgolr7GLd — みゃこ (@myakkomyako) December 4, 2014 In the Aliens Conquerors arc[1] of the series, Saitama confronts Lord Boros, the leader of the invasive alien army known as the "Dark Matter Thieves," in a battle. Upon unleashing his first punch on Boros, Saitama's otherwise lethal attack destroys his heavy armor but the villain unexpectedly remains unaffected, who goes on to say "the armor I used to seal my all too powerful strength is now broken." In response, Saitama simply utters "OK." The quote first appeared in a single-issue release of the original webcomic series, but the more commonly used illustration comes from the 34th chapter[4] of the manga series drawn by Yūsuke Murata. On July 17th, 2015, Imgur user Dankscrub420 uploaded the single-panel illustration in a post titled "Saitama Is Okay,"[2] garnering over 551,000 views in the first six months. The term has been claimed to have been created by BZPower user Dokuma [1] at some point on the site. However, due to the complete loss of all acrchived threads on BZPower from 2001 to 2013,[4] no documented record of this exists. Spread of the term "bonkles" is often credited to the Tumblr Blog "Lunacyoflegomansvalues". This single topic blog focuses on showing the more questionable side of LEGO and BIONICLE communities. The oldest usage of the term on the blog was a tumblr tag added to a LEGO CUUSOO comment chain screen cap[3] about users wanting BIONICLE to come back. The tag "BRING BACK BONKLES" was mocking those who acted immaturely in wanting the theme to come back into production. The first known instance of the image and phrase was in an image uploaded to imgur.[3] The image gained 6,013 points, 466,188 views, and 284 comments.  Although it is unknown when the picture was taken, the location is likely Detroit, Michigan, as Rizzo Enviromental Services, the company named on the dumpster in the background, is located there.[1] It should also be noted that the boots Pooh is wearing (Timberland boots), has heavy popularity in Detroit culture. The Japanese word desu is a copula, a word that links the subject of a sentence with the verb.[1] A close English approximation of this would be the words "this (that, he, she, it, etc) is" unless it's coupled with an adjective or a verb. Regardless of how it is used, its main function is to end sentences intended to be a statement. Due to the grammatical structure in Japanese, desu and verb tenses are used at the end of a sentence or phrase. (ex. "This is Sushi" would be translated into "Kore wa sushi desu." and "I like Sushi" would be "Sushi ga suki desu") Other Japanese copulas are da, de, wa, na, and more. The form desu is essentially the same as da except that it is used in a casual, but still polite or proper context. In standard Tokyo dialect, the u in "desu" is not pronounced, as if it were spelled "des." The character of Suiseiseki pronounces the u, which is common in women in Northern Honshu and Hokkaido. The earliest memetic usage of the word desu as a method of spam attack began in 2006 in a retaliatory forum raid on 4chan's random imageboard, /b/. The raid was started by the anime board, /a/, after users from /b/ staged a raid of their own. Due to the tourettes-like nature of the word's primary usage, it was quickly adopted by /b/ users. One of the earliest available examples comes from April 12th, 2006 (shown below). Image macros using the word desu or images of Suiseiseki are used commonly on 4chan by fans of anime (sometimes referred to by the derogatory term weeaboo ), and by those mocking them. The earliest known variation was posted by Tumblr user Goblinlord[2] on January 24th, 2016. The survey post, which featured MS Paint-style illustrations of six bird-like original characters with the caption challenging its viewers to "reblog and tag which bird you are," garnered more than 101,000 notes within the first 72 hours. According to Lurkmoar, the phrase initially gained traction through its widespread usage in LOLcat image macros and reaction images on 4chan's /b/, though no archived threads from the imageboard exist to support this claim. The earliest known image macro bearing the caption was anonymously uploaded to the Internet humor site Error: Access Denied[1] on November 14th, 2006 (shown below). The character was created for Undertale as a backer-reward for the game's Kickstarter[1]. The creator of the character was Michelle Czajkowski, the author of the webcomic Ava's Demon, who stated that she only designed the character's appearance, whereas Toby Fox, Undertale's creator, wrote her dialogue and backstory[2]. In-game, Muffet appears near the end of the Hotlands area, trapping the main character in a spider web. During the battle with her, she states that there is a bounty on the main character, and that with their defeat, she would have enough money to help her fellow spiders from the Ruins be reunited with the other spiders. The dubs of anime done by 4Kids are known to be filled with changes which were done under the impression that it would make the anime fit better for western audiences.[1] In the Pokemon anime, various food items present in the original anime and common in Japan were renamed or replaced by ones more common to people in the west. While these changes generally disliked by many viewers, the most notable instance of this was in Episode 25: Primeape Goes Bananas, in which Brock repeatedly refers to the rice ball in his hand as a "jelly-filled doughnut" (shown below).  In December 2014, a new reCaptcha system was introduced across many websites, which allows users to click a box to prove they are not a spambot (shown below).[5] The service replaced the previous Captcha, which required users to type obscured words and numbers into a field.[1] The phrase was used in the Season one Spongebob Episode "Pickles". [1] Bubble Bass gives Spongebob a tricky order, which Spongbob makes. However, Bubble Bass says there are o pickles on his Krabby Patty, so he asks Spongebob's boss, Mr. Krabs for a refund. It is later revealed by Spongebob that Bubble Bass was Really hiding the pickles under his tongue the whole time. The first known instance of the phrase originates from the Reddit subreddit /r/aww. An image was uploaded of a small bat being touched by a finger with the title "No! Stop touching me! I AM THE NIGHT!"[1] on 10 Sep 2012. The image gained 2,126 points (96% upvoted) and 256 comments. In 2007, DeviantArt user Zapinc [1] uploaded a image saying, as well as titled "Do not fist Android girls"[2] The image gained over 139 comments. In 1994, the Entertainment Software Rating Board was created in 1994 as a response to criticisms about the violent and overtly sexualized content of some video games. [1]. The rating system's purpose was to in provide age guidelines for Console and Computer games in North America. While the ESRB is a self-regulatory organization, many consoles will not license games without a ESRB rating. Similarly, many retail outlets will not sell games without an ESRB rating. The rating comes in six varieties: Early Childhood (EC), Everyone (E), Everyone 10+ (E10+), Teen (T), Mature (M), and Adults Only (AO), as well as "Rating Pending" for when the rating has yet to be given. In addition the ESRB usually summarizes why the game was given the rating in a short sentence next to the letter grade.[4] The quote was originally said by the character of Harvey Dent (portrayed by Aaron Eckhart), the District Attorney of Gotham City who eventually takes on the role of the super-villain "Two Face," in the second film of Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight trilogy released on July 14th, 2008. In the film, Dent utters the line during his first face-to-face encounter with Bruce Wayne (portrayed by Christian Bale) at a restaurant, which serves as a foreshadowing to his own fate of turning into a tragic hero. In the final scene of the film, the line is emphatically reiterated by Bruce Wayne as Batman in a conversation with James Gordon (portrayed by Gary Oldman). You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain. I can do those things because I'm not a hero, like Dent. I killed those people. That's what I can be. In the 2001 film Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, Gandalf remarks that he has "no memory of this place" while passing through the Mines of Moria (shown below). On November 30th, 2011, Redditor jonatfuckdotorg posted a 3-pane image macro of the scene with the caption "I have no memory of this place" in a post titled "Back in the office the morning after the holiday break" (shown below). Prior to being archived, the post gained over 1,500 votes (95% upvoted) and 70 comments on the /r/funny[1] subreddit. In April 2015, a screenshot of a Kik conversation began circulating on 4chan and other image boards,[8] featuring a chat initiated by a role player identifying himself as "Drath'nor, the anus destroyer." After Drath'nor attempts to engage in cyber sex, the Kik user aggressively responds with several homophobic slurs, to which the Drath'nor replies "..screamed the stable boy" (shown below). The Gate of Babylon is the noble phantasm of the character Gilgamesh that was first introduced in the 2004 visual novel Fate/stay night. It is a key that opens a dimensional gate which leads towards Gilgamesh's personal treasury containing all of the legendary weapons known throughout history. Once activated, Gilgamesh can summon all of these weapons from his treasury and used them as projectiles to defeat his enemies. Gilgamesh first appeared as a character in the 2004 visual novel Fate/stay night as one of the main antagonists. He later appeared in the anime adaptations of Fate/stay night (2005) and Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works (2010), as well as ufotable's renditions of Fate/Zero (2011-2012) and Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works (2014-2015). On May 14th, 2007, niconico user コメントを禁止されています uploaded a compilation of various clips featuring Gilgamesh with a live rendition of the song "The Ecstasy of Gold" playing in the background (shown below). On March 24th, 2011, YouTuber Jim VanBlarium uploaded a segment of the episode "You On Kazoo" from the 1989 children's show Special Friends,[2] in which a young boy and other children play the kazoo.[1] On August 25th, 2014, the Dead VCR YouTube channel uploaded an edited version of the episode (shown below). Within two years, the video gained over 500,000 views and 2,200 comments. work in progress Request: If you know which anime, notable or not, had the first actual stereotypical beach episode in existence, that would be an awesome addition to have on the entry! The earliest known example of a beach episode in anime would have to be the 22nd episode of the original 1963 Astro Boy anime[1]. Gainax seems to have popularized this trope as some of their early shows having a beach episode/s (somewhat), the first ones appearing in episode 12 and 23 of Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water[2] and the ending of The End of Evangelion (which could also be considered a beach episode)[3]. Sailor Moon's 20th episode for its first season of the original series also had a beach episode[4]. The online usage of its acronym WTF can be traced to Usenet newsgroups in the 1980s, with the earliest iteration in a discussion thread about The Grateful Dead, which was posted via net.music.gdead by Dick Dunn on October 31st, 1985: BUT, can anyone shed even a little light on the lyrics of China Cat Sunflower? I've READ them; I know what all the words are. I still say, "WTF, over?" Someone's playing with our heads on this one, but what's all the word stew?  On March 23rd, 2015, Colletti uploaded a Vine of himself yelling “ayy dude!” in a phone conversation with Petulla, who then responds to his greeting with “suh dude" (pronounced suh-dew), a casual way of saying "sup dude," which in itself is a shorthand form of the expression "what's up, dude?" (shown below). On November 13th, Colletti uploaded a Vine of himself saying the phrase "suh dude" and making peace signs at the camera (shown below, left). The same day, Petulla posted several clips of himself saying "suh dude" to Vine (shown below, right). The trope Record Scratch Freeze Frame can be found in many movies, and is all-around a well known cliché. On December 19, 2010, "Robot Chicken: Star Wars Episode III" aired, with the opening sketch having the first known instance of Record Scratch Freeze Frame that was accompanied by the song "Baba O'Riley". In the sketch, Emperor Palpatine is thrown into the death star's reactor by Darth Vader, and as he falls, the film stops and he reminisces about his past. This, along with the opening scene of "Premium Rush" (2012) popularized the use of the song in memes later on. The first online occurrence is most likely 4chan around 2015: On June 13th, 2015, a /tv/ [1] (television and film) board user posted a mock film introductory sequence in which a record scratches, the frame freezes and a character begin discussing how they "got here" (shown below). On January 19th, 2016, Twitter user @cbanks420lol posted a picture of a crucified Jesus Christ captioned with the "Yup, that's me…" joke (shown below). In the next week, other Twitter users posted similar tweets. This is most likely separate from the referenced 4chan threads. On November 13th, 2016, Twitter user @freezeframebot posted the earliest usage of the "Yup, that's me." Baba O'Riley sound effect (shown below). The user himself claims he made the original .wav sound used in the memes. The sound effect soon spread to other platforms, including YouTube and Vine. freeze frame pic.twitter.com/Y6bZjwuVKE — Freeze Frame Bot (@freezeframebot) November 14, 2016 The now defunct channel Mumkey Jones made a video sometime in 2018 titled "Munkey Jones Stops A School Shooting", with the phrase "Yup, that's me etc." appearing several times from different characters, with different explanations on how they got into the situation, also using the song. This is the origin of a separate audio clip that was also used in memes. (Re-upload shown below) On November 10th, 2015, Fallout 4 was released for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Microsoft Windows platforms. One of the first NPCs encountered by the player is Preston Garvey of the Minutemen, who subsequently provides an endless supply of quests for the player to complete. When a new quest is available, Garvey will alert the player that a settlement requires assistance. The meme was born in late 2008 when an administrator of the Finnish gaming forum Jonneweb[7] posted several links redirecting to the Finnish imageboard Kuvalauta. Due to Jonneweb's reputation as an online hub for (pre)teenagers, some members of Kuvalauta became concerned that the imageboard would be overrun with unoriginal content by an influx of newcomers, a phenomenon commonly known as "newfaggotry" on the English-speaking web. The Jonneweb administrator referred to Kuvalauta as a "forum where you discuss about fish and bears"[8] and thus the world-wide Pedo bear meme was considered to be posted particularly by Jonneweb users. The combination of pre-teenager Jonnes and the Pedo bear meme took a great evolution in 2009 when the users of Kuvalauta started to post ironically as Jonnes by capsing the text, representing as underage school kids and adding typoes on text[1]. On December 6th, 2009, a thread[2] with poorly drawn versions of Pedobear was posted onto Kuvalauta. The thread[2] struck a chord with the rest of the community and spawned a variety of drawings and photoshopped images based on the Pedobear character, which were meant to mock the unrefined sense of humor often associated with teenager on the Finnish web. The mutation progressed throughout the thread, with the character's name changing from "Pedobear" to "budro poar" and "pedros spora" before becoming known as "Spurdo Sparde." The scene was featured in Episode 3, Season 4 of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, "America's Next Top Paddy's Billboard Model Contest."[8] In the episode, Charlie and Sweet Dee attempt to forcefully stage a viral video in the style of the "Grape Lady" newscast as a way to promote Paddy's Pub by going out in public as their alter ego characters, "Green Man" and "Martina Martinez," during which Charlie derails from the original plan and throws a volleyball at Sweet Dee's face before running away from the scene (shown below). The episode originally aired on September 26th, 2008. One of the earliest known GIFs of the scene was submitted by Tumblr user IHeartFamke to the official Tumblr blog[1] of the TV show on October 17th, 2009 (shown below).  In September 2012, the restinpower Tumblr[1] blog posted a photoshopped composite image of Ron Paul, an anime character and a cosplayer with the caption "Ron Paul / Will Make Anime Real" (shown below). Over the next four years, the post gained over 9,200 notes. The hairstyle is featured in episode 3 of season 5 of the Friendship is Magic series, "Castle Sweet Castle", premiered April 11th, 2015.[1] Twilight Sparkle appears wearing it briefly during a scene in a bathhouse (shown below). The first still image of the scene to be uploaded to MLP image hosting site Derpibooru (below, left) was submitted April 11th, by user jspenguin.[4] Other images from the scene were uploaded on the same day.[5][6] Quiz Kid originates as a comic strip from the website PBFcomics.com,[1] by Nicholas Gurewitch[2]. Nicholas is also resposible for the Weeaboo[3] comic. The premise of the original comic is of a boy asking for the answer for "Question 5" by the smarter kid sitting behind him. The smart kid then hands out a note, and on it was a drawing of a penis, causing the first child to make an angry expression. The next panel is of the children getting their results back with the smarter kid scoring an "A", and the other kid flunking the quiz. The earliest known instance of the "woke" as slang for political or social awareness comes from an article in the New York Times magazine. On May 20th, 1962, the Times published a piece on white beatniks appropriating black culture by African-American novelist William Melvin Kelley entitled "If You're Woke, You Dig It." The article also included a cartoon with the phrase (shown below).[8] The weapon was introduced in an update to the game called "The Two Cities Update"[1], which added "Australium"[2] reskins of weapons to the the drop system of the Mann Vs. Machine game mode, which would reskin the weapons model in a golden finish. The only way to attain the weapons are participating in a pay-to-play mode called "Operation Two Cities". Finishing the operation grants the player a chance to win a rare "Australium" weapon, with an even rarer chance of winning a Golden Frying Pan. The Unicode Consortium, the international board that selects and approves new emoji from submissions, selected the Face with Tears of Joy for release in 2010 for version 6.0, released in Unicode standard.[3] This emoji set was adopted as the first emoji available standard for Apple's iOS and OS X. Like all emoji, the character was created from a suggestion sent in by a user. On January 12th, 2016, the original gameplay was uploaded, featuring pannenkoek2012 using a Tool Assisted Software to obtain the star "Watch for Rolling Rocks" from the level Hazy Maze Cave using "half" of a press of the A button (by keeping it pressed from before Mario enters the level). The video gained over 13,000 views in the following week (shown below, left). The same day, a narrated version was released, explaining in detail the exploits used in the run. The most notable of these exploits was the use of "parallel universes", faraway places where the game thinks Mario is standing in the level when he isn't, which can be accessed with enough momentum. The narrated version gained over 200,000 views in the following week. The pictures of Zac Efron were taken for the promotion of the 2007 Disney TV musical film High School Musical 2 in which the actor reprises the male lead role Troy Bolton. The original images can be found on the online catalog of movie stills MovieStillsDB.[1] Tweets using the pictures of Efron in combination with the phrase first began appearing in early October 2015, with the earliest known tweet posted by the @ColIegeStudent,[2] a novelty account build around the Advice Animal character Lazy College Senior, on October 2nd. The tweet combined the images with the phrase "When you're a college student and your parents ask where all your money went." As of January 17th, 2016, the Tweet has received over 15,000 retweets and 17,000 likes. When you're a college student and your parents ask where all your money went pic.twitter.com/7IU7DK3A3A — College Student (@ColIegeStudent) October 2, 2015 The earliest use of the hashtag can be found on several tweets from January 6th, 2016, when several female users started posting ways to "waste the time" of men. The same day, a thread reporting the hashtag was created by user madness on the sport and hip-hop forum The Coli.[2] On February 1st, 2014, Joel from Vinesauce streamed himself installing spyware, viruses and other malware on a Windows 7 machine. During the stream, Joel plays MIDI remixes for the 1999 trance techno song "Sandstorm" by Darude and the 2010 dubstep song "Scary Monsters" by Skrillex (shown below, left). On July 11th, 2015, Vinesauce Joel broadcast another stream titled "Windows 8 Destruction," in which he converts an MP3 of wrestler John Cena's theme song "My Time Is Now" into MIDI, resulting in a new audio file comprised of piano key sounds (shown below, right). The hashtag was coined on January 15th, 2015, immediately after the 2015 Oscar nominations were announced, by the blogger April Reign.[1] Reign called for a boycott of the ceremony by those who cared about the fact that, besides a best picture nod for the Martin Luther King, Jr biopic Selma and a best director nomination for Alexander Iñarritu, there were no people of color in nominated in any of the major categories.[2] In an interview with MTV about the hashtag's necessity, Reign said,[3] "It’s not because there’s a lack of quality films that star or feature people of color; that’s not the issue. There was an article in The Atlantic recently which indicated who the Oscar voters are. They are 94 percent white, 76 percent male, and the average age is 63 years old … and they might not be as interested in seeing ’Selma." The first known online instance of CD flipping can be traced back to an animated GIF uploaded by Imgur user ArunisCharo in a post titled "You Won't Believe This One Simple Trick – Opticians Hate Him!"[2] on November 1st, 2015 (shown below). That same day, the GIF was submitted to Reddit's /r/funny[1], where it garnered more than 4,500 points and 200 comments prior to its archival. On October 25th, 2014, animator Jake Clark posted the original comic to his Tumblr blog,[1] depicting a visibly shaken character wiping sweat from his brow while struggling to choose between two buttons labeled "BE A DICK" and "DON'T BE A DICK" (shown below). Clark has since noted the comic was inspired by the Sweating Towel Guy illustration and the character Hank Nova from Timesplitters 2 [4]. In the next two years, the comic gained over 9,700 notes. The video was posted to YouTube[2] on Feb 20th, 2013 by the user Casketking00 in an attempt to create a "new internet fad", where he also posts a couple of examples of him "Breading" people. His mother was the first to get "Breaded", then he himself got "Breaded", and finally his dog. "In the End" was released as the fourth single on Linkin Park's first album Hybrid Theory[2], on October 9th, 2001. With much critical acclaim, the song reached number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100, and was the number one song of 2002 according to the rock radio station Z100. The music video has more than 147 million views on YouTube since its posting on YouTube on October 26th, 2009.[3] The earliest known image was an image edit of a WatchMojo video entitled "Top 10 Saddest Anime Deaths" with the still-shot of the video replaced with a shot of the CIA agent from Baneposting memes. The original iFunny post[6] (shown below), was created by user "Swagigan" on October 24th, 2015. The original short film by Watchmojo was posted Dec 4, 2014.[4] The video "Cortando o Botão do Youtube" was posted by the Brazilian YouTuber AruanFelix on December 22nd, 2015, ten minutes after a Twitter message sent by AruanFelix, saying (translated to English) that "The video will have a ten seconds delay, but I think it'll be worth it. What do you guys think?". The Twitter message showed an image of the YouTuber looking to the camera, pointing a wooden stick to the YouTube Silver Button (the same image used as the icon for the entry). The origin of this meme is unknown, although it follows the format of several previously determined comparison memes, like Expectation vs. Reality and What I watched / What I expected / What I got. The Name Brand vs. Great Value mutation began appearing in posts as early as May 2015.[1] Great Value is a specific reference to a brand of generic goods carried at Walmart, which is the tier two, or "National Brand Equivalent" of Walmart's generics.[2] Many online, in forums like Reddit and Yahoo Answers, question if the Great Value brand is of equal quality to name brands. While "The Dab" trend is generally believed to have originated from Atlanta, Georgia's hip-hop scene sometime during the first half of 2015[1], the question of who invented the dance move remains in dispute among several Atlanta-based hip hop artists and collectives, many of whom are affiliated with the record label Quality Control Music, including Migos, OG Maco, Skippa Da Flippa and Rich The Kid. According to Migos' member Quavo, the dance has been gaining traction in Atlanta's local hip-hop scene since as early as 2013, although it didn't reach the tipping point on Internet hip hop communities until the local rappers began releasing songs and music videos that either feature the dance or lyrical references to The Dab during the summer of 2015, most notably Skippa Da Flippa's “How Fast Can You Count It" and Migos' "Look at My Dab" (shown below). The song was released amidst the growing public interest in spaceflight and exploration, not long after the box office release of Stanley Kubrick's film adaptation of Arthur C. Clarke's 2001: A Space Odyssey and only five days prior to the launch of the United States' Apollo 11 mission. "Space Oddity" was extremely well received by the fans and critics alike, with the song becoming Bowie's first UK Top 5 hit single and eventually his first UK No. 1 single upon its re-release in 1973.[1] Pumpkin fell out of a tree in the backyard of Rosie Kemp of the Bahamas in October 2014 as a baby. The local animal shelter would not take the raccoon, so Kemp and her daughter, Laura Young, began caring for the raccoon themselves in their home.[2] On December 30th, 2014, Young began posting on Instagram a photo diary of caring for Pumpkin, who immediately befriended her dogs, Toffee and Oreo. This first photo has received 6,498 likes as of January 12th, 2016.[1] On April 2nd, 2007, Urban Dictionary[3] user Jamie Douglas submitted an entry for the term "sportsgasm," defining it as "when the sheer volume and quality of live sport induces a feeling not dissimilar to an orgasm in you." It is unknown where Sonic the Hedgehog and Christianity were first combined. Based on several factors, however, it can be assumed that the "genre" of Christian Sonic Fanart likely originated from the United States, which notably has both a large Christian population, especially in more Southern states, as well as a large Sonic fanbase. The earliest Christian Sonic Fanart was published online on DeviantArt in October 2006 as part of the founding of the Mobian Ministry, a DeviantArt group which has over 120 members.[1] The original comic was first posted by a Bulgarian user on 4chan's international board /int/ on September 11, 2014,[1] in order to mock Turkish /int/ shitposters. The comic features a Turkish father asking his son Mehmet if he would choose a Turkish or a Balkan woman to marry, after which Mehmet chooses the Balkan. It concludes with a fabricated screencap of a Turk arguing that Balkans are gypsies and therefore less white than Turks. The original poster later elaborated on the pattern of shitposting that had prompted the creation of the comic. Khajiit are one out of ten playable races in the series, first appearing in the first series entry, Arena in 1994, althought the Khajiit sub-species seen in that game are not very cat-like compared to later entries. The Elder Scrolls Wiki and series lore confims that there are many different subspecies of Khajiit, and the ones we see are merely the most widespread bipedal variety. The rapper Plies released the song "Ritz Carlton" as part of his "Ain't No Mixtape Bih 2" mixtape in fall of 2015; the video was uploaded as a WorldStarHipHop exclusive on November 19th, 2015.[1] In the song, Plies says the lyric "run off on the plug twice." A plug is generally defined by Urban Dictionary as someone from whom one would purchase drugs;[2] Plies appears to be bragging about not paying for drugs from the same person twice. Plies then says that he won't be accepting calls from the plug.[3] The song was featured on Drake's OVO Sound Radio Episode 14 for Apple Music. The World Star exclusive video received 6 million views in the first 4 months. The origin of the drawing is unknown, but it began showing up on forums like Funnyjunk[1] and Reddit[2] in October of 2015. The earliest instance of the image was in English, and was meant as an ironic jab at social justice warriors. On January 1st, 2016, the Manchester Evening News in Manchester, England published a photo slideshow documenting the party atmosphere and urban celebrations surrounding the New Year of 2016, titled "New Years Eve 2016 – party, party, party."[1] The slideshow featured 31 photographs by Evening News photographer Joel Goodman, many of which depicted Manchester residents in various states of intoxication. The 20th image in the slideshow was captioned "Police hold on to a man while another lies in the road."[1] Tell that to Kanjiklub, refers to a line said from character Bala-tik in the sci-fi space opera film Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens who confronts Han Solo and Chewbacca about paying his dues that he owes them. After stating that Han Solo also made a deal with the notorious gang "Kanjiklub", Han Solo denies this, with Bala-tik saying "Tell that to Kanjiklub." On January 3rd, 2016, Redditor ThreadlessJon submitted a picture of Fred eating a hamburger in the Spongebob Squarepants episode "Jellyfish Hunter" with the caption "When you're at a party and someone says they are the best at Smash" (shown below). Within nine days, the post gained over 6,900 votes (94% upvoted) and 370 comments on the /r/me_irl[1] subreddit.  The Japanese-English hybrid phrase "you make my kokoro go doki doki," with kokoro meaning "heart" and doki doki being the onomatopoeic word for the sound of a heartbeat in Japanese, is believed to have been coined by members of the English-speaking online communities devoted to manga and anime fandoms. The earliest known use of the expression can be found in the title of an original comic drawing submitted by DeviantART user SunshinexKite[4] on January 15th, 2012. That same day, Yahoo Answers user ThatOneUnicorn submitted a post[1] inquiring the meaning of the phrase. Rebecca began drawing Aircraft Carrier Kaga and the commonly paired Aircraft Carrier Akgai in 2013 [2]. Initially starting with comics, Rebecca later started to draw more macros. The phrase "sleep" refers to Kaga's in game lines, some of which mention that she is sleepy [3] The phrase is believed to have been coined on 4chan's /pol/ (politically incorrect) board sometime around late 2015 by users who began assuming an increasingly skeptical and critical stance towards the new wave of African American civil rights protests surrounding a series of racially charged police brutality controversies, most notably the #blacklivesmatter movement and civil unrest in Baltimore. On December 1st, 2016, the Economist, a political and financial magazine, released their annual book, which contains their predictions and explorations of world issues in the new year.[2] The cover featured a series of portraits of world leaders arranged in the foreground, with other figures arranged in the background. Second from right, in the first row, was Russian President Vladimir Putin. In early January, 2016, Petro Poroshenko, the President of the Ukraine allegedly tweeted a photo of a photoshopped copy of the book in which his face had been photoshopped to replace Putin's, and the year had been changed to 2017. The accompanying text read "Some of the gifts are not perceived as a compliment, but as a personal responsibility." The tweet was later deleted.[2] On May 17, 2010, Greg Leuch from the Free Art & Technology released the “Shaved Bieber"[1] web browser extension, which blacks out any mentions of Justin Bieber along with any pictures of the pop star. In late December 2015, Australia's Got Talent released a promotional video for the 2016 season of the show, featuring a man making exaggerated facial expressions while watching an unknown performance (shown below). On December 16th, 2015, Hungarian artist Gergely Dudás[9] (also known as Dudolf) shared an illustrated puzzle in which a panda bear is inconspicuously camouflaged in a crowd of homogenous snowmen on Facebook, challenging the viewers to locate the hidden panda (shown below). Within the first week, the illustration went viral on Facebook after garnering more than 400,000 likes and 60,000 shares, subsequently getting picked up by several viral media blogs and news sites like BuzzFeed, The Huffington Post and The Independent. By the end of the second week, Dudás' post had garnered more than 109,000 likes,183,255 shares and 37,000 comments. On December 28th, 2015, the Utopian Raspberry – Modern Oasis Machine Facebook[1] page posted two illustrations of a dog wearing pants with the caption "If a dog wore pants would he wear them like this or like this?" (shown below). Within 48 hours, the post gained over 4,800 shares, 1,500 likes and 400 comments. The still frame used in examples of the meme are taken from episode 7 of season 5 of the Friendship is Magic series, "Make New Friends But Keep Discord",[3] as seen at roughly 0:14 in the video below. The first submission of the meme to the MLP image hosting site Derpibooru was of a short GIF of the original scene,[1] including Fluttershy making the face. The image was submitted on May 16th, 2015, the same day that the episode aired. "Ocean Man" was released on June 24th, 1997 by Ween as the second single from their sixth studio album album, The Mollusk. It was praised by AllMusic as an example of how Ween's "array of silly jokes and musical parody is richer and more diverse than most of its alternative rock contemporaries"[3] along with serving as a creative inspiration for Spongebob Squarepants creator Stephen Hillenburg in creating the show.[1] On November 9th, 2010, Laren published the illustration on Blogspot[1] and subsequently posted to Laren's Tumblr[2] and Flickr[3] (shown below). On March 2nd, 2014, Redditor aaduk_ala submitted a photograph titled "Trying to hold a fart next to a cute girl in class" to the /r/funny[1] subreddit (shown below). Prior to being archived, the post gained over 2,500 votes (88% upvoted) and 500 comments. In the film, Kylo Ren is played by Adam Driver, most well-known for his previous role in the television show Girls as an angsty, millennial love interest of the main character. In addition, the character wears all black and has long hair that can be compared to the style of hair worn by those in the emo subculture.[2] The character of Emo Kylo Ren was created using the account name @KyloR3n; the account's first tweet was posted on December 21st, 2015 and by December 28th had received over 1,100 retweets and 3,000 likes.[1] On Dec 21st, 2015 a Hillary Clinton campaign staffer named Paola Luisi published the article "7 things Hillary Clinton has in common with your abuela,"[1] which talked about the ways that Clinton, who had just heard the news that she was going to become a grandmother for the second time, was just like an ordinary grandmother. The post, which used the Spanish word for grandmother in the title and other Spanish terms sprinkled throughout, was originally called "8 Ways Hillary Clinton Is Like Your Abuela" according to the URL, but at some point the list was shortened to seven. Some of the reasons included GIFs or quotes from Clinton's Twitter profile. The following day, the MicNews reporter Matthew Rodriguez tweeted "Hillary Clinton is #NotMyAbuela." The tweet received 246 retweets and 340 likes as of December 28th, 2015.[2] The phrase was first mentioned in the 14th episode of the 2nd season of the show, titled "City of Walls and Secrets".[1] Jet, a drifter and acquaintance of the protagonists, engaged in a brawl in a tea shop, which prompted him to be captured by the corrupt, clandestine Ba Sing Se city officials. Jet's unruly behavior disrupts the artificially designed peace within the city walls and thus was subdued to brainwash in the sunken chambers of the city's lake, where a hypnotic lamp revolved around the restricted drifter as an agent continuously repeats, "There is no war in Ba Sing Se". On December 1st, 2015, the avatar image of Hillary Clinton's official Twitter account was updated with a custom-designed version of the original campaign logo featuring a cartoonified figure of Rosa Parks, the renowned African-American Civil Rights activist, sitting on an H-shaped bus seat (shown below, right). While the custom avatar was intended to commemorate the 60th anniversary of Rosa Parks Day, the day on which the Alabama resident was arrested for refusing to obey the state's bus segregation laws, it was quickly met by backlash on the social media, particularly from Black Twitter, where it was perceived as insensitive cultural appropriation of the African-American heritage and Civil Rights Movement. While the exact origin of "TIL" as the three-letter acronym for "today I learned…" remains unclear, the phrase itself most likely began seeping into everyday online vernacular through its usage on social news aggregation sites Reddit and Digg sometime in April 2007, according to Google Trends. On December 28th, 2008, Redditor nix0n created /r/TIL[1], a subreddit where community members are encouraged to spontaneously share "interesting and specific facts" that they had just found out about, in contrast to general knowledge that they had intently looked up.   The edits are based around the boss Photoshop Flowey, who appears at the end of the neutral ending of Undertale. He is displayed as a television set with human-like eyes and teeth and two large plant-like arms. His design was noted by fans for having a stark style contrast to the rest of the game, as instead of the normal pixelated appearance in his basic form, he is a collage of images, which was co-made by Everdraed. A false flag is a military operation originated by the navy, where a boat would fly the flag of another country when completing an operation, in order to fool onlookers into believing that the action was being committed by the other country. False flag operations have been pretexts for declarations of war on many occasions, including during World War II, when a false flag attack on German forces by Germany convinced the German state to attack and eventually take over Poland, and the Second Sino-Japanese War, when a Japanese detonation of a Mongolian railway was used as a pretext to attack Manchuria.[1] False flag conspiracies first gained traction online among members of the 9/11 Truth Movement, some of whom believed that the attacks on the World Trade Center were perpetrated by the American government as a way to gain public support for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2003, the web site 9/11 review published "A History of False Flag Operations,"[2] listing The War on Terror, saying: "War on Terror: The war was launched by Bush administration October 2001. The war was claimed to be the response on terrorism, especially the 9-11 incidents. Most of the people in the world today know that these reasons are false and that those events were based on MIH type (make it happen) inside job." In the film The Force Awakens a riot control stormtrooper confronts main character Finn, calls him a traitor, and duels Finn with lightsaber-resistant melee weaponry called a Z6 baton. The trooper seemingly defeats Finn before being shot and killed by Han Solo a few moments later. In the official prequel book Before The Awakening it is revealed that the Stormtrooper's name was FN-2199, nicknamed "Nines". The Riot Stormtrooper trained with Finn, explaining why he singled out and attacked him in such and aggressive manner. The "feasting" webcasts first came about in 2008 with AfreecaTV vlogger Tae-Hyun's Muck-Show (Eating Show), a livecast talk show-style program wherein he hangs with his friends over a barbecue on camera. In the following years, Tae-Hyun and his eat-and-show set-up became quite popular within the AfreecaTV community, giving rise to bloggers on the site, most notably Wang-Jew, who has been credited with establishing eating shows (muk-shows) as a mainstream vlog genre. On April 12th, 2015, Redditor Moridakkubokka posted the image of Jazz Cat in front of a plate of blinis to r/cats[1] (shown below). The image received over 7,100 points (94% upvoted) in four years. On December 20th, 2015, the 64th annual Miss Universe pageant was held at the AXIS Theater in Las Vegas, Nevada, hosted by American comedian and TV host Steve Harvey. As the announcement of the final results approached towards the end of the nationally televised event, Harvey erroneously named the first runner-up, Ariadna Gutiérrez (Miss Colombia), as the winner of the pageant. However, a few minutes after Gutiérrez was crowned, Harvey returned to the stage to reveal that he had read the results incorrectly and named Pia Wurtzbach (Miss Philippines) as the winner of the pageant (shown below). As the confused audience began jeering at Harvey's announcement mix-up, the host immediately claimed full responsibility for his mistakes and displayed the content of the card on-screen to clear any doubts over the winner of the pageant. On May 8th, 2010, a single topic blog on Tumblr called Animated Albums created and posted three endless GIF loops of popular albums, including David Bowie's Low, Blondie's Parallel Lines, and Grace Jones' Nightclubbing. Of the three, the Blondie received the most notes, with 750. Animated Albums continued to publish animated cover GIFs through 2013. On May 1st, 1999, the Spongebob Squarepants episode "Tea at the Treedome" was broadcast, in which Spongebob attempts to woo an air-breathing squirrel named Sandy. While becoming increasingly thirsty while sitting in Sandy's treedome, Spongebob attempts to resist drinking a glass of watching but telling himself "I don't need it", before finally giving in and yelling "I need it!" (shown below).  The character Mettaton is presented as a flamboyant robot who is programmed to be a killing machine and entertainer, starring in multiple television shows. Mettaton is characterized for his fascination for his legs and incorporating them into his attacks.  Right after the raid, A reddit user named /u/doesitmakesound created a poll on reddit /r/4chan to decide which design was the best, and more than 1000 redditors answered it, which motivated this same user into building a real website, called ShirtWasCash, in reference to the meme Shit Was So Cash , to produce and sell those t-shirts. Pretty quick, the joke wasn't a joke anymore, as /u/doesitmakesound made a colossal amount of money from this prank (He made $40k in sales selling the t-shirts before the end of the 30 days free trial of the e-commerce platform he was using). This will be remembered as the day 4chan users decided to do something from their creativity, and as the day a smart kid took the opportunity from it. On December 15th, 2015, Instagram user masipopal[1] posted six photographs of Johnson in which he appears to be buttoning the cuff of his shirt along with the caption "Will the rock ever finish buttoning his sleeve? We'lll never know" (shown below). Within one week, the post gained over 29,000 likes and 3,200 comments. In late 2013, Valve introduced a user ratings and review system on Steam, allowing users to rate and write reviews of any video game titles they have purchased on their product pages. Within the first fe weeks, multiple satirical reviews were written for universally-panned titles, including Bad Rats[11](shown below, left) and Infestation: Survivor Stories[12] (shown below, right). The term "cummies" has been used in a variety of different communities (mostly BDSM related) to refer to semen. One of the earliest known uses was in a post to a cuckold dedicated Tumblr blog from a user identifying themselves as "missy", on September 22nd, 2013.[1] The earliest known use of the phrase in reference to a DDLG relationship was in a post by Tumblr user littlemermaidvirginprincess on or shortly before December 31st, 2013 (shown below).[2] Vault Boy has appeared since the first Fallout game in 1997 as the mascot for Vault-Tec, a corporation made to design and build bomb shelters known as Vaults. Appearing in advertisements, short films and guides. The character was originally designed by Leonard Boyarsky, and created specifically to emulate "Uncle Moneybags" from the board game Monopoly. The character was later drawn for Fallout by a variety of artists, including George Almond, Tramell Ray Isaac, Brian Menze, Natalia Smirnova, and Ed Orman.[1] Vault Boy appears in the game as a winking presence on the players' stats boards, and also in commercials and advertisements for Vault-Tec. On May 2nd, 2010, Season 5 Episode 10 of the Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! aired on the Adult Swim network. During a sketch in the episode, actor Paul Rudd approaches his computer in a what appears to be a virtual reality environment and orders the machine to display various animations of himself dancing, including programs named "Celery Man," "Oyster," "Tayne" and "Mozza-Rell." On August 23rd, 2012, YouTuber storiedvirus8's channel uploaded the sketch (shown below). On December 6th, 2015, Twitter users began posting embarrassing photographs of themselves, followed by a stock photograph of an "upgrade" keyboard key and another photograph in which they appear attractive and well-groomed (shown below).  In A Very Brady Movie, the character Jan lies about having a boyfriend named George Glass, to which her sister Marcia replies "I've never heard of a George Glass at our school" (shown below). The scene is an homage to The Brady Bunch episode "The Not-So-Ugly Duckling," originally aired on November 20th, 1970. Jan: "No I mean Glass, George Glass." Marcia: "That's funny. I've never heard of a George Glass at our school. Jan: "That's because he's a transfer student. He came in the last week of school. He's really good looking and he thinks I'm super cool." Marcia: "Sure, Jan." The design originated in 1775 as one of the flags used by the American navy during its revolutionary war against the British Empire. The use of the snake as a symbol and metaphor was already popular at the time; an early example was a political cartoon, "Join, or Die",[2] created in the 1750s by Benjamin Franklin during the Seven Years' War (shown below). The cartoon featured the various states of the American colonies represented by the dismembered sections of a snake. The original design was likely first used by the Marines of the newly formed American navy, though the precise origin is unknown.[1] Colonel Christopher Gadsden, after whom the flag is named, saw the design and was so impressed by it that he ordered an official flag to be created with it.[3] In the 1975 film Monty Python and the Holy Grail, the discussion of the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow takes place twice in the film.[1] In the first scene, King Arthur asks a castle guard if he may be let in, since he has been riding all day to get there. The guard points out that he has not been riding, as his horse consists purely of the sound of two coconuts being clicked together, and a discussion of where the coconuts could have been obtained follows. During this discussion, King Arthur suggests that they could have been brought to England via a migrating swallow, and the castle guards continue to discuss the probability of this suggestion at length, becoming more and more technical in their debate. King Arthur becomes annoyed and rides away. Later in the film, Arthur is trying to bypass a troll who asks him "What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?" Arthur, informed by the earlier debate, asks "What do you mean? African or European swallow?" Since the troll cannot answer this question, he is defeated. On June 17th, 2015, Japanese comedian Masahiro Ehara tweeted several photographs in which he is shown squishing his children's faces into a triangle (shown below).[1] Within six months, the tweets gained over 70,000 retweets combined.  On December 4th, in the Leytonstone Station of the London Underground, a video was recorded of a crazed man attempting to stab bystanders while yelling Allahu Akbar. As the man is detained by police, a bystander yells "You ain't no Muslim, Bruv," a reference to the man's violent actions (violence is condemned in most Koranic interpretations) combined with the British slang for brother, similarly used to the American slang bro. The bystander repeats the phrase twice more in the video. On December 8th, 2015, Donald Trump called into the MSNBC show Morning Joe the day after making controversial statements about banning all Muslim people from America during a speech. During that interview, Trump claimed that there were sections of London so radicalized by ISIS / Daesh that local police officers were afraid to go there.[1] After the video was placed online, many in Britain contested the point and began posting other "facts" in the style of the exaggeration they believed was being made under the already existing hashtag #TrumpFacts.[2] On December 6th, 2015, Imgur[1] user FreshPrinceofDenmark posted a series of Facebook screenshots in which a user named Robert Graves mocks various people in status update posts. One screenshot contained a post by user Brendan Sullivan, who gave the film Fight Club a rating of "5/7" (shown below). The gallery contained an additional screenshot in which Graves mocks the 5/7 rating by suggesting that Sullivan actually means "a week" when saying "five days" (shown below). In the first 48 hours, the post gained over 463,000 views, 24,900 points and 1,100 comments. On September 21st, 1937, the fantasy novel and children's book The Hobbit, or There and Back Again was released. In the book, the character Gollum is introduced as a disfigured creature who inhabits a small island in an underground lake. The character is obsessed with a magical ring he refers to as "my precious," which is discovered by the character Bilbo Baggins. In The Lord of the Rings, it is revealed that Gollum was previously a Hobbit named Sméagol, who had been twisted by the influence of the ring. On April 4th, 2010, Urban Dictionary[1] user tankedgirl submitted an entry for "beetlejuiced," defining it as a phenomenon that occurs when a person appears after they have been mentioned several times in conversation. The earliest known use of the term "beetlejuicing" in the context of a discussion thread conversation was posted in the /r/AskReddit[4] subreddit on January 13th, 2013. In the thread, Redditor bigfrank84 replied to a comment containing the name "Big Frank," to which Redditor tynosaur responded "One of the best instances of Beetlejuicing I've ever seen" (shown below). On January 10th, 2011, Beast was born in the care of a Puli Hungarian sheep dog breeder in Grants Pass, Oregon and was subsequently purchased by Zuckerberg and Chan. On March 6th, a Facebook[1] page for Beast was launched, which gained over 2.2 million likes in the following five years. In June 1998, psychiatrist and Munchausen expert Marc Feldman issued a three'page article in the Western Journal of Medicine[1] dealing with the Munchausen By Proxy disorder while also highlighting behavioral patterns that he referred to as "Virtual Factitious Disorder", noting that the emerging popularity of the Internet, gaining traction in the mid to late 1990s, may have helped spreading a new form of Munchausen's Syndrome in online communities. As he wrote (excerpt): Feldman later coined the term "Munchausen By Internet" in a July 2000 publication for the Southern Medical Journal[2]. This phrase comes from an old eighties advertisement, released by French railway company SNCF to promote a new reduction card called "Kiwi", allowing a child under 16 to travel with four people for half the price. On November 21st, 2015, meteorologist Jennifer Myers from the Fox 4 News television station in Dallas, Texas posted a collage of female meteorologists wearing the same dress on Facebook,[1] claiming an Amazon[2] page for the garment had been posted to a private Facebook group for weather forecasters (shown below).

On February 14th, 2004, Urban Dictionary[1] user trickologist submitted an entry for "smh," defining it as an acronym for "shake my head" which is used in response to "something so stupid, no words can do it justice" (shown below). Over the next 11 years, the definition gained over 20,100 up votes and 10,400 down votes.  Shh Bby Is Ok originates from a story told in the subreddit /r/casualconversation.[1] In a post from November 29th, 2015, the user franklymydeer told a long story about falling in love with a song in a Seat Toca car commercial and becoming desperate to track it down. The user explained the extreme lengths they went to in order to track down the song, incuding writing to the public relations department of the auto company in order to inquire. When the public relations department told franklymydeer that the song was a short commission for the commercial, the user was heartbroken; however, almost an entire year later, another reddit user emailed franklymydeer and said the song was called "Turn the Lights Down" by an artist called BSO.[2] In the resulting conversation, the anonymous reddit user told franklymydeer "ssh bby is ok." According to Urban Dictionary[13], "U WOT" is the phonetic transcription of the interjectory "you what?" used as an angry retort to a bad news. Mate[12], when used as a noun, is a colloquial term mainly used in the United Kingdom and Australia as a friendly form of address among men, with its earliest documentation found in a Middle English manuscript named Sir Ferumbras dating to circa 1380. Its l33t-style shorthand form "M8" has been used in IRC channels and instant messaging since the 1990s. Its online use as a shorter way of saying mate was first noted via Urban Dictionary[5] in November 2002.  On May 22nd, 2014, Tumblr user woodmeat published a post with the message "she succ me thru my boxers."[2] Within two years, the post gained over 11,000 notes. Soon after, Tumblr user Shagia uploaded an image of the Feels Guy with the caption of "she succ me thru my feel …." (shown below, right).[1] On November 24th, 2015, Redditor TheLetter10 submitted a photograph of Yankovic standing in line at an airport security station to the /r/pics[4] subreddit, where it gathered upwards of 5,400 votes ( 92% upvoted) within 24 hours (shown below, left). In the comments section of the post, Redditor teh_newguy[5] posted an edited version of the Sad Keanu photograph with Yankovic superimposed over Keanu Reeves (shown below, right). The original video was uploaded on July 23, 2015 by Youtube user Joe, a.k.a. Unklejoe, who is the creator of the web animation compilation show Great: The Show.[1] The Dog of Wisdom clip was originally part of Episode 7, but was uploaded independently as well.[2] In a span of 4 months, the video gained over 3,700,000 views. On November 13th, 2015, the French and Belgian authorities launched massive police raids in search of several suspects in the Paris terror attacks still believed to be at large, including Salah Abdeslam[1], a 26-years-old Belgian-born French national who rented a car and drove the attackers to the Bataclan theatre on the night of the attacks. By November 16th, the French investigators and European news outlets[2][3][4] had identified Abdeslam as a key suspect and the only perpetrator presumed to be still living and hiding in Brussels. On November 21st, the Belgian government raised its terrorist threat alert to the maximum level after determining that another major attack was being planned in Brussels, which effectively placed the city under lockdown. On November 22nd, as the Belgian police conducted counter-terrorism raids across the city, Belgian Defence Minister Steven Vandeput[5] tweeted: On May 19th, 1999, the film Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, in which Binks is introduced as a clumsy alien humanoid from the planet Naboo, who is saved by Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn after being banished from his tribe. Binks went on to appear in the prequel films Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith, where he becomes a politician and famously delivers a speech to the Galactic Senate granting Chancellor Palpatine emergency powers. On November 23rd, 2015, an anonymous 4chan user submitted a post to the /b/ (random) board urging viewers to post comments that Drake had died in a car crash to his music videos on YouTube (shown below). ITT: We go to YouTube and tell them on Drakes video he died in a car crash. Like each others' comments. Dislike and report those that deny it and try to call bullshit. Dogmeat originally appeared in the first Fallout game. He was located in Junktown in the year 2161, where he was the companion of another NPC named Phil; the player could distract Phil and therefore gain Dogmeat as his own companion.[1] Dogmeat continued to appear in all of the Fallout games. In Fallout 3, he was integrated more into the gameplay, and his popularity as a character began to rise even more.[2] He appeared again in Fallout 4, by which time he had his own fandom and cult following.[3] Although the later versions of the game occur much later in time, the game's creators have maintained that the newer Dogmeat is a direct descendent of the older Dogmeat. The exact origin of the term is unclear. The earliest known definition was submitted on September 6th, 2005 to Urban Dictionary,[1] where user Spiel Brickner identified "bylat" as a Russian slang term for "whore" or "slut" that can also be used as a general-purpose expletive.  In 2008, Toby Fox released the EarthBound Halloween Hack,[1] a ROM hack of the SNES video game Earthbound.

One the original pre-internet celebrity death hoaxes was a rumor of Beatle Paul McCartney's death in 1966.[4] One of the first death hoaxes to spread online was the 2010 Morgan Freeman death hoax.On December 16th, 2010, Twitter user OriginalCJiZZle[6] tweeted a message asserting that actor Morgan Freeman had died, prefaced by an RT (retweet) signature credited to CNN to make it appear as if the news organization had tweeted the original report: CNN[8] quickly issued a response explaining that it had not reported on Freeman’s death via Twitter[5]: The same day, CNN[7] published an article titled “Who said Morgan Freeman is dead? Not us," in which the news outlet reiterated their previous response and included a confirmation from the actor's publicist Stan Rosenfield that Freeman was still alive. While the exact origin of the copypasta is unknown, it is rumored to have originated on 4chan according to the Meme Archives Tumblr blog.[2] On December 14th, 2008, the question was anonymous submitted to the online Q&A community Yahoo Answers,[6] marking the earliest archived instance of the copypasta.

On January 21st, Disqus user Linda Glocke wrote "I Will Destroy ISIS" in a comment to an article titled "Islamic State Group Threatens to Kill 2 Japanese Hostages" on ABC7.com, the website of ABC's affiliate channel based in Los Angeles. The article has since been removed from the website, but Glocke's original comment remains accessible through the archives of Disqus.[1] About an hour after Glocke's post, Redditor Jamesnufc took the earliest known screenshot of the comment and submitted it to the /r/me_irl subreddit (shown below)[2] as a commentary on the Charlie Hebdo Terror Attacks that had recently taken place in Paris, France. While the username in the screenshot was mildly blurred out in consideration of the commenter's privacy, it was nevertheless sufficiently legible that other viewers on Reddit soon managed to identify the commenter's name as "Linda Glocke." Redditor Jamesnufc's post accrued 4,304 points (99% upvoted) prior to being archived. The term "power level" was first used in Chapter 195 of the Dragon Ball manga, released on October 17th, 1988, when Raditz, after arriving on Earth, measures the power level of a farmer that was nearby[1]. Raditz uses a tool called a scouter to measure the power level, which is five.[2] According to Dragon Ball Wiki, The first and last power level read by a scouter in the manga is "5". The first time occurs when Raditz lands at Earth and uses his scouter to examine a hostile farmer to see if he is any threat to him. The last time occurs when King Cold's soldier Iru reads Future Trunks' power level as 5 (as Future Trunks was hiding his true level); this is the last time a Scouter appeared on the main series. Gondola first originated on the Ylilauta /int/ board by an Italian poster (named Scary Pizza) in a now-deleted post from summer of 2015.[1] It was meant to be a new and less aggressive version of Spurdo who doesn't speak Spurdish, or at all; a melancholic man that doesn't talk, but only observes the world. On the VK Spurdo page, the following character profile is listed (sic throughout):[2] Users of Twitter began posting the hashtag immediately after the attacks of November 13th.[1] It is unknown who the first tweeter was; however, the existence of a clothing line called "Pray For Paris", which pre-dates the attacks, means that it is possible that the hashtag already existed before the attacks.[2] In the 24 hours after the attacks, the hashtag reached a top rate of use of 64,000 tweets per minute, and was used more than 6 million times.[3] On the morning of November 18th, 2015, the French police raided an apartment in Saint-Denis, a town north of Paris, France, which allegedly sheltered several people linked to the November 13th terrorist attacks In Paris.The raid resulted in two people dead and eight more arrested. Before tenant Jawad Bendaoud was taken into police custody, he was briefly interviewed by a BFM TV News crew and claimed he had no knowledge he was harboring terrorists (shown below).[1] Transcript: On January 24th, 2010, the /r/ggggg[1] subreddit was launched, gaining over 16,700 subscribers over the next six years. According to Redditor thebigone200,[7] the subreddit was initially created for people to post messages in Morse code, with the uppercase "G" indicating a "da" signal and the lowercase "g" indicated a "dit" signal. Eventually, the subreddit abandoned the Morse code theme and became centered around humorous posts featuring creative uses of the letter. Crisis actors do actually exist, although as of November 2015, most of the websites once used to recruit and position them in military exercises have been taken offline.[1] According to Gawker, one military contractor responsible for the hiring of crisis actors is called Halo Corporation, but that company has almost no web presence.[2] Archive shots of the website CrisisActors.org, which has been offline since 2013 and many point to as a main source of these actors, claim the tagline: "Helping schools and first responders create realistic drills, full-scale exercises, high-fidelity simulations, and interactive 3D films."[3] It is unknown when the first crisis actor conspiracy theory was distributed, however the first popular speaking on the topic came from a blog called Memory Hole, where the author James Tracey claimed that the Sandy Hook Elementary School Shooting was a staged event, and that many of the students and their parents, especially the ones featured in news broadcasts, were actually hired crisis actors. Tracey claims that these actors appeared to have been coached to memorize lines and recite them on the news.[4] On July 29th, 2015, the Barnie Sandlers Facebook[1] page was launched, which received upwards of 19,700 likes in the following four months. The pages contain posts written from the perspective of a fictional politician, often accompanied by photographs and image macros of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. The same day, the @BarnieSandlers[2] novelty Twitter feed was created and the website BarnieSandlers.com[5] was launched with a "dank maymay" image macro generator (shown below). On July 22nd, 2012, YouTuber Tiggzyy uploaded a video titled "THE ORIGINAL SUFFERGRAM!!! – Heart Of A Coward – Shade," featuring video footage of a man knocking out a woman to the ground with a punch during a street brawl (shown below). The term "suffergram" can be seen as a portmanteau of the English verb "to suffer" and the noun suffix -gram denoting something written or recorded. [W.I.P] The exact origin of the phrase is unclear, but the earliest know use on 4chan was posted by a user accusing the OP of using being Paul Dano giving a "false name" (shown below). On October 26th, 2015, Trump appeared at a live town hall segment on the television show Today, where he answered questions from members of the audience.

"It has not been easy for me. It has not been easy for me. I started off in Brooklyn. My father gave me a small loan of a million dollars. I came into Manhattan, and I had to pay him back, and I had to pay him back with interest. But I came into Manhattan and I started buying properties, and I did great."

Although there is no clear date when the term "kink shaming" came into use, the first online mentions date from the Livejournal Kink communities, where some "no kink shaming" policies went into effect as early as 2008.[7] On October 6th, 2015, the Invasion Community Update was released for Team Fortress 2, which included a community-made Source Filmmaker video (shown below) and some new maps, one of which named "pd_watergate"[3]. On this map, players are tasked with collecting bottles of beer by killing enemy players and depositing them in a UFO by entering its tractor beam. Upon any player entering the beam, a text-to-speech-generated voice line is heard saying either "We are in the beam"[4] or "The enemy is in the beam"[5], depending on the team. The voice used is named "WillFromAfar", which is located on the site, Acapela Group[6]. The original video was uploaded by 3exclamationpoint on February 17th, 2011. Since then, the video has gained over 1.5 million views, becoming 3exclamationpint's most viewed video. In May 1998, Ben Carson, then a renowned neurosurgeon and the Director of Pediatric Neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital, made a public appearance as the keynote speaker for the graduation ceremony at Andrews University, the flagship university of the Seventh-day Adventist school system, in Berrien Springs, Michigan. During the commencement speech, Dr. Carson shared his "personal theory" about the nature of the Ancient Egyptian pyramids with the graduates in attendance, in which he asserted that the world-famous monolithic structures were built by the biblical figure Joseph to store grain, in contradiction to the leading theory that they were built as tombs for pharaohs as widely accepted by most archaeologists. “My own personal theory is that Joseph built the pyramids in order to store grain. Now all the archaeologists think that they were made for the pharaoh’s graves, but you know it’d have to be something awfully big, if you stop and think about it, and I don’t think it would just disappear over the course of time to store that much grain, and when you look at the way the pyramids are made, with many chambers that are hermetically sealed, they would have to be that way for a reason. And, you know, various scientists have said ‘well, you know, there were alien beings that came down; they had special knowledge,’ and that’s how they were – you know, doesn’t require an alien being when God is with you.” On October 17th, 2015, National Geographic[1] published a photograph of Bill Nye, taken by photographer Chris Cassel, walking down the middle of a road while smoking a cigarette (shown below). The picture was meant to illustrate Nye’s feelings of despair when confronted with evidence about climate change.

[1] The earliest appearance of the actual "Get dunked on!" quote on Internet is from a Snickers commercial featuring the basketball player Patrick Ewing, where he breaks a hoop and backboard on top of someone eating Snickers by dunking, and the quote is featured as a catchphrase at the end of the commercial. While it sparked interest around 2009, it seems to have died out. It is unknown if the more recent uses of the quote in League Of Legends and Undertale are related to this commercial.

In the story, the protagonist Zola discovers that Jess is also a prostitute, Jess' boyfriend has an emotional breakdown and her pimp commits homicide. I met this white bitch at Hooters, I was her waitress! She came in with this old ass big ass black dude, so you know as a Hooter’s girl we have to talk to our customers. I sit with them and we get to talking, she tells me she dances! So I’m like Oh yes bitch me too! Then she tells me this hulking black man is her Sugar Daddy.and I’m like oh yes bitch my Sugar Daddy at home. So we vibing over our hoeism or whatever and we exchange numbers! and I’m like “next time you dance hun I’ma come dance with you!” The next day I get a text like “BITCH LETS GO TO FLORIDA!” and I ‘m like huh? She’s like “I’m going to dance in Florida, let’s go!” Now I’m skeptical like DAMN bitch we just met and we already taking hoe trips together? but I had went to Florida two months prior and made 15K so lowkey I was down. So I was like “okay I’ll go, who’s all going and when we leaving.” All this bitch says is “be ready by 8” So I call her like “bitch I SAID who’s all going!” and she says “my boyfriend and our room-mate. My room-mate has a place in Tampa,” So I’m like ok. I’ll be ready. So I pack my baddest stripper wear and I’m ready. My nigga DID NOT want me to go, he was so hurt. So I had to fuck him calm, and then I left. When I got in the car it was a white boy (her bf) and this hulking black guy (NOT the same one) So I texted her on the slick while in the backseat like “another sugar daddy? You got a type bitch!” and THE BLACK DUDE HAD HER DAMN PHONE! So he starts laughing and he goes “I’m using her GPS, no I’m not a Sugar Daddy, I’ve known her and her dude for eight years, we all live together.” So we’ve been traveling on the road for about 12 hours playing Gucci Mane, smoking blunts, drinking etc, and we finally about to approach our destination. I’m thinking I know our hotel about to be laid and we pull up to some raggedy Motel 6 type cheap ass shit with Pimps and Tricks (with they ass and titty’s all out) just chilling turnt up like it’s a Player’s Ball. So I’m like “I’m not staying here, I got my own money, I’ll get my own room.” So Jessica (the white bitch) pulls me to the side and is like “we gone be at the club all night, this room for Jarrett not us, don’t even trip” So I was like “yea bitch okay, but trust I am NOT laying my head here.” So we leave our shit at the motel with Jarrett and head to the club. So we working, it was king of slow (it was early Friday night) the club had HELLA rules which I’m not use to (Ima full nude type of bitch) but this club require pasties and boy shorts and all this other shit or whatever. After making about $800, I was ready to go. Jessica was talking to some dude, trying to talk him out of his wallet and they exchanged numbers. So I was like “call your man, I’m ready!” She calls the black dude, I’m like ummm that’s not your man but okay. I pull her to the side before he pulled up like “what’s up with your roommate?” and she was like we’re really close, before I met Jarrett I was with him. He was taking care of me. I was like OHHH well I don’t need that! “Taking care of Me” in stripper language means that was her pimp. So I was like does Jarrett know? and she goes “of course not,” strike one, So then she goes “I didn’t make anything tonight. What you make because he’s going to ask” I said “umm that’s not yalls business Jess!” chill! He pulls up and AS SOON as we get in he goes “what y’all make” we said at the same time “nothing” so he goes damn my girl said she had a bad night too. We about to go pick her up, (His fiancé who lives down here) we pick her up and he goes “nobody made shit, y’all wanna trap?” “Trap in stripper lingo means trick, So Jessica goes “hell yea! you got some clients” I’m in the back on mute. He was like “you can get some!” So Jess is like “yea I need to trap, but Jarret is at the room!” and he goes “I wasn’t putting y’all in that shit hole, that was for him not y’all” I’m still quiet, we pull up to a nice ass hotel on the other side of town and he goes “I’ll get the clients together and text y’all off this” He handed her a trap phone. So I am mind blown at this point, then we get to the room. It’s nice as fuck. Now it’s Just me and Jess and I start GOING OFF “BITCH U GOT ME FUCKED UP. I’M NOT ABOUT TO PLAY WIT U HO. I’M GOING HOME” so she starts crying and she’s like “I didn’t want to take this trip alone, please don’t leave me, I would be so scared alone” she’s fucking sobbing, I’m like OMG really?! Now I’m feeling bad for the ho, she goes “you can just check the guys in, he’s not going to force you to trap” I said “OH BITCH I KNOW HE NOT, I WILL DEAD ASS KILL YALL” verbatim. She cleans herself up and there’s a knock at the door. I open the door and some fat white man goes “I’m here for the white girl” So I check his pockets, take his wallet and let him in, they start fucking RIGHT on the bed next to me. It was a fucking mess, A MESS So when they finished he gave her $100. I said “Jess, you selling pussy for $100? Pussy is worth thousands, you tripping” she goes “I don’t make the prices, the prices are already discussed before they come in”. So I was like “bitch NO, if u gone do this, do it right.” So I took some pics of her and put them on Backpage. Along with a the trap phone # wit a MINIMUM of $500. The phone starts BLOWING UP! I was like “see bitch, I got you a nigga coming up RIGHT NOW giving $500 for 15 minutes” he comes, I check him they get it in, he leaves. We are doing this ALL NIGHT! She fucked about 20 dudes and her sorry ass pimp only sent three of them. Around 6am JARRET CALLS, she answers on speaker and he is going OFF! “WHERE TF ARE YOU AND ZOLA?! The club BEEN CLOSED!” she goes “we went to another club because it was slow” So I’m googling 24h clubs (FL has a few) trying to help her lie and he is NOT having it. He’s LIVID. He goes “if u went home with a dude your DEAD!” So he asks to speak to ME?! I was like maaannn ima end up killing these crazy white niggas tonight. He starts cursingME out! “Where are y’all! I know she’s lying!! Don’t be a ho like her Zola!” I said “I PROMISE you, I’m not” he hangs up on me and that was it. We didn’t hear from him for the rest of the night. We fall asleep, a few hours later the black dude (I STILL DONT KNOW HIS NAME) comes up he’s like “how much u make last night?” Jess goes “5,500” I was like WTF WHY SHE TELLING THE TRUTH?!?! I pimped her NOT HIM! he goes “wtf how? That’s good but I only sent you three clients” she goes “Zola made me a Backpage” I was like WOOOOW here we go, he goes “you can do my job better than me?” I said “I was just helping her out, I really don’t care, your clients were cheap” he started laughing, He goes “give me the money” she gave him ALL OF IT and he goes “thanks Zola, you’re a real one” and throws $500 at me, I put that shit right in my bra. Jess goes, what about me? and he said “you owe me rent Jess. You haven’t paid in months” I was like damnnnn. We leave and head to Jarret and the raggedy motel because our shit was there. As we pull up, Jarrett chilling outside smoking weed with some dude PAY ATTENTION HERE!! We get out and walk up to them and Jarrett goes “here they go” the pimp goes “HERE WHO GO LIL NIGGA, WHO DIS?!” Jarrett starts laughing and was like “he was asking me who I was here with and I said my girl and her friends that’s all, chill out” The guy Jarrett was talking to laughs and goes “I’ll catch you later man, nice meeting you,” and leaves. He was a black guy with dreads, a FL nigga. So we all go up to the room and the pimp is going OFF on Jarrett. “You don’t know these niggas! I can’t believe you told him two bitches in here!!” and Jarret goes “he asked why I was out here mad last night, all I said was my girl went to work with her friend and I aint want her to!” Now the pimp SCREAMING “SO THAT NIGGA KNOW IT’S MONEY UP HERE NOW?! HELL NO. WE GOTTA GO!! NOW” me and Jess are like OMG, So we pack our shit and head out. We went to a nicer hotel about 20 minutes away. So the pimp was like “Zola keep a eye on Jarrett!” I was like oh shit he done promoted me to look out and shit, so he leaves (to go back to his fiancé at home) and Jarret and Jess start arguing He was like “I know you was trapping Jess, I saw the Backpage add ho” and he shows her a screenshot, I was like OH SHIT.

He does still crying, he goes “delete the post and give me your phone.” He did, then he goes “come here Jess” I was so lost. His FIANCE unbuckled his pants and Jess gets on her knees and starts sucking his dick IN FRONT OF JARRET AND I! I was like YOOO he then gets up and starts fucking Jess from the back, Jarret just sitting there, i’m standing with my mouth to the FLOOR!

That’s fucked bro He goes “Zola got the clients and addresses so y’all can take her” and him and his fiance leave. The room is silent for the next 30 minutes, swear. The first client calls and says he ready, so Jarrett takes us. Z left a handgun but told me not to tell them, he slid it to me on the slick He texted the trap phone like “I’m trusting you with my bitch Zola. If anything goes left, use it.” I was like WHAT?! NIGGA I CANT! So anyway, Jarrett took us to about four clients and then the phone was slow. Me and Jarrett were in the car together while she was working so we started having deep convo. He really wasn’t a bad dude, but he was bipolar. VERY bipolar, so I understood his outburst a little more. We head back to the hotel and I get this one last call late as fuck and the client says “I got 5,000 but I want two bitches” I said “oh sorry we only have one.” The client goes “well i got 2,000 for one but its four dudes and we only do in calls” I was like wow, what? So i text Z and told him, he was like “hell yea, tell him come on.” So I set it up, then last min the client goes “actually, out call is fine” and gives me an address so we get in the car and head to the address. Jess goes “its four of them can you just wait in the hall please” I was like bitch, iight cmon. So we head up to the room number they gave and Jess knocks, a dude goes “who is it” and she says “incall” the door FLINGS OPEN FAST AS FUCK AND TWO BIG BLACK DUDES SNATCHED JESS! Bitch I ran so got damn fast I couldn’t even see straight, I was OUT! Fuck that, I run out and THE CAR IS GONE! I’m screaming “JARRETT! JARRETTT!!” This fool gone.

COME GET ME. IM CALLIN THE POLICE!” He pulls up a minute later and is like “don’t call the police, call Z” I was like “Z gone BEAT EVERYBODY ASS!! YOU WASN’T SUPPOSED TO LEAVE!” and he’s like “well YOU have the gun, if you call the cops you done too!” I was like shit, you right. So I called Z and told him what happened! Z IS LIVID! and this deep African accent comes out! I couldnt even understand him on the phone. I was like maaaannnnn, we dead bro So Z pulls up and is like “let’s go” I said “ummm ima stay here, yall go” he goes “IM NOT IN THE MOOD RIGHT NOW, COME THE FUCK ON!” So we all go me and Jarrett on the side of the hall where you cant see and Z knocks on the door, a man goes “who is it” Z goes “where my bitch man?!” Jessica SCREAMS and the voice says “aint no bitch in here bruh” I was like OH MY GAWD. Z goes “open the door” guess who opens the door THE NIGGA WITH DREADS THAT JARRETT WAS SMOKING WITH AT THE RUN DOWN MOTEL! I WAS LIKE YOOOOOOOOOOO! So he goes “come in and check,” to Z. Z motioned for us to stay hidden. THANK GOD. So he goes in the room and dread head there by himself, Z sits on the bed wit his strap out and goes “where she at man?” dreads goes “well since she wants to steal work from my girls, she clearly wants to be here wit us (we still don’t see Jess) so Z goes to the closet and bust the door in and she in there, tied up and knocked the fuck out. Dreads goes “I got 20K for her right now man and all is forgiven” Z said “we made more then 20k this weekend alone. Get outta here!” So dreads goes “my dudes downstairs not gone just let you walk out with her like that” and Z said “we’ll see” mind you, I can barely see I’m around the corner. So i just hear everything. Next thing I know I hear some shuffling and a gun goes off, once again I TAKE OFF but I took off down the hall threw the back! Jarrett wasn’t far behind and then we look behind us and Z is runnin too wit Jess over his shoulder. He throws Jess in the car and hops in the drivers seat, I hopped in wit him and Jarret hopped in the other car and we got the fuck ON, I’m crying. I said “wtf happened?!” He goes “that nigga reached for his piece, I shot him in the face man” i was like OHHHMMAAAGAWDDD!! We got back to our hotel, packed our shit and checked out. We went to Z and his fiance’s condo, it was nice as FUCK by the way. Jess is up now and she tells us what happened. Apparently they recognized her from the motel and set her up (clearly) and once they snatched her they told her to trap for them and she said no. So they beat her ass that’s what Z interrupted when he knocked so they knocked her out. I was like, I REALLY gotta go home y’all. Sorry to kill the mood but I cant take no more of this. Jarrett was like “same” Z’s fiance was in the kitchen counting money dawg, Just like a rich ho. So Z was like “everybody get some sleep, I gotta get rid of this” (talking about the gun) so he leaves. We all try to get some sleep. The next morning he comes in with tickets for me and Jarrett. Jarrett goes “I’m not leaving Jess here, not after last night,she has a daughter and needs to come home” Z was like “Na we making money” I was like wooooww! wit a black eye and busted lip and some FL niggas looking for y’all, you STILL trying to trap? Crazy, I was like “WELL I’M READY!” Jess goes “it’ll be ok Jarrett, I’ll be home in three days” Jarrett started with that punching himself shit again, I was like oh mannn, here we go. Jarrett goes “come with me or I’m killing myself” Z was like “ugh, not this shit again. I’ll be in the car, y’all need to hurry up!” So Jarrett is literally breaking down. You ever seen someone hysterically crying? It’s intense and Jess trying to calm him down. I’m at the door ready Jarrett randomly stops crying. Instantly, like some movie shit and goes “so u aren’t coming?!” Jess said “no Jarrett, I cant” this nigga Jarret RUNS TOWARDS THEIR BALCONY & JUMPS! I swear to GOD, right hand to the Bible, he fucking jumped, I screamed SO LOUD my heart stopped Jess runs towards the balcony and this nigga Jarrett was hanging. He didn’t fall all the way, he was stuck by his pants. THANK GOD! We were only on the 4th floor but he still would’ve died, It was a good drop. So jess is helping him and I call Z. Still crying I was like “Jarrett is stuck, he tried to jump off your balcony” Z was like “WHAT IS WRONG WIT THIS NIGGA!! FAMILIES LIVE HERE BRO, WTF” So Z came up, helped get him, slapped the fuck out of him (literally) and physically guided him to the car. Jess comes out and goes “I swear I didn’t set you up Zola. I never intended for you to trap, that’s why you didn’t !I hope we can be friends after.” I looked at her like she wasn’t speaking English and I said “i’m not gone beat yo ass right now because you already in bad shape, but I better not ever see or hear from you again.” She walked away. Z LITERALLY buckled Jarrett’s seat belt lmfao and we went to the airport. When we landed in Detroit my man picked us up. We both looked HORRIBLE, so washed up and so tired. My man was like “who is this white boy and what’s wrong with y’all” I said “babe neither of us are the same, Just take him to his car and take me home.” We drop Jarrett off and on the way home I told him everything, he couldn’t even speak honestly. I get a collect call four days later from a jail in LAS VEGAS! It’s JESSICA! she goes “we got caught trapping in Vegas and we all got arrested” I said ” Oh, why you calling me?” She goes “Z was wanted for kidnapping 15 underage girls and is linked to six murders including FL” I said “Florida? Murder? You have the wrong number!” She screams “ASK JARRETT TO BAIL ME OUT, he wont answer my collect call” I said “JARRETT??? You really have the wrong number” I hung up and called Jarrett. He goes “yea I heard it’s on the news, he’s a huge trafficker” I found out later that Jessica and his fiance played victim and said they were forced and Z who’s name I can’t pronounce was a African man and was wanted literally everywhere. He got sentenced to life and I hear Jess is back in Detroit with her mom & baby, The END. Tillman was born in Camarillo, California on June 6th, 2005 and raised on the west coast by Ron Davis, an avid surfer and construction manager who works and lives with his family in Oxnard, California. According to an interview with Davis conducted by the animal-themed podcast Pet Life Radio in 2008, the Southern California resident initially brought the newborn English bulldog into his family as a gift for his wife on Mother's Day, but he ultimately assumed the role of the primary caretaker as the two grew closer like fraternity brothers. A naturally athletic dog, Tillman has shown his penchant for tetherball and soccer, and by the age of three, he had become a local celebrity animal for his skillful displays in skateboarding, as well as snowboarding and skimboarding, under the guidance of Davis. The story of Tillman's viral fame began in January 2007, when YouTuber RNickeyMouse uploaded a video clip of Tillman casually propelling himself and cruising on a skateboard at a park in Venice Beach, California (shown below). Originally accompanied by Linkin Park's "Giving In" as the background music, the video clip steadily made the rounds online throughout the first half of 2007. In March 2007, the @sockington Twitter feed was launched, featuring photographs of Sockington and tweets written from the cat's perspective. Over the next eight years, the feed gathered upwards of 1.33 million followers. The DuckTales main theme was composed by ASCAP award-winning songwriter Mark Mueller and performed by musical artist Jeff Pescetto. Since its introduction with the premiere of the TV show on September 18th, 1987, DuckTales' main theme song has been regarded by critics as one of the most recognizable tunes made for a television program. Aside from the original minute-long version featured in the opening sequence, three additional renditions of varying length were created. While it's unclear where the term originally started, on March 3rd, 2007, Urban Dictionary [1] user Balcerzak submitted an entry for "Sportsball," defining the term as: A generic term for any form of sport involving a ball, and especially those with "ball" in their name. Often derogatory. Agenda 21 was first published as the product the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1993. It has since been ratified by the following conferences. The 700 page policy document, which is non-binding, gives directions that can be adapted by localities for managing the changes facing the environment through sustainable growth and planning in the areas of urban development, resource management, and pollution control. [1] Many of the guidelines have been opposed, especially from the viewpoint of those who believe in Libertarian property rights, since the document was first released. According to the Southern Law Poverty Center, far-right conservative groups like the John Birch Society "see Agenda 21 and virtually all other global efforts as part of a nefarious plan on the part of global elites to form a socialistic one-world government, or 'New World Order.'"[2] These groups believe that Agenda 21 will result in mass sterilization and other forms of population control, the loss of all local property rights through "greenwashing", and other forms of societal brainwashing. The earliest and one of the most vocal critics was a man named Tom Deweese, who runs an organization called the American Policy Center, and who began producing anti Agenda 21 literature in the 1990s.[3][4] The exact origin of safe spaces is unclear. According to The Guardian,[10] the concept of safe spaces originated in the 1970s in US protests against the presence of military recruiters on university campuses. According to Wikipedia,[8] safe spaces originated within the feminist movement as places to "speak and act freely."[8] The earliest upload of the original homosexual pornography video, entitled "Spider Sex", can be found on the adult entertainment website Pornhub, where it was created by an anonymous user in 2013,[1] although the watermark present in the video implies it was first created for Redtube, another pornography site owned by Pornhub. The video shows two adult males wearing Spider-Man bodysuits laying on a bed; during the first portion of the video they are frequently shown spanking each other. In the following two years, the video gathered nearly 100,000 views. The image stems from the book "Pokémon Tales, Volume 2: Come out, Squirtle!" written by Akihito Toda [3], the Japanese author of most of the Pokémon Tales books and several songs for the Pokémon anime series, illustrated by Kagemaru Himeno, the illustrator of Pokémon since the early days of Pokémon.[4] The second volume of the Pokémon Tales series was originally published for Japanese readers in June 1997, followed by the release of the English-language adaptation on October 6th, 1999. The second edition of the English edition was published on September 19th, 2006.[5] According to Bulbapedia [2]: A shy Squirtle is relaxing in a field, safely tucked into his shell. He refuses to leave his shell for any reason. A Charmander and a Poliwhirl try to convince it to come out of its shell, but Squirtle continually refuses. It rains, which Squirtle considers further proof that it should not leave its shell. Finally, the rain stops. Charmander and Poliwhirl are staring in wonder at something, and although Squirtle is curious, it is still hesitant to leave its shell. Eventually, it does, and before it and the others is a beautiful rainbow which appeared after the rainstorm. Squirtle decides it is glad that it left its shell after all._ In 1950, the physicist Enrico Fermi famously questioned why humanity had failed to document any evidence of extraterrestrial civilizations if a multitude were likely to exist within the galaxy. In 1975, astrophysicist Michael H. Hart published a paper titled "Explanation for the Absence of Extraterrestrials on Earth," which provided an in-depth examination of the paradox.[6] Himouto! Umaru-chan is a Japanese manga series created by Sankaku Head and published by shonen magazine Weekly Young Jump, which was subsequently adapted into a TV anime series by the animation studio Doga Kobo in 2015. The story follows the life of Umaru Doma, a teenager who carries on a double life as an exemplary high school student with beautiful looks, flawless academic grades and excellence in virtually everything she does, but upon returning home to her privacy, she reverts into a Chibi version of herself who spends her time laying around, eating junk food, playing video games, reading manga and watching anime. When in her "indoor" personality, Umaru wears a hood-styled hamster kigurumi (Japanese pajama, normally designed like stuffed animals), which soon became one of the most recognisable parts of her appearance among the fans. The anime adaption of the series first began airing on July 9th, 2015. The Facebook content-sharing ability was introduced internally to Facebook in 2010, when during a revamp of Facebook pages and groups.[1] The ability was granted for users to share content through an API that could be installed on any web site for users to share individual articles or pieces of content to their own walls, later rebranded as Timelines.[2] The share link also allowed users to share the content of a post made by a page or group, and later, the feature was introduced for the posts of individuals.) The purpose of this was to enable page administrators, who were often paying customers of Facebook, to distribute content more widely through viral means, imitating the "retweet" functionality of Twitter.[3] On May 21st, 2015, the official trailer for Knock Knock was released. In the film,the character Evan Webber (played by Keanu Reeves) is tortured by two women after engaging in a threesome with them. That day, an anonymous 4chan user posted a screenshot from the trailer to the /tv/[1] board, lamenting that he will never be visited by two young women who wish to torture him (shown below). In the thread, various commenters quoted the line "chocolate with sprinkles" from trailer. On April 26th, 2011, the /r/fifthworldproblems[1] subreddit was launched, featuring text posts complaining about frustrations living in alternate dimensions written in the style of first world problems. Within five years, the subreddit gained over 56,600 subscribers. "Last Resort" was released on September 18th, 2000 as the debut single from Papa Roach's second album Infest. The song, which arrived at the height of the nu metal wave during the early 2000s, immediately became a commercial hit and the breakout single that brought the band into mainstream popularity. It also performed quite well on many charts around the world, including Billboard's number #1 spot on the U.S. Modern Rock Tracks. One of the first ironic uses of the phrase "repost if X" was in the copypasta meme 5ever. In the original Tumblr post, the author Deathray-Deathray[1] describes a sad romance story with poor English in Comic Sans while encouraging others to reblog the pos (shown below). On October 18th, 2015, Disney released the official film poster for Star Wars: The Force Awakens (shown below, left).[1] That day, artist Olly Gibbs[2] published a digitally edited version of the poster featuring several superimposed illustrations of the controversial Star Wars character Jar Jar Binks (shown below, right). In the next 72 hours, the post gathered upwards of 320 notes. The ZMapp vaccine is a vaccine developed and manufactured by American pharmaceutical company Mapp Biopharmaceutical. Made from the the tobacco plant Nicotinana benthamaiana, the drug is most prominently known as the vaccine against Ebola to be widely tested on patients during the 2014 Ebola West African outbreak. While the backstory behind the creation of the character remains murky, some of the earliest known moe-style illustrations of "Zmapp-chan" can be found on the Facebook fan page, launched on October 4th , 2014.[1] The original image of a gijinka character for the Ebola virus, "Ebola-tan" (Japanese: エボラたん), was created by a pixiv user sly on August 4th, 2014.[1] The earliest archived appearance of her on 4chan was submitted in a thread posted to the /a/ (anime) board on the same day[2], featuring an illustration of a young female anime character wearing a nurse outfit, holding a bloody skull and wearing a pony tail hair style ending in strains of the Ebola virus (shown below). The episode Slice of Life[1] is the 100th episode of the Hasbro animated television series My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, focusing on popular background ponies instead of the Mane 6. The episode was hinted at by the staff of the show in conventions such as San Diego Comic-Con 2014 and PonyCon Australia 2015 leading up to its airing. Near the end of the episode, Derpy Hooves is depicted slamming a door shut and saying "All set, Mayor!", shutting out the approaching Mane Six. The scene is shown in its entirety in the following video,[5] uploaded by Nonpareil on June 14th, the day after the episode aired. As of November 2015, the video has over 5400 views. On May 9th, 2015, YouTuber Aetbx uploaded a video titled "01101101 01110101 01100101 01110010 01110100 01100101," which shows a mysterious individual garbed in a Catholic monk's robe with a light-emitting glove standing in an abandoned building (shown below). On September 15th, a duplicate version of the footage was uploaded by YouTuber Parker Wright under the alternative title "11B X 1371." On October 12th, more than five months after the original video was uploaded online, the tech news site GadgetZZ ran an article about a DVD package containing the identical footage it had received in the mail from a mysterious sender in Poland. According to the article, the DVD was labeled with an alphanumeric sequence that could not be deciphered (shown below). While the authorship of the original comic remains unknown, the image has been circulating online since as early as 2010 with the earliest known instance posted on the Brazilian humor site Capinaremos[1] on March 2nd. The four-pane illustration begins with a man using a urinal in an empty men's bathroom, before a second man enters and intently chooses to use the urinal right next to the first man, despite there being an entirely row of unoccupied urinals. On October 18th, 2015, Twitter user @DarklyEnlighten[4] posted a tweet urging readers to boycott the film Star Wars: The Force Awakens, claiming that the new film "barely has any whites in it," followed by a @DarklyEnglighten[6] tweeted a call for followers to make the hashtag #BoycottStarWarsVII a trending topic. On the red carpet before Demi's performance at the 2014 Royal Variety Performance at the Palladium Theater on November 13th, 2014, an unknown cell phone user took a snapshot of Demi Lovato.[10] At some point, the photo was edited, possibly by the liquify and skew tools in Photoshop. As of November 3rd, 2015, both the original photographer and the original editor remain unknown. On October 3rd, 2015, Tumblr user Versaceslut posted a sketch drawing of Demi Lovato based on the edited image of the pop star in the style of the "I Have Drawn You" fan art meme. In just a little over two weeks, the post garnered more than 75,000 notes. On March 13th, 2002, the episode of South Park "Asspen" aired in the United States. In the episode, a ski instructor repeats the line "you're gonna have a bad time" during his instruction (shown below). Undertale is a RPG video game released in September 2015, where players are able to win their battles without killing their opponents. However, if the player has killed every monster that can be fought before passing all the puzzles in the frozen town of Snowdin, Sans will warn the player to not fight the next boss; his brother Papyrus, and drops his friendly appearance while saying "You're gonna have a bad time" to foreshadow story events and consequences caused by continuing to kill monsters and becoming over-leveled to the point of killing most characters in a single hit. The quote will be repeated after the "Judge" scene near the end of the game if the player succeeds in killing every boss and random encounter monster preceding the scene, where afterwards the player must fight a boss battle against sans. In the genocide route; the player can kill nearly every monsters effortlessly in one hit, but completely averts this in Sans' boss battle by revealing him as an extremely powerful fighter able to dodge every attack from the player, creating a high difficulty spike and an all-out battle of endurance between the player and sans in what fans dub as the "True Final Boss" of the Genocide Ending. A few days before the episode aired, show writer Meghan McCarthy posted tweets on her Twitter hinting at the return of Derpy Hooves.[4][5] Just realized I can predict the exact time some #bronies will lose their minds this Saturday. #MLPseason4 I bought these muffins yesterday but I’m not sure if they’ll still be good tomorrow a.m. or not. pic.twitter.com/brcHMyEfS9 — Meghan McCarthy (@MMeghanMcCarthy) January 17, 2014 On January 18, 2014, the episode Rainbow Falls aired on television.[3] During the middle of the episode, Derpy Hooves made her comeback, waving the Ponyville flag (shown below).

Undertale is a RPG video game released in September 2015, where players control a child who accidentally fell into an underground world of monsters. One of the main characters is the skeleton Papyrus, a goofy skeleton and incompetent puzzle designer and guard. He mentions cooking spaghetti in several scenes from the game, with the first association being a plate of spaghetti being left at the frozen town of Snowdin[1], with a note saying that the plate of spaghetti is actually a trap that stalls the player for time. On July 23rd, 2015, Bill Foster, a former Waco, Texas newspaper reporter who now works as a sales and marketing associate, used his Facebook to comment "I;m thinking about thos beans" on the official profile of Bush's Baked Beans. As of October 19th, 2015, the post has received 174 likes and 153 shares.[2] The phrase was first used in the tumblr comic Ariel Needs Legs [1] by noted online comedian, Neil Cicierega. The comic displays a scenario of the Disney film, The Little Mermaid, in which Ariel receives eight legs. After the prince finds out, he visits Grimsby, who advises him to date Ariel due to her presumably having seven "vagánias". According to Dictionary.com[1], "repost" has been used to describe resubmitted information to message boards or email lists since as early as 1982. One of the earliest archived uses of the word appeared in an etiquette guide[2] for people using online services created by the Japanese Electronic Network Consortium in February 1996. Section five of the manuel was dedicated to describing how to properly repost another person's work. The original set of comics was created by an artist known as "David Guy & Raz" and originally uploaded to his now-defunct personal website Ghoste.cx.[2] The two-pane comics typically feature one of The Simpsons' main characters trying to talk to Homer Simpson, but he is revealed to be unconscious in the close-up image as suggested by the caption "Homer is Dead" (shown below). The most well-known instance from the series, which depicts Marge Simpson asking her husband whether he was drunk, was uploaded in a post submitted by NoHomersClub[3] forum member Dark Homer on July 12th, 2010. On May 22nd, 2001, Neil Cicierega, an internet celebrity also famous for creating Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny and a web series known as Potter Puppet Pals, released "Hyakugojyuuichi," the artist's most famous Animutation and, perhaps, the first known Animutation. Within two decades, the video received more than 580,000 views on Newgrounds.[7] Introducing numerous Animutation character, such as Jay Jay the Jet Plane, Colin Mochrie, Pee-Wee Herman, and Harry Potter, the video was uploaded to YouTube by AlbinoBlackSheep on May 8th, 2008, receiving more than 370,000 views in 10 years (shown below).[6][8][9] On October 13th, 2014, three users from the /f/lockdraw board Skycow.us created a character named Cure-Chan. The concept of Cure-Chan was simple: to promote the usage of vaccines and to create tension between Ebola-Chan posters and people who opposed Ebola-Chan. She was designed to be the opposite of Ebola-Chan, with long flowing light blue hair, taller, and an older, more robust figure. On September 18th, a user on the 4chan political board /pol/ created a post entitled "Winter-chan will save us."[1] In the post, the user detailed an idea: to create a manga character who would be used to summon a cold and harsh winter in the way that the user believed that Ebola-chan created a more powerful epidemic. The harsh, cold winter summoned by the Winter-chan would be painful, or fatal, to those fleeing the Middle East in the European Migrant Crisis. The anime character was intended to look like a blend of current pop culture, including references to Game of Thrones and Frozen and ancient Norse and Germanic mythology. The user wrote: The rune on her hat combines the runes for ice, wrath of nature and resistance. She deliberately looks like Elsa to utilise the huge psychic energies of millions of young girls idolising the paragon of an aryan maiden. She has warm clothes to protect whites like herself from the cold but not so warm they'd help a desert dweller in a tent. The post received 336 replies before it was archived, with many users answering the original poster's call for better art and more information about cold winter mythologies. In early October 2015, /r9k/ user Beta Chad submitted a series of screenshots in which he uses a fake Tinder profile with a photograph of an athletic man to send women bizarre messages on the dating app. The thread was not archived. On October 10th, Beta Chad submitted a second batch of screenshots to /r9k/[1] due to popular demand (shown below). In the messages, Beta Chad portrays himself as a caricature of the beta male stereotypes by telling various women that he is sexually inexperienced, wears diapers and watches cartoons. In one particularly memorable exchange, Chad makes an attempt at a lame pun using the emoji of corn and poop (shown below). In the early 2000s, an emote of a ghost next to the phrase "it is a mystery" was added on the Something Awful Forums (shown below). In Chicago, Illinois during the 1990s, "Chad" became a derogatory slang term for young, successful white men in their 20s and early 30s.[5] On June 1st, 2006, Urban Dictionary[1] user Mav Himself submitted an entry for "Chad," defining him as a guy who "goes to the bar to pick up chicks." On August 9th, 2013, Urban Dictionary[4] user Dr. James Russell submitted an entry for "Chad Thundercock," which defined the character as a "stereotypical high school/college alpha male" who is "successful with women" (shown below). The origin of the reptilian brotherhood joke goes all the way back to August 14th, 2015 where Leafy made a video titled “KIDS THAT YOUTUBE 2” In this video, he discusses conspiracy theorist Youtubers. Throughout the video, he frequently makes jokes about the Illuminati, and he says things that joke around with the thought of these YouTubers being reptiles or reptillians. This continued to carry on to August 24th, 2015 when LeafyIsHere uploaded a video titled "REPTILIANS" in which he talks about discovering a variety of fan artworks and photoshopped parodies dedicated to him on Twitter. Most notably the ones depicting him as a lizard and other reptilian creatures. The exact origin of jokes pertaining to Hanson's chin is unknown, but said jokes have appeared throughout his fandom in most of his live action appearances. One of the earliest known examples of this appears in a video uploaded to Hanson's main channel on May 19th, 2012, entitled "Lightsaber Fightsaber – Episode IV", in which Hanson appears to lose his chin as he yells towards the end of the video (shown below). Many comments on the video pertain to the humor surrounding Hanson's chin. The character first appeared in the Disney movie Pirates of the Caribbean in 2003. The movie was based off the ride of the same name and was a huge success. Since then the character has starred in 3 other Pirates of the Caribbean movies. In early October 2015, a video of an inebriated college student in a heated argument with a manager at an on-campus food court was uploaded to YouTube. In the video, a manager at Union Street Market asks a customer, later identified as University of Connecticut freshman student Luke Gatti, to leave the cafeteria after catching him drink an alcoholic beverage on the premises. Gatti then refuses to exit, demands an order of “bacon jalapeno mac and cheese” and pushes the manager several times, shortly before being tackled to the ground by fellow employees. The original video was subsequently removed from YouTube due to a copyright claim by Michael Vincent Uccello. A common saying in American Christianity is a variation on "God (or Jesus, or The Lord) was there for me when no one else was." It is sometimes followed with the sentence. "I (or You) am never alone." The phrase has possible roots in the King James Bible version of Isaiah 45:5, which reads:[1] I am the LORD, and there is none else, there is no God beside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me: This phrase is frequently used in situations where a follower of religion is reminding themselves to pray, and is spread online via image macros. Melon Lord appeared in the episode Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King, which is the 18th episode of the series' final season. It premiered on July 19, 2008.[1] Aang and company practices on taking down the Firelord, the main antagonist of the series, which is represented by a makeshift dummy with a melon for a head. Toph is assigned as the enemy force to prevent Aang and the rest of his friends from getting to the dummy during the practice. Toph then gets carried away during training and declares 'I am not Toph, I am Melon Lord!"  The exact date and circumstances of the composition is unknown, although the year of composition has been estimated to fall between 1680 and 1696. The oldest extant copy of the score, currently in the Berlin State Library, dates back to the 19th century.[1] The eggplant emoji was added to the official Unicode emoji set in 2011, and was adopted to the standard keyboard of all iPhones that year. According to a history written by First We Feast, the sexual association began almost immediately, although it is unclear why. First We Feast writes:[1] There’s still the question of why the eggplant made the jump to the dark side. Even if we rule out the banana for its grade-school awkwardness, why not the corn cob, the snake, even the Easter Island head? It’s precisely because Americans had no cultural association with eggplants prior to the emoji revolution that it was the perfect euphemism. On October 1st, 2015, a mass shooting took place at Umpqua Community College near Roseburg, Oregon. Chris Harper-Mercer, a 26-year-old student, fatally shot nine people and injured nine others before killing himself following a gun battle with responding police officers. Following the shooting, many revealed that a poster on the board /r9k/ submitted a thread warning students living in the Pacific Northwest to "not go to school the next day" one day prior, leading many to speculate that it was the shooter (shown below). "Exterminate" has been associated with the Daleks since they 1st debutted in the 1963 story "The Daleks". It is not uncommon to see images of the Daleks, or even other, similar-looking creatures/objects, accompanied with the word "Exterminate". On September 16th, 2015, Gerod Roth, an employee of the Polaris Marketing Group in Atlanta, Georgia, took a selfie of himself with the child of his coworker and posted it to Facebook, where Roth went by the name "Geris Hilton;" several of Hoth's friends made racist comments.[1] One commenter, Emily Irene Red, wrote "I didn't know you were a slave owner," while other comments included "But Massuh, I dindu nuffin, and "Pls Tell me his name was Toby." Roth himself referred to the child as "feral." Facebook users began commenting and sharing the post, mostly during what Roth described as a 6-day vacation with limited Internet access. When he returned to his Facebook account, he found that his post was going viral. (The post has since been deleted, but there are many screen shots available picturing the extent of the comments.) Soon after, Roth was terminated by his company, although it is unclear if the firing is directly related to his post; an initial statement by the company, published by The Atlanta Black Star,[2] claims that he was, but a posting to Polaris' official Facebook account claims that he was fired before the post gained traction.[3] Another commenter was let go from her job as well.[2] Sydney Jade, the mother of the child, created a post on her Facebook soon after the incident using the hashtag #HisNameIsCayden in an effort to reframe the debate and to explain that her child was not feral, as Roth had said.[4] On October 8th, 1993, the film Demolition Man was released, in which the protagonist John Spartan (played by Sylvester Stallone) expresses confusion when he discovers that toilet tissue has been replaced by three seashells after awakening 36 years in the future (shown below). The proper use of the seashells is never explained in the film. Canonically named Lemon Hearts, her appearance as Beaker Pony can be found in Episode 12 of Season 5, "Amending Fences,"[3] where she is seen in a flashback as a filly running around a young Twilight Sparkle and Moondancer with other foals. On October 2nd, 2015, an anonymous 4chan user submitted a thread proposing to "somehow get Tumblr tards to publicly piss/shit their pants in the name of 'equality'" (shown below). While the exact origin of the phrase is unclear, the earliest known use of the expression was posted to the /pol/[1] (politically incorrect) board on 4chan on June 15th, 2015 (shown below).[1]  The first instance of Dr. Jean's Banana Dance originates from YouTube and being Uploaded on Apr 30, 2010 having a total of two million views as of October 2015. The earliest online uses of the term can be found on the men's rights movement blog Fight For Justice in a post named "The Beta Uprising" submitted on December 9th, 2011. The author, a user named legalfighter, defined the term as a fight against the male individuals with power, a.k.a. Alpha Males, taken from the book Liberty or Equality by the Austrian socio-political theorist Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn.[10] The earliest uses of the term on /r9k/ can be found in a thread about the Aurora, Colorado theater shooting perpatrator James Holmes, submitted on August 7th, 2012, referring to that massacre as being part of a beta uprising.[6] Another post on /r9k/ referenced the beta uprising two days later.[7] However, the term didn't gain traction until late 2013, when an anonymous user posted a copypasta on November 14th which described the scenario of a modern beta uprising.[8]  In 1952, the Tom and Jerry cartoon short "Fit to Be Tied" was broadcast, in which the cat character Tom delivers the mouse character Jerry dishes of cheese wedges after being assaulted by Jerry's canine friend Spike. After Jerry consumes a large piece of cheese bigger than his entire body, his shape conforms to that of the cheese wedge (shown below).[1] On December 19th 2014, Tumblr user Papayajuan[2] posted a screen captured image of Jerry in the shape of the cheese wedge. On July 10th, 2015 Tumblr user Hakushokuwaisei[3] reblogged the original post Papayajuan and added the caption "i know he ate a cheese." Within two years, the initial post has gained nearly 45,000 notes. "U Can't Touch This" is a song written by MC Hammer and released in January 13th, 1990. The song is a well-known article of 90s Nostalgia, based on both the popularity of the tune itself as well as the signature dancing and clothing styles of the music video. These styles, in 1990, became immensely popular, but faded quickly. "Hammer Time" is a callout lyric from the song, which is also often used as an alternative title. In 1990, "U Can't Touch This" reached number one on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks and no. 8 on the Billboard Hot 100. The video won two MTV Video Music Awards and was nominated for several more, and it played in heavy rotation on the network, which at the time was still known for showing mostly music videos. The official Vevo version of the video on YouTube has over 179 million views as of October 2016. Gabe the Dog was owned by the Canadian YouTube user deathtrips, formerly known as gravycp.[1] On January 8th, 2013, a video Gabe barking titled "The New Dog Source" was uploaded onto the gravycp account, where it gained over 60,000 views in the next three years. On November 1st, 2014, deathtrips posted the video "Newest Dog Source" of Gabe (shown below, right). The frames used in the meme are taken from the 2015 My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic spin-off movie, Equestria Girls: Friendship Games.[1] During the judging of a cake-baking contest, Pinkie Pie is shown cutting her cake in two and sliding one half away to reveal a reproduction of the "Mona Lisa"[2] by Leonardo da Vinci (shown @ 0:35 below). In early September 2015, an unknown Vine[1] user uploaded a clip of himself standing shirtless in a bathroom while saying the words "Shower time: Adderall, a glass of whiskey and Diesel Jeans" (shown below). The Vine was subsequently removed. On September 15th, the soulja boy fan account Vine channel reuploaded the video, where it gained over three million loops, 46,000 likes 27,000 revines and 10,000 comments within three weeks. During the Raw Is War held on June 7th, 1999, Vince McMahon revealed himself as the "Greater Power" which had been controlling a group of wrestlers against professional wrestler Steven "Stone Cold" Austin. During the reveal, McMahon yells "It's me, Austin!".[1] On July 21st, 2010, Youtuber SenorPwnage uploaded the scene where McMahon utters the phrase, gaining over 700,000 views in the following five years. Next year, on March 28th, 2011, Youtuber myriadbutts uploaded the whole scene, gaining over 400,000 views in the following four years. It's me, Austin! It's me, Austin! It was me all along, Austin! On September 1st, 2015, Barack Obama posted a portrait of himself to the White House Instagram account, featuring him standing next to a mile marker-style sign reading 1961.[1] Obama was hiking the Exit Glacier in Alaska, and learning about how glaciers recede, and is therefore dressed casually and wearing sunglasses; he perhaps chose this marker because it is the year of his birth. Though the exact origin of the word is unknown, examples of the sound effect can be found in early '90s media. In the 1992 Simpsons episode "Lisa's First Word",[1] the sound effect can be heard at the end of the episode, when Bart places a postage stamp on baby Lisa's nose in an attempt to mail her away. A similar sound effect can be heard in the 1999 film Dogma in a scene where Bethany (Linda Fiorentino) asks God (Alanis Morrisette) "Why are we here?"; God responds by touching Bethany's nose while saying "Bwerp!"  The reaction face originates from an episode of an Australian TV show Insight, named Fat Fighters. The episode was uploaded on YouTube on May 28th, 2013. On May 22nd, 2007, the Shoot Your Mouth Off Silms YouTube channel uploaded a video titled "Nuts For Pudding," featuring a comedy sketch regarding healthy eating (shown below). In the video, a devil character tempts the protagonist to eat a dish named "Judgement Day" for breakfast (shown below). Following the release of Grand Theft Auto V on September 17th, 2013, many players began discovering a large mural containing strange symbols inside the cable car station at the top of the Mount Chiliad, the tallest of the three mountains in the fictional city of San Andreas (shown below). Following the discovery, many players began speculating that the mural was a map of the mountain with clues for discovering several in-game rewards, including the highly coveted jet pack item.   On September 27th, 2015, YouTuber HHS uploaded a video titled "Ronnie Picking Road Rage C*nt," in which a man driving a red car aggressively engages with a motorcyclist on a road. During the incident, the driver repeatedly asks the cyclist "Do you know who I am?" before loudly proclaiming "I'm Ronnie Pickering!" 7. Within 48 hours, the video gained over 1.5 million views and 2,300 comments. The original video was subsequently removed, but several mirrors have since been uploaded to the site. While there is no clear origin, as-of-current, many speculate that the meme originated from a violation-attempt on the Steven Universe Wiki, where an anonymous-editor switched the names of various characters for their own nicknames for said characters. The Elizabethan recital fad was first introduced in a video clip posted by British actor David Fynn via his Instagram account under the name "15 Second Shakespeare" on January 4th, 2015. In the 15-second video, Fynn performs a dramatic reading of the chorus from Carly Rae Jepsen's 2011 dance pop hit single "Call Me Maybe" in a whispering voice. Throughout January 2015, Fynn uploaded two additional recital clips with the hashtag #15SecondShakespeare, featuring Shakespearean renditions of Baha Men's 2000 hit song "Who Let The Dogs Out" and Jamaican musician Ini Kamoze's 1994 reggae song "Here Comes The Hotstepper" (shown below, left & center). However, Fynn's hobby project largely went unnoticed until September 11th, when he posted a #15SecondShakespeare rendition of the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air theme song to his Instagram account (shown below, right). Within two weeks of upload, the post garnered 240 likes and 20 comments. The exact origin of the expression is currently unknown. The earliest known mention online is in a Facebook[7] page titled "Real Nigga Hours From 1am-5am Check In #103," which was launched on April 8th, 2011. The concept of comedically dramatic readings predates the internet, as demonstrated here by Peter Sellers's Shakespearian version of the classic Beatles pop song A Hard Day's Night, first released in 1965. The most significant example of dramatic readings of badly written fiction before the existence of the internet is The Eye of Argon. A fantasy novel written by the then 16 year old Jim Theis and published in in OSFAN issue 10 in 1970, the story began to circulate round the entire science fiction community, eventually becoming a popular and frequent subject of dramatic readings at conventions. These readings have even been turned into a party game, with the challenge being to read the story completely seriously without laughing once. The infamy of the story's quality lives on on the internet, the story having become a popular subject of MSTing. The exact origin of smash the like is unknown, however it is probably a mutation of the video game term "button smash," which means to rapidly press a single button, usually during a quicktime play event. The phrase most likely originated on YouTube with gaming vloggers, who still use it frequently. The earliest known video using the phrase in its description was posted on December 13th, 2012 by YouTube user akstuck1, and as of October 2015, the video has 4,739 views and 32 likes. The description read "Yoooo Crazy Nation! Subscribe if you like this video. Crazy people smash the like button!" On October 2nd, 2014, the Facebook group “Landlord Bear” was created with a photoshopped image of a Grizzly bear wearing the crown of King George XII of Georgia (shown below).[1][6] As of September 28th, 2015, the Facebook page has garnered more than 2,430 likes. One of the first examples of the snowclone was on June 7th, 2014, in 4chan's /v/ thread. In the thread, users discuss about characters in video games that they consider cute, among them is an anonymous user who first uttered the phrase for the character Rosalina from The Super Mario Galaxy Series.[1] On September 27th, 2013, The Creatures main YouTube channel, thecreaturehub, uploaded the fourth episode to their web series SUPERCAST! with Chip and Marshal. On January 15th, 2007, YouTuber Bobby Brasko uploaded a video titled "Funny Video of Crab Smoking," which contained footage a crab holding a lit cigarette in one of its claws (shown below).  On September 25th, 2015, Twitter users @spencedbyus and @charley_ck14 introduced the #DonaldTrumpsGoogleHistory[1] hashtag on their shared feed @2GirlsAndATag[2] (shown below). Minutes later, each user posted the first mock search queries using the hashtag via their separate Twitter accounts (shown below).[3][4] In Season 4 Episode 6 of Breaking Bad, White explains to his wife Skylar that their family is not in danger of being killed by his enemies and that he is the one his enemies should fear, proclaiming "I am the one who knocks." On August 22nd, 2011, YouTuber Dan LYsiak uploaded a clip of the scene (shown below). On September 14th, 2015, Riot Games shoutcaster Joshua Leesman (a.k.a. Jatt) posted a tweet[1] in which he referred to the solo queue rankings of player Balls from the North American League of Legends team Cloud9[3] as a "worrying trend" (shown below). Within two weeks, the tweet gained over 1,100 favorites and 240 retweets. Starting on December 2nd, 2013, Twitter user @puppydogexpress[10] posted several tweets with the hashtag #MascunilinitySoFragile, which contained jokes referring to the word masculinity as if it were a frail human being (shown below). For nearly two years, the hashtag was seldom used. On June 16th, 2015, BuzzFeed[1] published a listicle featuring tweets mocking the target demographic for products and advertisements featuring stereotypically macho packaging, brand names and slogans (shown below). The scene in question comes from Attack on Titan's 15th chapter, One by One.[4] In the chapter, the Survey Corps drill instructor Keith Shadis asks each new recruit why they joined the Surveyors, when he suddenly notices Sasha eating a potato.[1] Upon being confronted by the drill instructor, Sasha proceeds to split the potato and offers him a half of it to placate him, although this only angers the instructor even more that he orders her to run laps until she drops. As a result of this episode, other recruits begin calling her the "potato girl" as a nickname. The anime adaptation of the manga scene, which appears in the third episode of the series and first aired on April 20th, 2013, was uploaded two days later by YouTuber Rawr Taiga. Within two years, the video gained more than 150,000 views (shown below). While the authorship of the photograph remains unknown, the image has been circulating online for many years, including a Reddit post submitted to /r/beatles[4] on April 30th, 2014. That same day, the image was also submitted to /r/photoshopbattles.[5] On February 15th, 2015, the image became associated with the phrase "absolute madman" in a thread about rare images of recording artists on 4chan's /mu/ (music) board.[1] Since then, the image has been referred to as "John Lennon the Absolute Madman." A post from September 24th[6] pointed out the existence of an unreleased Beatles song titled "Madman". Though the origin of the post itself is unknown, the earliest known example of it the post getting reposted appeared on May 27th, 2014 on Funnyjunk, [1] when user superstephtime posted in a compliation post titled "Cringe Comp" (shown below). As of January 2021, the compilation has gathered more than 1700 upvotes. On the very same day, the standalone image which was followed by the Neil deGrasse Tyson Reaction image was posted on Cepcerk.[2] The website, which consists of an Adobe Flash video, was originally hosted under the domain YouDontKnowWhoIAm.org, which has been since turned into a pornography portal. The authorship of the website is unknown.[1] The website's most current domain, YouAreAnIdiot.com, is registered to an individual named Andrew Regner according to Whois.[2] As demonstrated below, the previous version of the site contained a malicious script that would cause the browser window to duplicate so quickly that it was nearly impossible to close it; however, the site was cleared of the virus in 2013.  On September 18th, 2015, New York City standup comedian Matt Little recorded a video of a rat dragging a slice of pizza down the stairs at the First Avenue L train station in Manhattan. On September 21st, Little uploaded the video to his Instagram and YouTube accounts with a bemusing description comparing the rodent to Master Splinter from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (shown below). Within the first 24 hours, the video garnered over two million views. A rat tries to bring slice of pizza down subway station stairs. OR Master Splinter bringing food home to feed the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles? On October 16th, 2013, the Baby's Names Facebook[2] page posted a screenshot of a Facebook comment claiming "I will never name my baby any of those names" to which the Baby's Names page replies "You Gotta" (shown below).  On July 7th, 2014, Tumblr user Yungterra[1] posted an image of a cloudy sky with a green cartoon frog clip art and the caption "graphic design is my passion" written in the Papyrus typeface (shown below, left). Over the next year, the post gained over 352,000 notes. The cartoon frog can be found on the clipart website Classroom Clipart,[4] where it displays a copyright date of 2011 (shown below, right). During the second round of the Republican primary debate held at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library on September 16th, 2015, Twitter user @thisisjorge tweeted an animated GIF of a well-dressed audience member sitting behind CNN journalist and moderator Jake Tapper, along with a flashing heart around his head (shown below). Hottest audience member at the #GOPDebate pic.twitter.com/HfJii0q6oS Sources differ on the origin of this meme. Buzzfeed has reported that the meme in response to a cease and desist received on September 4th, 2015 by the podcaster Alison Kilkenny, who records the podcast Citizen Radio with Jamie Kilstein.[1] Kilkenny tweeted that she had received a cease & desist for from Taylor Swift's legal team, despite having only discussed the star and recited some of her lyrics on the podcast, instead of actually playing a song.[2] Kilkenny was unclear as to why the cease & desist had been issued, but nonetheless she complied with the letter and removed the episode from iTunes. It had been previously reported [9] that in October of 2014 that Swift had copyrighted several phrases and lyrics from her hit record 1989, including: •"Party like it's 1989" •"This sick beat" •"Cause we never go out of style" •"Could show you incredible things" •"Nice to meet you. Where you been?" It is possible that Kilstein recited one of these copyrighted lyrics, thereby spurring the cease and desist, which caused the ridicule. However, other sources on Reddit claim a different source for the meme.[6] Later that month, on September 13th, 2013, Niall Horan of the boy band One Direction celebrated his 22nd birthday at a concert by beginning to sing Taylor Swift's song "22," stopping after a few lines and claiming that he didn't know the words;[4] according to Tumblr user taylorswiftandmisandry, a user on Instagram posted a video of this, captioning it (Taylor Swift™ No copyright infringement intended. Property of TAS LLC Management 2014©).[5] The first posts on Tumblr using the phrase showed up on the same day; some were directly referencing Horan's birthday.[3] The name "Trap Queen" is derived from the term "trap" or "trap house," which is often defined on Urban Dictionary[3][4] as a location for drug dealers to make and sell narcotics. In March 2014, rapper Fetty Wap released the song "Trap Queen" as his debut single, which contains lyrics proclaiming his affection for a girlfriend who assists him with drug dealing operations. On January 5th, 2009, YouTuber ThatsErapProductions uploaded a video titled "Top 10 Internet Memes and Phenomena – listverse lists," in which he pronounces the word "meme" as "may-may" (shown below). While Quiet originally made her first appearance in the VGA 2012 trailer of The Phantom Pain on December 10th, 2012,[1] the character later made her official debut in the E3 2013 trailer of Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain on June 10th, 2013 (shown below, left). Quiet is first encountered during the prologue of The Phantom Pain and later reappears in the 11th mission of the game where players are given the opportunity to recruit the sniper after defeating her in battle (shown below, right). The exact origin of the photo is unknown, although it began to pop up online on various photo blogs during the winter of 2013-2014.[1] The caption, an unrelated quote by Indian singer Dharmendra Rada, appeared on the photo during this time as well, and it's likely that the combination was first created on 4chan, although it hasn't been archived. The first instance of the photo posted online was on FunnyJunk on January 24th, 2014.[2] On September 9th, 2015, San Francisco-based graphic designer Shaun Osburn[1] and his partner Michael tweeted an image macro based on the X-Files protagonist Dana Scully with the caption praising the character's work ethics in the style of Good Guy Greg, along with a note to the actress Gillian Anderson asking for her reaction (shown below). On August 8th, 2010, Ebaumsworld[6] user UsedCarMan posted a screenshot of a Yahoo! Answers question question asking if anyone recalled a "penis inspection day" in elementary school. The original Yahoo! Answers post has not been found. The origin of smol is currently unknown, but it began appearing on social networks sometime between the late spring and early summer of 2015. An article on Buzzfeed used the term for the title of a list of small animals on May 8th, 2015,[8] but it's likely that the origin of the term's popularity was a fan reference to a musician named Tyler Josephs from the American musical group Twenty One Pilots. Fans began referring to Josephs as a "smol bean" on Tumblr and Twitter.[1] On June 26th, 2015, Josephs responded, "I am a bean."[2] The tweet received over 22,000 retweets and 33,00 favorites over the next two months, with many fans responding "A smol bean." In 1970, the term "microaggression" was coined by Harvard University professor Chester M. Pierce in reference to dismissive statements and insults directed toward African Americans. In 1973, the term was expanded by MIT economist Mary Rowe to include statements that could be viewed as insulting toward women. "Microaggression" eventually became a label for casual remarks that could be viewed as disparaging to any socially disadvantaged group.  Odell Beckham Jr's hair has been a subject of discussion online since his first year in the NFL playing for the New York Giants. On August 28th, 2014, it was announced that he signed an endorsement deal with shampoo brand Head & Shoulder's drawing even more attention to his hair.[1] In addition, during the summer of 2015, a photograph surfaced that was rumored to picture Beckham Jr performing cunnilingus on the model Amber Rose; Beckham Jr was recognizable, in theory, by his hair (view this image in the gallery).[2] He denied that the photo was of him by posting a photo of his more current hairstyle to Instagram with the caption "Pray the real last forever man, pray the fakes get exposed," a lyric from a song by Drake. The first collection of photos of was created by blogger Edith Zimmerman on January 3rd, 2011, on the feminist blog The Hairpin. The post was titled "Women Laughing Alone With Salad" and featured 18 photos illustrating the trend with no accompanying text. As of September 2015, the post has been shared on Facebook over 206,000 times and on Twitter 15,400 times, and it has 730 comments. In October 1964, Simon and Garfunkel released the song "The Sound of Silence" as a track on their debut studio album Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M., which features the lyrics "hello darkness, my old friend" in the first verse. Hello darkness, my old friend I've come to talk with you again Because a vision softly creeping Left its seeds while I was sleeping And the vision that was planted in my brain Still remains Within the sound of silence In May 2013, Season 4 of the American sitcom Arrested Development was released on Netflix, which contained several scenes featuring the song when the character Gob experiences a moment of deep regret (shown below). Following the season's release, search interest for the phrases "hello darkness" and "hello darkness my old friend" saw a dramatic spike on Google Trends. The original comic, titled "Baton roue" (French for "wheel stick"), was first published on Penloup's personal art blog on January 23rd, 2011.[1]  On November 7th, 2001, country singer Alan Jackson released the song "Where Were You When the World Stopped Turning," a memorial song about the September 11th, 2001 attacks months before. The song won the Grammy Award for Best Country Song in 2002 and Song of the Year from many different country music song associations. As of April 2015, the song has sold 368,000 digital copies in the United States.[1] On January 8th, 2010, MyJulia.ru[1] user VladEva posted a series of image about life in "Chechen-town." One of the images featured an elderly woman in a babushka smiling and point at the camera. The post (shown below) has been viewed by more than 3,800 people since. This very recent meme is thought to have been first posted on 4Chan, but it has since made rounds on Facebook, Instagram, and various forums. First posted some time between the end of August and September 8th, in 2015, the first post of the picture has not yet been pinpointed. As for the making of the picture itself, one Reddit user pointed out that it looks suspiciously like a plain old Snapchat photo that had been cropped. The user who first posted it is not known, as the original posting has not been found, therefore it is also not known which part of the world it originates from. The person featured in the picture has not been identified. Nina first appeared in Full Metal Alchemist's fifth chapter, The Alchemist's Suffering, released in December 2001.[5] In it, Edward and Alphonse Elric visit Shou Tucker, a chimeric alchemist who was able to create a chimera capable of human speech. They meet his daughter Nina and her dog, Alexander, and they become friends. Some days later, the brothers are informed by Shou that he had created another chimera able to speak. However, Ed realises the chimera contains both Nina and Alexander, and he beats Shou nearly to death when he admits it. Alphonse apologises to Nina, as they're not able to separate her and Alexander. After the brothers leave, Scar enters the house and kills both Shou and Nina, asking God to take care of their souls.[1] On March 17th, 2011, "NEW ACCOUNT – KAIROUZVISUAL" uploaded the death scene from the 2009 anime series to YouTube, gathering over 400,000 views in the following years. The exact origin of the phrase is unknown, however one of the earliest examples of its discussion online dates to 2006, when American actor Charlie Sheen stated it in an interview with InfoWars founder Alex Jones.[1] The original instance of the question was posted by user fwittt on the Microsoft TechNet forums in May of 2010,[1] and reads: I have a question, I recently took delivery of my new Dell, which came with the 32bit version of Windows 7, however the PC is capable of running at 64bit. If I install Windows 7 32bit twice would that make it 64bit? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Initially users took the question at face value, including a board admin who explained in detail why the question didn't make sense, but in addition, users began generating a series of ridiculous replies. The original question is in the top 5% most popular posts on the Windows support forum, with 250 points and 31 replies. The original source of the sound effect comes from Splatoon's inkling girl character, which first denuted on May 28th, 2015. Upon hitting the downward directional pad, or the "Booyah!" button, the player can hear the catchphrase, which was a common method of communication due to the game not including voice chat (seen below).[1] On July 3rd, 2015, SoundCloud user frozenpandaman uploaded the earliest-known voice command files for inkling girl featuring the signature "woomy" quote (shown below). On July 21st, 2015, Tumblr user sugaawaras[1] published a mock conversation in which he is chastised by a friend for repeatedly expressing his love for the character Sugawara Koushi from the anime series Haikyuu (shown below).

(shown below). On October 6th, 1998, the episode "Thomas and the Rumours" of Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends aired in the United Kingdom (clip below).[1] In the episode, Thomas worries that a helicopter named Harold will replace the trains. After telling his concerns to Sir Topham Hatt, the narrator (voiced by Alec Baldwin) says, "Sir Topham Hatt laughed, 'Well, the engines are wrong, and you shouldn't listen to them.'" On November 27th, 2014, Tumblr [2] user fxckbro posted the earliest available image of the meme. They captioned the post, "when someone tells u that u shouldnt eat so much pasta." The post received more than 800,000 notes in less than seven years (shown below). The quote originated from the 28th episode of season 3 of the American animated series Spongebob Squarepants, originally aired January 24th, 2003.[1] In the episode Mr. Krabs has a mid-life crisis, and Spongebob and Patrick attempt to return Mr. Krabs to his more youthful demeanor by taking him out for a night on the town. Throughout this experience, Spongebob repeatedly asks Mr. Krabs if he is feeling revived by saying, "Are you feeling it yet?"  In August 1998, the travel program Makłowicz w Podróży (English: Maklowicz on the Road) was first broadcast on the Polish television station TVP 2, featuring chef Robert Maklowicz touring various kitchens around the world (shown below, left).[1] On June 19th, 2014, YouTuber mitomtzw uploaded a video titled "EEEEEEE", which included clips from the show edited to sound as if Maklowicz is repeating the letter "e" (shown below, right). Over the next two years, the video gained over 650,000 views, 9,500 likes and 440 comments. On November 11th, 2001, King of the Hill aired the first episode of its sixth season, titled "Bobby Goes Nuts".[1] In the episode Bobby Hill enters into a woman's self-defense class where he learns to attack an assailant by kicking them in the groin and screaming the phrase.

On March 21st, 2013, the Dutch vegetable distributor Jansen-Dongen released a video[2] entitled "Malta Potatoes" which advertised the sources of their potatoes. The company said that the video was often used at conferences and other promotional opportunities where it was not always possible to view it with sound, hence the subtitles. The interview with the young farmer occurs at about 2:15 in the video. Since its posting, the original video has accrued over 321,000 views as of September 2015. A video with corrected subtitles, posted several months later, has accrued an additional 20,000 views.

During these moments, Elizabeth will occasionally shout "Booker, catch!".  On June 26th, 2002, Comedy Central aired an episode of American animated TV series South Park titled "Simpsons Already Did It," in which the recurring character Butters' alter ego "Professor Chaos" struggles to come up with an innovative scheme to take over the world as his assistant repeatedly reminds him that his ideas had been previously illustrated on an episode of The Simpsons.[1] On October 28th, 2010, the scene in question was uploaded online to YouTube. In a commentary video made by the South Park creators, they stated how the episode came to be after realising The Simpsons already beat them to a lot of ideas and jokes they had come up with for their own show[5], illustrating the widespread and lasting influence of The Simpsons on popular culture. On March 29th, 1998, Season 9 Episode 19 of The Simpsons titled "Simpson Tide" was broadcast, in which Homer Simpson joins the United States Navy Reserve after being fired from the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. When Simpson ends up on a submarine in Russian waters, a political controversy erupts resulting in the revelation that the Soviet Union never actually disbanded (shown below). Crossovers have been present in fiction work for decades, with one of the earliest known examples published in the French magazine Je Sais Tout in June 1906. Penned by French author Maurice Leblanc "Sherlock Holmes Arrives Too Late,"[5] was an unofficial crossover, pitting Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's famous detective against Leblanc's well-known character Arsène Lupin[6], the gentleman thief. When Doyle found out about the use of his character, he requested that the name in the story be changed to Herlock Sholmes in future publications to avoid a legal situation. The earliest known instance of pre-production footage from behind-the-scenes of a major Hollywood film was uploaded to YouTube by Øyvind Nilsen on March 26th, 2007, which featured the original green-screen rendition of the opening scene of the 2005 American neo-noir crime thriller film Sin City (shown below, left), before the application of special effects and grading during post-production (shown below, right). As of September 2015, the video clip has garnered over 524,000 views. Though the exact origin of these theories is unknown, it's believed that a precursor can be found on "Transstuck," a fanfiction and fanart trend featuring characters from the webcomic Homestuck as transgender individuals.[12] The earliest known archived usage of the phrase can be dated back to August 7th, 2008[4]. The picture, which was the basis for the original image macro, depicts the character Dungeon Master from the Dungeons & Dragons animated TV series, which aired in 1983-1985. The earliest archived use as a reaction image can be found in a post on 4chan's /a/ board made on December 21st, 2008.[1] In 2015, a massive series of anti-corruption and anti-government protests erupted in Brazil in the aftermath of a worsening economic crisis and an investigation of a political corruption scandal involving President Dilma Rousseff's Worker's Party and the state-owned oil company Petrobras. The protesters demanded the impeachment of president Dilma Rousseff and the end of the Worker's Party (PT) ruling.[2] The first wave of the protests, which began on March 15th, was attended by 2.4 million people.[3] A second protest on April 12th drew more than 700,000 people.[4] During the third protest on August 16th, which brought close to a million people together,[5] the organizers of Movimento Brasil (Brazil Movement) exhibited a 12 meters (39 feet) tall inflatable doll of Rousseff's predecessor, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, in the country's capital, Brasília.[1] The doll featured a caricature of Lula in black and white prison garb with a ball and chain around his ankle. The effigy was soon dubbed "Pixuleco," a reference to the codeword for "money" used by those implicated in the Petrobras corruption scandal. Lula, who ruled the country between 2003 and 2010, is currently being investigated for alleged influence peddling,[6] and his popularity has eroded ever since. On March 19th, 2015, several gaming news sites including Kotaku,[1] PC Gamer,[4] Polygon,[5] and Eurogamer[6] reported about the rumor that Hideo Kojima might be leaving Konami, among the evidence include the renaming of Kojima Productions Los Angeles into Konami Los Angeles Studio and the removal of Hideo Kojima's name from Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain's title on the official Konami website (shown below, top was before the change). On July 14th, 2015, a NeoGAF thread was submitted by user Love Deterrence that shows the final version of the official box art for Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain which reveals Kojima's brand being completely removed.[7] On April 21st, 2014, Instagram[4] user emilyrose920 posted a photograph of herself with her former husband in front of a painting of a bald eagle with the caption "'Can we take a divorce selfie?'" (shown below).  The original comic was created by the artist Slurpoof, and first submitted to her personal Tumblr blog on February 11th, 2013.[1] The comic despicts a girl asking Kyubey if she could wish that she could make more wishes, followed by a close up of Kyubey's face and the reply "that's not how it works you little shit". The post got over 10,000 notes in the following two years. On February 6th, 2011, an anonymous user on 4chan's /a/ (Anime & Manga) board started the meduka meguca series of threads, which would eventually have 5 episodes.[1][2] A few months later Youtube user foreverpandering began uploading a series of voiced episodes of the meduka meguca threads. At the end of the 5th and final episode, foreverpandering added a song remixing hip hop due M.O.P.'s 2000 radio hit Ante Up[4][5] with his voiced episodes. Although the episodes have since been removed following a takedown notice and foreverpandering's account has been deleted,[3] both the episodes (shown below, left) and the Ante Up remix (shown below, right) have been reuploaded to Youtube by others various times. Before the fighting game Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS was released, wild speculation about the game's cast of playable characters was very common. On August 20th, 2014, YouTube user EverythingSmash uploaded a video in which he supposedly leaked the entire roster. This video immediately came under scrutiny from the gaming community, where many viewers doubted its credibility. Several days later, YouTube user RelaxAlax analyzed the video in detail, explaining which parts he believed to be fake and why. One of the claims made in the video was that a render of the character Shulk, whose inclusion in the character list was not confirmed, greatly resembled an already confirmed character, Little Mac. This similarity led RelaxAlax to speculate that perhaps the Shulk image was a Photoshopped picture of Little Mac. The comparison can be seen in the video below, beginning at 13:11. While RelaxAlax's video racked up a significant number of views and caused many in the community to agree with his point of view, the game's release in Japan ultimately proved the entire leak as true. On March 3rd, 2014, the @RelatableQuote[4] Twitter feed posted a photograph of spaghetti noodles and sauce hidden inside a book with the tweet "when the teacher thinks ur studying but really you're eating spaghetti" (shown below). Over the next two years, the tweet gathered upwards of 5,700 favorites and 4,600 retweets. The original image that spawned the meme (shown below, left) was created by adding the phrase as a caption to a vectored image of the character of Twilight Sparkle taken from the show. The image in question (shown below, right) was submitted by DeviantArt user RyantheBrony on December 4th, 2011, titled "Twilight Wants a Hug".[1] The captioned variant was submitted to the MLP image hosting site Derpibooru on December 5th, 2012.[3] On January 16th, 2009, the video game news blog GamesRadar[2] published an article about various video game characters who were performed by the same voice actor.  In Turkish, kek means cake, and Topkek, a brand of cupcakes, was first produced in 1990 by ETi, a Turkish confectionery company.[1] In 2011, the television show Workaholics aired an episode in which the character Adam Demamp wears a hat embroidered with Top Gun, and as this phrase spread in use, one of the mutations incorporated the phrase kek, creating "Topkek." In May of 2013, an /s4s/ board user under the name "prime minister face" created a thread featuring the cake, which received over 6,000 replies before it was archived.[2] In 2014, the meme aggregator site Top Kek was created.[4] In Japanese Pornography and Hentai, the term "Kimochi" or "Kimochi ii" is often used by participants during sexual acts to express their enjoyment. The exact origin of No Chill is unknown but the phrase began appearing in this context online in 2013, when it was first defined on Urban Dictionary as "At this particular moment you’re being extremely reckless, as in That negro PJ has no chill the way he was talking about Brian's girl last night right in front of him."[sic]. This definition remains the top definition, with 730 upvotes and 231 downvotes between April 15th, 2013 and August 29th, 2015.[1] Aizen first appeared in chapter 79 of the manga,[1] and episode 23 of the anime.[2] Aizen is introduced as a kind and compassionate man who cares for those around him. However it is eventually revealed that Aizen is in fact a villain who has been manipulating events to his own favor. He soon becomes the main antagonist of the series until his defeat at the hands of protagonist Ichigo Kurosaki. The term "pansexualism" was originally coined by critics of psychologist Sigmund Freud in 1917, using the term as a pejorative for theories that all feelings of desire are manifestations of sexual instincts. The term was later used to describe a fluid sexual orientation not limited to any specific gender. On July 31st, 2003, Urban Dictionary[2] user saki submitted an entry for "pansexuality," defining it as "one who can love sexuality in many forms." Trick shots predate the Internet by several decades; some of the earliest known practices of trick shots are attributed to artistic pool,[1] a type of Billiards competition in which pool players perform trick shots to be judged both on creativity and skill, and the Harlem Globetrotters, a non-competitive basketball team known for its creative trick shots and entertaining play-throughs.[2] Online, the earliest known viral trick shot video was an artistic pool video uploaded on October 20th, 2006 by YouTuber WHOOMP.TV, which received over 11 million views as of August 2015. [3] In the Dragon Ball franchise, Power Level is a fictional measurement system used to assess and gauge the combat strength of a warrior numerically. According to Dragonball Wikia, the highest degree of power level ever gauged by a scooter in the saga is Captain Ginyu’s reading of Goku’s power level at 180,000. The highest power level ever referenced in Dragon Ball Z is Frieza’s power level of 530,000, said by Frieza himself while battling Nail. According to the Japanese manga publisher V-Jump, the overall highest power level is 2,500,000,000 of Super Saiyan Gogeta. The image most likely originated on 4chan at some point before 2009; on September 20th, 2009, the Tumblr "epic4chan", a blog dedicated to posting images from 4chan, uploaded the first known instance of the meme in a post titled "But that’s wrong you fucking retard (Bill Nye the Science Guy)".[1] The post featured a picture of prominent science educator Bill Nye looking at the viewer. According to an article on Slate[2] titled "The History of the Mic Drop," the practice of letting a microphone drop on stage was popularized by rappers and comedians in the 1980s. The earliest known example occurred during comedian Eddie Murphy's 1983 stand-up special Delirious, in which he drops the microphone on stage after a fan yells "Shut up bitch!" at a heckler (shown below, left). The earliest known reference to the practice in hip hop is contained within the 1987 track "I Ain't No Joke" by Eric B. & Rakim, in which Rakim raps "I used to let the mic smoke, now I slam it when I;m done and make sure it's broke" (shown below, right). The earliest known online mention of the drug was posted on the drug treatment blog Soberooms,[6] where it was listed as a "new designer drug of abuse" and described as "the latest street version of bath salts." On June 21st 2013, Tumblr user Juniorbizarre uploaded a hand-drawn parody comic as a tribute to Phineas and Ferb, directly photographed from the blogger's personal sketchbook. In the TV series, the older sister of the main characters, Cadance, tries to tell their mother of her brother's exploits, while in the fan comic many of the common features of episodes in the series are parodies or overblown. This posted gained over 275,000 notes in two years. [1] On June 28th of the same year, Juniorbizarre later posted the full comic in its entirety,[2] and said "this was just a silly thing i did quite a while ago to make myself laugh :D i’m so glad other people think it’s funny too omg". The artist also has also called it the "crumpets comic" in reference to another quote from the piece. Having likely originated on 4chan, the exact origin of the term is difficult to ascertain, though the earliest registered instance of the term can be found on an /a/ thread submitted on April 1st, 2011.[1] The first recorded example of "Brohoof" outside of 4chan was a set of definitions submitted to Urban Dictionary on May 30th, 2011,[2] defining the term as follows: n.) A high-five between two males who watch the show, My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, due to any aspect, win, meme, etc. regarding said television show. n.) A high-five between two ponies from the show, My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, with their hooves, respectively. v.) To exchange a celebratory high-five either as a pony or because of ponies. Severus Snape was introduced in the first Harry Potter book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's / Philosopher's Stone as the school's potions teacher and head of Slytherin. He is at first thought to be the main villain but later revealed to be a protagonist. Snape took a lesser role in the books until Half-Blood in which he in the book's latter kills Albus Dumbledore, the headmaster of Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. In the final book, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, this is later revealed to have been planned by Dumbledore to prevent the main villain, Voldemort, from claiming the Elder Wand, one of the three Deathly Hallows. Also in the final book, Snape is revealed to have been in love with Harry Potter's mother, Lily Evans / Potter. This is cited as the sole reason Snape protects Harry through his years and acts as a spy against Voldemort for Dumbledore. Snape dies late in the book being attacked by Voldemort's serpent, Nagini because Voldemort believes him to be the master of the Elder Wand and thus must be killed for the mastership to be transferred. On November 27th, 2012, Redditor mygoodness82 submitted a photograph of a American Airlines employee David Dolci standing at a ticketing counter at the New York La Guardia Airport to the /r/pics[6] subreddit (shown below).

The original scene comes from the fifth episode of the anime series, first aired on August 1st, 2015. In it, Anna Nishikinomiya prepares cookies for the characters Ayame Kajou and Tanukichi Okuma. After asking the latter about the cookies, she starts explaining how her "love feelings" for Tanukichi turn into liquid after reaching their peak, and then telling him she used her vaginal fluids (which Anna calls "love nectar" due her lack of knowledge on sexual subjects) to make his cookies. Later, on the same episode, Anna ambushes Tanukichi on their school and tries to force him into drinking a bottle full of her "love nectar". On August 18th, 1997, chapter 516 "The Boss' Last Orders" of the manga series JoJo's Bizarre Adventure was released in Weekly Shonen Jump.[1] In the issue, activity of the yet-unnamed stand King Crimson is first showcased.

Years later on May 5th, 2010, YouTuber JimmyWilson01 uploaded a video of the 1929 Disney short film The Skeleton Dance with "Spooky Scary Skeletons" edited in to play in the background (shown below). As of August 2015 the video has over 5.3 million views.[1]  The nasheed is believed to have been written by an anonymous ISIS member who goes by the pseudonym Abu Yasir[1] in affiliation with the group's propaganda recording label, the Ajnad Media Foundation (AMF). As the title "Clashing / Clanging Of The Swords"[10] suggests, the song calls upon its listeners to take up arms and "wage a war against the enemy." The song was first introduced as the musical accompaniment to the fourth installment of the ISIS propaganda video series with the same name, released via Twitter on March 17th, 2014.

On June 27th, 2015, Taiwanese blogger RainDog[1] uploaded a photograph of Wei Han Xu to PIxnet.com, which subsequently went viral across the social media outlets in the country. McDonald’s in Taiwan has a track record when it comes to cute girls. RainDog (Wei Han Xu's brother) has been taking photos and blogging[2] about the McDonald's staff cosplaying in maids outfits, sailor uniforms and other outfits, which has been met with positive reception since its beginning in December 25th, 2013. Xu has worked as a part-time server at McDonald's for five years and also works as a model and cosplayer in her free time. The exact origin of the use of the phrase is unknown, but it has been postulated that the use of "mango(s)" might have originated as mistranslations around the time when otaku culture began to become more widespread in Southeast Asia. In many Southeast Asian languages, the word for "mango" translates to "manga," which likely caused initial confusion, which in turn gave rise to an ironic use of the word both off and online.[1] At some point the term migrated to the west, most likely through either the Something Awful forums, or 4chan's /a/ board. On May 1st, 2005, Urban Dictionary user Area Denial posted a definition for "animu":  The precise origin of "Male Tears" as an image macro series remains unknown; however, the earliest instance on record comes from the French Tumblr blog FeministPicture in a post on August 25th, 2012. Titled "male tears," the post describes it as "a concept to make fun of men who whine about how oppressed they are, how hard life is for them, while they still are privileged"[1]. Titled "Decisive Battle on Kaiō's Planet! Goku vs. God of Destruction Beerus," the fifth episode of Dragon Ball Super aired on August 9th, 2015. Immediately following its broadcast, many viewers expressed their disappointment with the episode's exceptionally low quality production, particularly the climatctic battle sequence between Goku and Beerus. That same day, YouTuber Blues uploaded a video montage of screenshots from the fight scene while he sings the Dragon Ball Kai theme "Dragon Soul" in a very solemn tone (shown below). For many transgender people, part of the goal of transitioning is to "pass" or to be treated as if they are a member of their desired gender without people wondering if they previously had another gender. Many transgendered people since the beginning of the practice of transitioning (and the beginning of photography) have shown both "before" and "after" pictures of their transition, including historical transgender pioneers like Lili Elbe and Christine Jorgensen. The practice of exhibiting extensive documented timelines of transitions anecdotally began on the transgender board of the 420chan forum, although at this time it is not possible to identify individual posts of this type.[6] The first photo montage video of a transition was posted to YouTube by user xXGamerGirl148Xx on August 25th, 2010, and received over 679,000 views as of August 2015. During E3 on June 10th, 2013, Konami released an extended trailer for the game The Phantom Pain at a Microsoft panel discussion. Near the end of the trailer, the character Big Boss from previous games in the franchise is introduced with the alias "Punished Snake." On the following day, the trailer was uploaded to the Konami YouTube channel, where it gathered upwards of 1.9 million views over the next two years (shown below). On April 16th, 2015, Warner Bros. Pictures released the teaser trailer for the upcoming crossover film Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice, in which Batman (played by Ben Affleck) asks Superman (played by Henry Cavill) if he is capable of bleeding when hurt (shown below). On October 31st, 1996, the real-time strategy game Command & Conquer: Red Alert was released by Westwood Studios for the PC. The game's main theme titled "Hell March" was composed by musician Frank Klepacki, which was originally set to be the theme for the "Brotherhood of Nod" faction in an expansion for the 1995 real-time strategy game Command and Conquer (shown below). Variations of the theme were subsequently included in each game in the Red Alert series. The earliest instance of the catchphrase comes from a block thread on 4chan's video game board /v/, where users try to highlight some words or sections from video games covers by blocking parts of it. A post made on September 22nd, 2012 featured an edited version of the 2005 video game Shadow the Hedgehog cover, highlighting the words "OW THE EDGE".[3] The original image is crop of a picture from one of the pages in a Sesame Street storybook Just Like Ernie, published in 1988 by Western Publishing[1]. Though is unknown when exactly the original macro appeared, the earliest archived examples appear on 4chan's /jp/ board and date back to April 26th, 2009[2]. On September 11th, 2010, IGN member Kirby-Star started a thread titled "Google (Your Name) The Hedgehog"[1]. Most of the replies involved either a link to or an actual image of a fan-made character from the Sonic series sporting the user's first name. The thread led to 17 posts prior to being archived and is the earliest documented instance of the game. On August 29th, 2006, Urban Dictionary[1] user pfidr34 submitted an entry for "ghosting," defining it as "the act of disappearing on your friends without notice." The original phrase is a quote from the 1977 movie Star Wars, spoken by Obi-Wan/Ben Kenobi(Alec Guinness) after being stopped by Stormtroopers when traveling into the city of Mos Eisley in search of the smuggler Han Solo.[2] In the original line, the Jedi Obi-Wan uses the contracted form of "are not" and "you are." In 1991, the character Sonic the Hedgehog[1] was introduced as the titular character for the franchise. As additional games were released in the series, various allies and enemies were added to the games, including Tails the fox and Knuckles the echidna. Fans then began creating their own anthropomorphic animal characters in the Sonic universe using similar art styles. Captain Tsubasa (Japanese: キャプテン翼 Kyaputen Tsubasa), also known as Flash Kicker, is a popular long-running Japanese manga, animation, and video game series, originally created by Yōichi Takahashi in 1981. The series mainly revolves around the sport of Association football.[2] Captain Tsubasa is better known as Supercampeones in Latin America, and as Campeones: Oli y Benji in Spain.[3] This anime was massively popular in both regions, and inspired prominent footballers such as Hidetoshi Nakata, Alessandro Del Piero, Fernando Torres, Zinedine Zidane, Lionel Messi, Alexis Sánchez and Andrés Iniesta to play football and choose it as a career.[4] The exact website where this particular template originated is unknown, as is the origin of the widespread myth of the "legless Oliver". However, Google Trends makes it clear that the myth appeared around 2007, because no references to Tsubasa/Oliver being a leg amputee are available at earlier dates. As the United States Air Force's only ground-attack aircraft that has been deployed in several major military operations spanning over almost four decades of its operational history, most notably in the Gulf War, Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq War, the A-10 has long been celebrated by aviation enthusiasts and military personnels for its durability, versatility and effectiveness in combat. In gaming culture, the aircraft has been featured in more than 48 titles on various platforms, beginning with the release of the PC military flight simulator A-10 Tank Killer in 1989. In 2010, blogger Fiona Broome coined the term "Mandela Effect" to describe a collective false memory she discovered at the Dragon Con convention, where many others believed that former South African President Nelson Mandela died during his imprisonment in the 1980s. That year, Broome launched the site MandelaEffect.com[1] to document various examples of the phenomenon. Additionally, Broome described other widely held false memories, including various nonexistent Star Trek episodes and the death of the Reverend Billy Graham.  On February 16th, 2012, the 30 Rock episode "The Tuxedo Begins" (season six, episode 8). In the show, actor Steve Buscemi plays Lenny Wosniak, a private detective hired as a strike buster.[1] In a scene where Wosniak is describing his prior investigations, he flashes back to a scene where he believes he successfully masqueraded as a high school student, parodying the TV show 21 Jump Street.[12] Buscemi, a 55-year-old at the time the episode aired, approaches a group of high school teens dress as a "one of them." However, his grizzled appearance in contrast with his silly approximation of high school attire, which includes a backwards hat, a skateboard worn over his shoulder and a t-shirt that reads "Music Band" in the style of the classic AC/DC logo, is indicative of his poor and obvious disguise. As he approaches, he says, "How do you do, fellow kids?" The catchphrase has since come to represent all egregious attempts at appealing to subcultures. The original phrase is taken from the fourteenth episode of the first season of MLP, "Suited For Success", in which Rainbow Dash says the phrase in response to her friend Rarity asking for feedback on a dress design.[1] On August 10th, 2015, Sonic Dreams Collection was released as a free download by the indie game development studio Arcane Kids on the Tumblr blog "Hedgehod Exposed",[1] claiming that the games had been leaked by a hacker group who discovered the files inside a Sega Dreamcast developer kit. On August 12th, Tom Brady appeared at a public hearing in a New York City courtroom to discuss a potential settlement with the NFL regarding his involvement in Deflategate and the penalty of a four-game suspension. During the proceedings, several sketches of the both parties were drawn by New York City courtroom sketch artist Jane Rosenberg, one of which featured a moody and self-resigned looking portrait of Tom Brady. At 10:11 a.m. (EST), Boston-based reporter Jim Armstrong[16] for CBS-affiliate WBZ tweeted the images of Brady from the courthouse. On August 10th, 2015, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch posted an interview with a 19-year-old student Lexi Kozhevsky, who defended police officers against demonstrators in Ferguson, Missouri, claiming "I would rather get hit by something than let it hit them" (shown below). That evening, Lynden Steele, the director of photography at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, tweeted a picture of Kozhevsky standing in front of a row of police officers during the protests (shown below).[1] In the tweet, Steele noted that Kozhevsky was attempting to protect the officers from objects thrown by demonstrators (shown below). In the first 24 hours, the tweet received upwards of 2,200 retweets and 2,100 favorites. On July 20th, 2015, Indiana University student Keirra Santillan uploaded a Vine video clip of an unsuspecting child getting scooped up and carried away for a few seconds by a gyrating soft-foam beam while playing in an inflatable castle at the Indiana Black Expo in Indianapolis, Indiana. The original Vine clip accrued more than 20 million views within the first three weeks of upload. On May 14th, 2014, YouTuber DennisCeeTV uploaded a video titled "Selling Marijuana in the Hood Prank," in which he says "it's just a prank" when a victim pushes him for soliciting his table (shown below). In the next 15 months, the video gathered upwards of 1.1 million views and 650 comments. Je suis monté is tightly related to a mounting mechanic introduced in Monster Hunter 4, first released in September 2013 in Japan on Nintendo 3DS. With the introduction of new maps featuring more rugged areas, hunters are now able to perform aerial attacks on monsters by using their weapons after jumping off a ledge. Such attacks can stun a monster, allowing the last hunter who successfully dealt such an attack to mount it. While mounting, the hunter can complete a mini-game to topple the creature upon success. While regular gameplay can also topple a monster, the opening created after mounting it lasts much longer, allowing hunters to efficiently attack the weak point(s) of their giant enemy for massive damage. In multiplayer gameplay, mounting can be cancelled if a member of the party keeps on hitting the monster being mounted to the point of triggering a new stun animation which throws the mounting hunter away. The whole mounting system is illustrated in the video below. However, Je suis monté actually appeared with a more complete version of Monster Hunter 4, Monster Hunter 4G, which has been initially released in September 2014 in Japan on Nintendo 3DS. The game eventually hit the stores in Northern America and Europe in February 2015 as Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate. In multiplayer sessions, to avoid unfortunate outcomes while mounting a monster, the mounting hunter typically sends a message to other players with the game's own chat to prevent them from interfering. A default message for such a case is available in all versions, the French message being "Je suis monté". On June 8th, 2009, a "'paranormal pictures" photoshop contest was launched on the Something Awful (SA) Forums.[1] The contest required participants to turn ordinary photographs into creepy-looking images through digital manipulation and then pass them on as authentic photographs on a number of paranormal forums. Something Awful users soon began sharing their faux-paranormal creations with layered images of ghosts and other anomalies, usually accompanied by a fabricated witness account to make them more convincing. On June 10th, SA user Victor Surge (real name Eric Knudsen) posted two black and white photographs of unnamed children with a short description of "Slender Man" as a mysterious creature who stalked children.[2] On June 11th, 2009, Victor Surge continued to improve upon the myth by adding another picture and a fake doctor's account.[3] The following day, SA user LeechCode5[4] posted a photograph of a burning building with a Slender Man back story. On June 14th, SA goon TrenchMaul[6] reused the Slender Man character for his own story. The original thread, which still remains active today, extends for 46 pages as of June 2011. "Through the Fire and Flames" was recorded by DragonForce in 2005 and was released on January 9th of following year by Roadrunner Records as part of the album Inhuman Rampage[1]. The single of "Through the Fire and Flames" was released on August 3rd, 2006. A video version of the song, slightly shorter than the original, was uploaded to YouTube on December 26, 2006, and has since gained nearly 70 million views. [2] The song gained an increase in popularity after it appeared as a bonus track in the Guitar Hero game: Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock in October of 2007. [7] The song is unlocked after the player finishes the game at any difficulty level. It is considered to be one of the most difficult songs in the Guitar Hero Games series (and by many to be the most difficult).[3][4][5] The song was listed as the fourth top Video Game Villain of 2007 by Game Informer.[9] The song was also later released as a DLC for the Rock Band series of video games. Flutterbat had made her debut in the episode "Bats!" in season 4, which was released in December of 2013. After fruit bats had infested Sweet Apple Acres, AppleJack asked for help from her friends Twilight Sparkle and FlutterShy, but Twilight's spell had backfired and caused FlutterShy to become a fruit bat herself, craving nothing but apples. On November 22nd, 2003, the Tribe Forums[1] user cdub uploaded a photograph of a shirtless, overweight man with the caption "14/f/cali" (shown below).  The Red Band trailer of Straight Outta Compton was released on February 8th, 2015, and will be released on theaters on August 14, 2015. The film shows the rise to popularity and disbandment of the 1990s rap group N.W.A. (Niggaz Wit Attitudes). The title of the biopic film was borrowed from their debut album of the same name.[1] On July 23th, 2015, a promotional site for the film named Straight Outta Somewhere was created as an image generator based on the film's logo. The images made from it can be saved and shared via Facebook and Twitter.[2] While the exact origin of the initialism is unknown, the online slang term likely originated with the rise of IRC chat rooms in the 1980s and became widespread through its usage on instant messaging services like AOL Instant Messenger and MSN Messenger in the 1990s. In March 2002, “ASL” was added to the Internet Acronyms Dictionary.[4] The first face occurs in the episode "Daring Don't"[1] in season four, released in December of 2013, after Rainbow Dash overhears the main villain Ahuizotl and eponymous character Daring Do exchanging taunts before they begin to fight over the possession of a critical plot device. The second face originates from the proceeding episode, "Flight To The Finish".[4] The earliest known use of the phrase in a sexual context was posted on the alternative sex story site, asstr.org, on March 8th 2002.[1]  The earliest known use of the phrase "It's this thread again" in an online discussion was posted by DIYAudio Forums[1] member SteveCallas, on December 5th, 2006, when replying to a thread regarding subwoofer loudspeakers. On August 6th, 2015, TIME unveiled the cover for their upcoming issue focusing on virtual reality technology and the Oculus Rift device (shown below).[1] Additionally, the official Twitter account for TIME then tweeted an animated version of the cover.[2] That same day, Twitter user Ryan Evans[10] tweeted a photoshopped image featuring a cut out of Luckey riding a horse in the middle of a field (shown below). Within 24 hours, the tweet gained over 200 retweets and 200 favorites. On August 6th, 2015, former governor of Texas and the second-time Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry participated in the Republican Party's first primary-stage debate for the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Upon being asked about his policy plans on immigration reform, Perry took the unusual path of taking a critical tone with Ronald Reagan, one of the most revered politicians of American conservatives in recent memory, by tracing the root of the issue back to the legislation of Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 under the late Republican president's administration: “For 30 years this country has been baited with half-hearted measures designed to lower the number of undocumented immigrants in the United States," he said. “All the way to when Ronald Raven signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people and the border is still not secure.”   On July 26th, 2015, the Indonesian doujin circle Spring Roll posted two illustrations of an anthropomorphic character embodying the country's web content-filtering service, which was subsequently nicknamed "Ipo-chan" on its offical Facebook page.[1] Seandainya Internet Positif ada versi Gijinkanya :3 namanya I.Po-chan , hobinya blokir website. luarnya kliatan galak, tapi sebenarnya bullyable ( &#x361;&#xb0; &#x35c;&#x296; &#x361;&#xb0;) The original design of Ipo-chan is credited to Indonesian illustrator and DeviantART user Rouzille Erzabalna.[10] According to Jurnal Otaku's interview with Rouzille Erzabalna,[2] the artist originally conceived the idea behind Ipo-chan shortly after Tifatul Sembiring, then-the Minister of Communication and Information of Indonesia who had overseen the implementation of filters for online censorship across the country, stepped down from his office in October 2014.[9] However, Rouzille didn't publicly unveil the character until after seeing the positive feedback over another Gijinka of two popular Indonesian instant noodle brands created by pixiv user Valoreins.[3] On August 10th, 2015, Spring Roll submitted a full biography for Ipo-chan on their facebook page.[16] The worm video was first posted to Tumblr sometime during the spring of 2014. The original post has been deleted, but a post by user unacclimated, reblogged from the original poster, received over 75,000 notes by August 2015.[1] In September 1966, the American television series Mission: Impossible premiered on the CBS network, which featured an original theme song composed by Lalo Schifrin. In 1967, the theme reached the #41 position on the Billboard Hot 100.  On November 1st, 2014, Snoop Dogg posted a selfie of himself wearing a hair wrap with the caption reading "Somebody make a meme out of this pic" to his Instagram account,[1] accruing over 14,400 likes and more than 900 comments. In the following months, the rapper continued to express his fascination with the meme subculture by sharing a series of similarly captioned selfies and image macros referencing a variety of internet memes.  In April 2011, the fangame "Derpy Delivery" by Grit was uploaded to his now-defunct Hamalonesandwich website, and showcased on fansite Equestria Gaming [1]. The original Derpy sprites from this game [2] would serve as the basis for the sprites of Desktop Ponies. The Desktop Ponies project began on Ponychan's /collab/ board later that year, before temporarily moving to its own website, and also spawning a DeviantArt [3] group run by the application's main developers and artists. In 1954, Russian artist Viktor Ivanovich Govorkov created the propaganda poster as part of an anti-alcohol campaign launched following the death of Soviet Union dictator Joseph Stalin (shown below, left). It is unclear when the poster became the subject of a photoshop meme. On January 22nd, 2009, the earliest known examples were featured in a post on the Russian Internet news blog Net Lore[5] (shown below, middle, right). The phrase is taken from media from the first generation[1] of the My Little Pony franchise, made by Hasbro between 1981 and 1992. A compilation of MLP-related songs[2] including one titled "Applejack's Song", released as a mail order disc or cassette in the United Kingdom, spawned both the phrase and the music typically associated with it. The scene used in the Vines comes from the intro to a parody commercial titled "Jones' Good Ass BBQ & Foot Massage" by Big Dog Eat Child, first posted to YouTube on April 16th, 2009. The commercial has since gained over 4 million views in under 7 years.  YouTuber Megaman765 with about 37,000 subscribers, uploaded a video titled "Super mario 64 Bloopers" on September 20, 2006. To this day, it has over 400,000 views, about 700 comments, and 1000 likes. While the term 'razzle dazzle' has been coined since the 1950's,[1] the most likely origin of the meme is from the award-winning 2002 musical film Chicago (a remake of the 1975 theater musical of the same name) where a song titled "Razzle Dazzle" featured bold, flashy dance sequences and the specific lyric, "Give em' the ol' razzle dazzle."[2] The term "cultural Marxism" is believed to have been coined by American sociology professor Trent Schroyer in his 1973 The Critique of Domination: The Origins and Development of Critical Theory, in which the author identifies the Frankfurt School's critical theory, a school of thought focusing on reflective assessment and cultural critique through application of social sciences, as the origin of a "culture industry" that imposes "socially unnecessary constraints of human freedom" and ultimately, the social domination of the individual. “As advanced industrial societies developed, the individual was more integrated into and dependent upon the collectivity and less able to utilize society for active self-expression.” In the following decades, Schroyer's critique of the Frankfurt School as the origin of postwar liberal agendas and destruction of individualism was further expounded upon by other mainstream academics, most notably Richard Weiner's Cultural Marxism and Political Sociology (1981) and Michael Minnicino's New Dark Age: Frankfurt School and 'Political Correctness' (1992). Vocal fry was first identified in the 1970s. Some authorities consider it a dysphonia, or vocal defect, if the speaker uses it consistently or can't speak without it, but it is also used in singing as a legitimate technique for lowering the vocal register.[1] In the early 2010s, linguists noted that the speech pattern was becoming more common among young English-speaking women, and performed several different studies about the perception of its use. One study claimed that "Relative to a normal speaking voice, young adult female voices exhibiting vocal fry are perceived as less competent, less educated, less trustworthy, less attractive, and less hirable," but another study found that they were perceived as "educated, urban-oriented, and upwardly mobile."[2][3] In December, 2011, the Daily Mail wrote a widely-read story about the prevalence of vocal fry in speech, attributing its popularity to the pattern's use by celebrities, including Britney Spears and Kim Kardashian.[4]  In November 2012, the @craigslistlove[1] Twitter feed was launched, which included the description "Wisdom from posts found mostly in the personals section of craigslist.org." Over the next several years, the account gained over 52,400 followers and posted over 6,700 tweets. in 2010, My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic premiered. Applejack debuted in the first episode in which she and her farm was assigned a catering gig for the Summer Sun Celebration. She introduced her (extended) family in the episode as well She is voiced by Ashleigh Ball in Friendship is Magic The dog was born in March 2015 in Edmonton, Canada, where she lives with her caretakers Christine Park and her boyfriend Dave Ngu. On May 31st, Park created an Instagram account for Tonkey with a portrait photograph of her, garnering more than 183,000 followers over the course of the next two months. In many online games, players advertise their willingness to purchase in-game items in trade channels or populated areas. According to a post in the /r/OutOfTheLoop[1] subreddit, players in the game Runescape often had in-game girlfriends which many speculated were actually men masquerading as women to scam users for gold and items. The "buying gf" expression was subsequently invented as a joke to mock the online relationships.  Cross-stitching is the oldest form of embroidery in the world, and has often been used to illustrate contemporary events through history.[1] In modern times, software has become available to assist in creating cross-stitch patterns out of every day images; there are several such programs, some of which are free and open source, like C-Stitch.[2] With a pattern, cross stitching is extremely simple, which has led to its enduring popularity. In recent years, the Maker and Crafting movements have led to a resurgence in the popularity of cross stitch, especially for funny and unique purposes.[3] The original scene comes from chapter 64 of the JoJo's manga, released on March 28th, 1988, which takes place during the events of Part 2, Battle Tendency.[1] In the scene, the Nazis are guarding the site of the sleeping Pillar Men, the Part 2's antagonists, and are trying to subdue them. One of them, named Wamuu, awakens from his slumber, kills the Nazis and after uttering the quote, awakens the rest of Pillar Men, Esidisi and Kars (seen below).[2] The scene was popular within the J_oJo's Bizarre Adventure_ community for years, with the earliest known archived mentions of it dating back to February 21, 2008.[3] On January 11th, 2013, the scene gained even more popularity due to the release of episode 14 of Part 2's anime adaptation.[4] Here, it was featured alongside a song during the awakening scene, named "Awake" or "The Pillar Men Theme,"[5] and became associated with the Pillar Men and quote since (shown below).   Bart Simpson was launched along with the rest of The Simpsons family in 1987. In the early 1990s, a fan trend called "Bartmania" took hold; millions of types of merchandise were sold, much of it featuring unauthorized, fan-drawn images of Bart. An Entertainment Weekly article from the time estimates that more than $200 million worth of Bootleg Bart merchandise had already been sold, and the popularity of The Simpsons didn't peak until seven years later, in 1997.[1] Bootleg Bart merchandise has always been sought out by collectors and acknowledged by people involved with the production of The Simpsons, as in a 2009 issue of the comic book "Treehouse of Horror."[8] However interest in the phenomenon became popular online with the debut of a single-topic blog devoted to the phenomenon, run by an anonymous person known only as Leo.[2] The blog began as a Facebook page and expanded into other platforms, eventually spawning its own web site.[3] In 2014, in an interview with Vice Magazine, Leo explained that he began collecting the shirts in 2003, but that much of what is on the blog comes from the readers who send in images of their own.[4] The myth is believed to have began at the now defunct Japanese free enquete/voting generating service known as the Automatic Enquete Generator or 自動アンケート作成. The phrase "30-Year-Old Male Virgin becomes Wizard" became popular among users of the service around as early as the year 2001. After the service shut down on May, 2002, the phrase was picked up by other Japanese online communities such as Futaba Channel. The earliest known recorded mention of the legend on the Western net was in an Urban Dictionary[5] entry submitted on December 21st, 2008. In the definition, user momo1212 defined the term "wizard" as "a person who never lost his virginity over 25 years." The precursor to the phrase first appeared in 2001 X-Men storyline "Eve of Destruction." Magneto is believed to be killed protecting Genosha, a mutant utopia destroyed by sentinels. He left behind recordings of his supposed last moments, in which he talks about his ideals, including mutant superiority. Because of this, mutants worldwide considered Magneto a martyr.[1] In the 2003 X-Men series, written by Grant Morrison, a rebellious student at Xavier's School For Gifted Mutants named Quentin Quire, wore a T-shirt with the phrase "Magneto Was Right", similar in design to that of the famous Che Guevara T-shirts.  The exact coinage of the term "cuckservative" is unknown, but its first recorded uses were in posts to the /pol/ board of 4chan, where combining the term "cuck" with different words for portmanteaus is common. The earliest known instance of use on /pol/ took place on September 26th, 2014, when a user created this post in response to another anon complaining about attending a conservative conference.[1] The "For Really Big Mistakes" eraser is a novelty eraser made by Toysmith. The images used for the basic meme template can be found on the Amazon product page[1] (shown below, left) and the eBay product page[2] (shown below, right). One of the earliest iterations of the two pictures as a meme came from Funnyism user Gasolineflavoredgum. On May 31st, 2015, Gasolineflavoredgum posted a picture of the eraser being used on a picture of a baby (shown below).[6] On June 8th, 2015, Redditor Do1717 submitted a photograph of Earl to the /r/aww subreddit, where the post garnered more than 5,180 points (96% up votes) and over 500 comments. That same day, a subreddit devoted to Earl was launched at /r/EarlThePuggle. In July 2015, a page titled "FemCon" was created on the e-commerce platform Sellfy,[1] which sold $50 tickets for an event described as a feminist-themed conference to be held in late August in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York City (shown below). It is unknown what film or television show first featured the ability for computers to zoom and enhance a photograph or video. An early example of improbably blowing up a photo from film negative occurred in the 1948 film Call Northside 777 (below left). Realistic film enhancement situations, where the exposures get blurrier as they are enlarged, have formed the plots of several films, most notably the 1966 thriller Blow-Up. However, one of the earliest known examples of computer involvement, as well as the first to use the term "enhance", is from the 1982 Ridley Scott science fiction film Blade Runner (below right). In the famous scene, Deckard (Harrison Ford), repeatedly asks a computer to zoom and enhance a photograph.[1] At the end of the scene, he tells the computer to "give him a hard copy" of the enhanced image. Since this film is supposed to take place in a fictional Los Angeles in the year 2019, in 1982 this usage of the technique was not perceived as immediately ridiculous. On January 15th, 2012, an illustration of the character Rainbow Dash by MLP: FiM storyboard artist Sabrina Alberghetti[1] was uploaded to the MLP fanart site Deeriboo.ru[2] (shown below, left). On February 11th, DeviantArtist PikachuX1000[3] uploaded a colored and vectored image of Rainbow Dash based on a cropped portion of Alberghetti's illustration (shown below, right).    The GIF was invented in 1987 at Compuserv, and developers there noted early that the pronunciation was "Jif." Indicating that the debate over its pronunciation has existed since the beginning of the format; In 1990, in the manual for a Compuserv graphics display program called Compushow, the developers wrote[2]: Compushow originally shipped with this GIF of Bob Berry, one of the original programmers. Using the software editor GIF89, which came with Compushow, one could open this image in a way where text was displayed on top of the graphics. This text included the line, "Oh, incidentally, it's pronounced "JIF"! This message can still be seen if a user opens this image with a text editor and views the original encoding.[1] Compuserv developers have also often been attributed with the song parody "Choosy developers choose GIF," as both a way of promoting the format and informing users of the proper pronunciation. In 2013, when receiving his Webby Award Lifetime Achievement Award, the creator of the GIF, Steve Wilhite, fueled the flames of the debate by reinforcing his original claim that the word was pronounced JIF. Opposition to the soft G pronunciation usually cites the acronym itself as the reason for using a hard G, i.e., one does not pronounce graphics with a "j" sound. BAN•ZELDA was first stated by a user who goes by the name "Patch" on Nintendo's social networking site, Miiverse. It first started after a Super Smash bros. for Wii U match, which Patch lost to a Zelda while playing online. He then changed his tag to "BAN•ZELDA" in frustration to losing to the character, Zelda, and suggesting she should be banned from online play.  On January 15th, 2015, Scoopla Movies reported on leaked images of Indominus Rex, a hybrid dinosaur that acts as the main antagonist in Jurassic World[1]. In late January, 2015, the official Jurassic World website released a profile of the dinosaur, complete with a silhouette of the creature[2]. The creature's design received criticism for being too generic despite being promoted as a hybrid dinosaur. On February 2nd, 2015, Paleo Artist Brian Engh launched the hashtag #buildabetterfaketheropod via his twitter account which aims to encourage other Paleo artists to create a more appealing hybrid dinosaur. "We've cloned something from a side branch of the #coeleurosaur #dinosaur clade…" #buildabetterfaketheropod pic.twitter.com/AC2bicI78j Big Band was first revealed as apart of the Skullgirls Encore Indiegogo[3] campaign as a stretch goal $375,000 and was successfully funded shortly after the Kickstarter began. On April 18th, 2014, the PlayStation Youtube channel uploaded Big Band's trailer and has gained over 130,000 views (shown below). Big Bang was added to the game on April 22nd, 2014. The blockbuster move Satchmo Solo is a reference to Louis Armstrong[4].  Thalassophobia is a portmanteau of "thalass" ("sea" in Greek) and "phobia" ("fear" in Greek). The earliest known use of the term in the context of fan art was in the title of a sea monster illustration by Deviantartist spyroteknik,[1] originally uploaded to the site on June 25th, 2003 (shown below).  On July 18th, 2015, redditor YungDemon created a post in the subreddit /r/aww titled, "Came home to my roommates dog protecting my kitten from the loud thunder and lightning outside" which featured two photographs, below.[1] In the second photo, taken mid-yawn, the dog's mouth is wide open and its eyes are popping out of its skull. According to the poster, the dog is a mutt breed from a local shelter. The post received 5,884 points (98% upvoted) in the first three days after it was posted. The history of Pepsi man starts back in the 1990's, where his design is attributed to the Canadian artist Travis Charest. from 1994 to 2000, Pepsi man would be featured in 12 Pepsi commercials. In the commercials, they would show people who were craving for a soda, with Pepsi man appearing to give the people Pepsi. Usually after delivering Pepsi to the people, Pepsi man would be involved in some sort of injury.  On December 18th 2009, Gawker's science and futurist blog io9 writer Annalee Newitz wrote a lengthy article about racial issues and white privilege surrounding the 2009 blockbuster hit Avatar[1]. As discussion grew in the comment section of the article, one user who goes by the handle Moff (a.k.a Josh Wimmer) posted a reply that would be deleted later on. It read as follows: Now, that doesn’t mean you have to think about a work of art. I don’t know anyone who thinks every work they encounter ought to only be enjoyed through conscious, active analysis -- or if I do, they’re pretty annoying themselves. And I know many people who prefer not to think about much of what they consume, and with them I have no argument. I also have no argument with people who disagree with another person’s thoughts about a work of art. That should go without saying. Finally, this should also go without saying, but since it apparently doesn’t: Believe me, the person who is annoying you so much by thinking about the art? They have already considered your revolutionary “just enjoy it” strategy, because it is not actually revolutionary at all. It is the default state for most of humanity. So when you go out of your way to suggest that people should be thinking less -- that not using one’s capacity for reason is an admirable position to take, and one that should be actively advocated -- you are not saying anything particularly intelligent. And unless you live on a parallel version of Earth where too many people are thinking too deeply and critically about the world around them and what’s going on in their own heads, you’re not helping anything; on the contrary, you’re acting as an advocate for entropy. And most annoyingly of all, you’re contributing to the fucking conversation yourselves when you make your stupid, stupid comments. You are basically saying, “I think people shouldn’t think so much and share their thoughts, that’s my thought that I have to share.” If you really think people should just enjoy the movie without thinking about it, then why the fuck did you (1) click on the post in the first place, and (2) bother to leave a comment? If it bugs you so much, GO WATCH A GODDAMN FUNNY CAT VIDEO. On December 21st, Racialicious writer Latoya Peterson quoted Moff's rant in its entirety, dubbing it "Moff's Law"[2] as a principle in defense of the very nature of media criticism. The phrase is taken from the introduction song of the G3.5 series of My Little Pony, the version that came before the current incarnation, Friendship is Magic. In a similar manner to the FiM intro, it briefly describes each of the main characters of the show and includes the line "Rainbow Dash always dresses in style". Due to the fact that the G4 variant of Rainbow Dash is depicted as tomboyish and wholly disinterested in fashion, a still frame of the opening animation captioned with the lyrics is frequently used to troll G4 fans. The original comic was published by the site Safely Endangered[1] under the title "Oh Bother" on July 5th, 2013 (shown below). On July 11th, 2015, a gallery was uploaded to Imgur[1] containing 32 image macros of sports referees calling out various logical fallacies, which credited film critic Glen Welch as the creator of the series. Within two weeks, the gallery received more than 230,000 views. On July 22nd, 2014, YouTuber Cassy Athena uploaded an episode of the web series Thru The Lens,[1] which features a day in the life of Nick Young. During the show, Young makes a perplexed facial expression when his mother claims he was "a clown" in his younger years (shown below, left). A screen capture of the scene was subsequently circulated online (shown below, right). On April 30th 2015 Jontron uploaded a video to channel called Jontron Whereabouts! In the video he tells the viewers that the reason for his absence was because he was working on a secret project. This was the first clue to Starcade and his first upload in two months On May 4th 2015 Jontron uploaded a video called JonTron's StarCade – Official Trailer announcing the miniseries Starcade. the video showed clips from filmed Starcade episodes and some game footage from Star Wars games. It has also been pointed out by fans that the video was uploaded on National Star Wars day (May 4th). On May 9th the first episode of Starcade was uploaded to YouTube showing of Star wars Atari 2600 games. The plot is that JonTron finds himself on the Millennium Falcon forced to play Star Wars Games for Darth Vader. In 2005, American confectionery company Jelly Belly introduced a new line of jelly bean products branded Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans[1], named after a fictional jelly bean-like product that appears in the Harry Potter universe, as part of the promotional marketing campaign for the fourth installment in the franchise, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. In keeping with the canonical description, each packaged unit is comprised of a mixture of the original Jelly Belly flavors and some new and unpleasant flavors disguised in original flavor colors (shown below, left). In 2008, Jelly Belly released a similar line of products called BeanBoozled[2] with nearly a dozen of new, odd flavors (shown below, right)  The line was originally spoken in the 1999 film Office Space, in a scene where main character Peter Gibbons is talking about how he can't be in the office because it's making him too upset. A female temp worker comes up behind him as he's talking and says, "Uh oh. It looks like somebody's got a case of the Mondays" in a childish and rude tone.[1] The term was first defined on Urban Dictionary in 2004,[2] but evidence suggests that online usage far predates that origin; The first documented use on Usenet was in 2000, less than a year after the film's original release.[3] The phrase was coined by English journalist Helen Lewis on her Twitter account[1] on August 9th, 2012 (shown below). As of July 2015, the tweet has gained around 800 retweets and 700 favorites. As a law, it has been rephrased as follows: On June 7th, 2015, Twitter user @neptunecutie[1] tweeted a photograph of Queen Elizabeth wearing a light green outfit with the caption "I hate people who dress like this… we get it, you smoke weed" (shown below). Within two months, the tweet gained over 21,400 favorites and 13,900 retweets. On May 28th, 2015, the 88th Scripps National Spelling Bee was held at the Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center in National Harbor, Maryland. During the competition, Louisville, Mississippi teenager Dev Jaiswall placed 5th after incorrectly spelling the word "iridocyclitis." The following day, Viner Fails of Vine uploaded a short clip of Jaiswal repeating the word "iridocyclitis" (shown below). The origin of the onomatopoeic expression is unknown. The earliest Urban Dictionary[1] entry for "whoosh" was submitted by userCougarSW2 on November 14th, 2004, defining it as an indication "that the joke just told was too sophisticated for the listener and has gone 'way over their head'." This Is Just To Say was first published by William Carlos Williams in 1934. It is considered a canonical work of Imagist poetry.[1] The original text is as follows: According to New York Magazine,[2] parodies of the poem date back to at least the 1960s, with Kenneth Koch's "Variations on a Theme by William Carlos Williams."[9] Koch would go on to advocate using "This is Just to Say" as a teaching tool in his 1970 book Wishes, Lies, and Dreams: Teaching Children to Write Poetry[10] where he offered the poem as a model that young poets could riff off of to improve their skills. The first early evidence of parody being written online is an allusion to a thread that existed on the "Straight Dope" message board, but was deleted in 2002. [2][3] The original user of this technique is unknown; it's possible that this manually edited version of Texas Hold'em, seen below left, was the first, as it dates back to September 11th, 2013.[1] However, video loops in this style began growing in popularity on Vine in the middle of 2014, after an update to the application's video tools allowed users to upload videos made with external cameras. Since users could import any video from their phone's memory, it became simple to create loops in animation programs and upload them to Vine. The first instance to receive attention outside of Vine, a game using an image of Drake (below right), was posted by the popular user @DonJulio[3] on December 27th, 2014, and received over 15 million loops in the first six months since its posting. In Captain Phillips a band of Somali pirates led by Abduwali Muse board a container ship, the MV Maersk Alabama, which is the first United States cargo ship to fall prey to piracy in over two hundred years. The titular character, Captain Phillips, has his authority revoked by Muse when the pirate tells him "Hey! Look at me. Look at me. I'm the captain now." The film was critically acclaimed, receiving six Academy Award nominations, and a box office success, grossing over $218 million internationally.[5] During a One Direction concert held on July 9th, 2015, band member Styles concert in San Diego stumbled backwards and fell down while carrying a microphone stand (shown below). That evening Viner Stalker Sarah posted a video clip of the fall, which gained over 6.9 million loops, 19,000 likes and 10,000 revines in the first four days (shown below). On November 11th, 2014, Tumblr user chrisprattsgf[2] submitted a parody date transcript in which she suddenly grabs breadsticks off a dinner table and leaves after her date reveals he is a cat person (shown below). In the next year, the post gathered upwards of 67,600 notes.   On December 28th, 2000, the Sponge Squarepants episode "Imitation Krabs" was broadcast, in which the character Plankton disguises himself as Mr. Krabs to steal a formula for krabby patties, saying "ravioli ravioli, give me the formuoli" (shown below).[1] Cats with these hairstyles being compared to Donald Trump dates back to at least 2011, when an image was created in the style of a Demotivational Poster where a cat with a ring of discarded fur on its head says "Your Fired"(sic) in the style of Trump.[1] The comparison has been made with several other photographs of cats with fur clumps on their heads in the four years between the original post and July 14th, 2015, including on websites like Free Republic.[2]  According to the Online Etymology Dictionary,[1] the word "brigade" was originally a French word for "body of soldiers." According to Wiktionary,[3] the English variation of the word refers to "a group of people organized for a common purpose." Following the rise in popularity of Reddit, various factions on the website began encouraging each other to vote on content as a group. According to Reddit's "Rules of Reddit" page,[5] practices that can be considered a type of "vote manipulation" are prohibited on the site, including "sharing links with your friends or coworkers and asking them to vote" (shown below). The earliest known use of the term "brigade" in the context of website voting was in a post by blogger Konstantine Thoukydides about the Toy Town Germany web forum, which referred to a massively downvoted thread as the result of a "downvote brigade."[8] In May 2015, high school student Isaac Weiss submitted his friend Emilee McCubbins' cat as a Democratic Party candidate in the 2016 presidential election with the U.S. Federal Election Commission (shown below). On August 31st, 2010, Metroid: Other M, the twelfth release in Nintendo's action-adventure video game franchise Metroid, was released in North America and in Japan and Australia on September 3rd. In the game, which takes place on the Galactic Federation Bottle Ship in a setting between Super Metroid and Metroid Fusion, the protagonist Samus Aran investigates a derelict space station along with a Galactic Federation platoon, which includes her former commanding officer, Adam Malkovich. Upon its release, Metroid: Other M received generally positive reviews on its gameplay from critics and mixed reactions from the fans, many players expressed disappointment at the lacking quality of character development and dialogue screenplay in the game, especially the revamped personality of the protagonist Samus, whose character was widely perceived as overly submissive and weak, a drastic departure from her "lone wolf bounty hunter" character developed in the previous titles. In the midst of the backlash, "the baby" as uttered by Samus numerous times in the opening sequence, soon came to encapsulate the fans' sentiment. While many details surrounding the genesis of the fandom rivalry remain unclear, the debate most likely began to gain traction at the turn of the century, sometime after the premiere of Dragon Ball Z in the United States on Cartoon Network's Toonami programming block in 1998. In the October 2002 issue of Wizard Magazine the magazine included a fight between Goku and Superman as part of their "East vs West" segment which pitted western heroes against Japanese ones (shown below). In the fight Goku emerged as the victor. The earliest known notable example of an online discussion relating to the topic can be found on Newgrounds in a forum thread titled "Goku VS. Superman," submitted by Alakazam on January 23rd, 2003.[1]  After 2013, the driest recorded year in California's history, the state began introducing marketing to educate people to stop consuming as much water. The marketing encouraged California's residents to stop watering lawns, filling pools, and other wasteful activities, and instituted a $500 fine for those who were caught doing so.[1] Some cities instituted a hotline so that neighbors could begin calling in to report their neighbors' water usage and the practice proved effective; after this hotline was created in Sacramento, CA, water use declined by 17%.[2] It's unclear where the first use of the hashtag #droughtshaming comes from, but consistent use of the term on social media began in mid-June, 2014; the practice began even earlier. On July 4th, 2014, the New York Times recorded instances of drought shaming that dated back to April of that year.[3] On June 22nd, 2015, VanossGaming uploaded a video titled "GTA 5 Online Funny Moments," in which a Grand Theft Auto V character performing stand-up comedy while wearing an owl mask delivers a joke about a magic owl named"Hoodini" (shown below). Within three weeks, the video gained over 6.8 million views and 9,000 comments. The earliest known use of the #SunburnArt hashtag was in a tweet posted by @MeowSyz[1] on January 27th, 2014, which featured a photograph of a woman's back with a floral sunburn design (shown below).   In February 2015, YouTube began displaying a pre-roll ad featuring Tai Lopez showing off his Lamborghini and bookshelf while promoting his self improvement video program "67 Steps to Wealth, Health, Love, and Happiness" (shown below). Klinik Tong Fang began operating in the Indonesian capital city of Jakarta around 2010. Between 2011 to 2012, the clinic began promoting their services via commercial on a number of television stations. The commercial has been heavily criticized for its use of allege patient testimonies which has been considered deceptive about curing illnesses and breaking ethical laws in Indonesian Television broadcasting. On August 14th, 2012, the clinic received penalty from the North Jakarta Public Health Office for violating the Indonesian constitution regarding publication of health services and advertising traditional medicine.[5] The pony was first created on January 3rd, 2012[1] by Mixermike622 as a representation of himself although he is sometimes negative about the outcome of what he had created. The challenge reportedly began as a hashtag campaign to combat the widespread phenomenon of body shaming on the Internet, with some of its earliest instances submitted to Instagram sometime between late June and early July 2015. The identity of the hashtag creator or the location of the original instance remains unclear; however, Chicago Tribune has cited British beauty blogger Em Ford's makeup tutorial video titled "YOU LOOK DISGUSTING" as a potential source of trigger that may have given rise to the hashtag. On July 9th, 2009, the Shemrock Nursery Rhymes YouTube channel uploaded an animated video of a young boy who is scolded for eating sugar, featuring the rhyme sung to the tune of the children's song "Twinkle Twinkle, Little Star" playing in the background. In the first six years, the video garnered over 2.9 million views. On January 31st, 2011, Awkward Zombie released a webcomic titled "Great Wololo Of China (Part1)"[1] which pokes fun at the villager's poor artificial intelligence (AI) in Age of Empires II_. On February 7th that same year, the second part of "Great Wololo Of China"[2] was released. On February 10th, 2011, the earliest known image macro poking fun at Age of Empire's flawed logics was submitted to Meme Generator.[3] Based on an advice animal-style cutout image of one of the kings featured on the cover box of Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings. The series has since accumulated more than 10,600 derivatives over the span of four years.  The origin of Dragon Ball AF was contested for many years, until on February 14th, 2012, when a thread was created on Kanzenshuu in which the original poster, Raykugen, posted images from the May 1999 issue of Spanish video game "Hobby Consolas" that revealed the origin of the Dragon Ball AF name as well as the original Dragon Ball AF image (shown below). It was also revealed that the name of the artist was Daniel Montiel Franco.[1] In a series of e-mail correspondences with Dragon Ball fan and author Derek Padula for his 2012 book Dao of Dragon Ball, Franco stated that the character in the image was not a depiction of the Dragon Ball protagonist Son Goku, as many fans speculated, but rather an original character named Tablos.[2] The original still frame (shown below) featuring Rainbow Dash saluting was taken from the seventh episode of the first season of MLP, Dragonshy.[1] In the scene, Rainbow Dash performs the gesture in response to a patriotic remark by Twilight Sparkle.     Although the etymology of "baka" remains uncertain, some speculate that the word "baka" was first used in Chinese literature as early as in 246 B.C. However, the earliest known written usage of "baka" on record can be traced to an excerpt from the traditional historical epic Taiheiki which denotes bakamono (馬鹿者) being used as an insult in 1342 during the Nanboku-chō period (1336–1392) and the civil unrest between the Northern and Southern Courts. The definition of baka that is used today was thought to be used around 1663-1733, from the Sanskrit meaning “foolish.”[1] "Yoritō, probably inebriated, loudly demands to know what kind of fool (bakamono) has the temerity to order him to dismount."  Prior to the coinage of the term "battlestation," photographs of impressive desktop setups were often shared on various websites online. On April 17th, 2008, the tech news blog Nerd Business[5] published a compilation of notable photographs of impressive home office setups. On November 25th, 2009, the /r/battlestations[1] subreddit was launched, which features user-submitted photographs of high-end desktop computer spaces. Within six years, the community gained over 167,500 subscribers. Although the origin of the phrase is unknown and some of its early instances dates back to 2012, the phrase shot in to widespread usage on the site after a crowdsourced campaign to identify the suspects behind the 2013 Boston Marathon Bombings, mistakenly placed the spotlight on Sunil Tripathi, an American college student who had been missing for months. Soon, Redditors began congratulating themselves by using the phrase, though it quickly turned into an ironic reminder of negative effects when vigilant efforts are made without official guidance, as it became clear the student in question had nothing to do with the attack.[1][2][3][4] Bad Girls Club, an American reality TV show that follows the lives of seven aggressive and quarrelsome women living in a luxurious mansion for three months, premiered on Oxygen on December 5th, 2006.[1] In the Season 2, Episode 30 titled "Prank Wars Part 3: Phat Lady," aired on January 29th, 2008, one of the newly casted members of the show Tanisha Thomas starts a loud ruckus in the house after getting fed up with housemates, Jennavicia, Cordelia and Darlen, who had invited male guests and kept her awake the previous night (shown below). When the housemates refuse to clean up their mess after the party, Tanisha grabs a set of baking pans and proceeds to stomp around the house. Banging the pans together, she yells to "GET THE HELL UP!" and "CLEAN THE FUCKING HOUSE!" with the occasional "I'M TIRED OF THIS SHIT!" After previously waking up a crashing member on the living room couch with "LET ME HEAR YOU SAY BWOMP BWOMP!", she makes her way down the brightly-patterned hall to the open bedroom doors, leading to the iconic shot of her screaming a strangely rhythmic, sing-songy "I DIDN'T GET NO FUCKING SLEEP 'CAUSE OF Y'ALL! YA'LL NOT GONNA GET NO SLEEP 'CAUSE OF ME!" whilst banging the pans. The first Tiny Hamster video, titled "Tiny Hamster Eating Tiny Burritos (Ep. 1)" was uploaded by the YouTube account HelloDenizen,[1] run by the social media marketing agency Denizen,[2] on April 29th, 2014. As of July 2nd, 2015, the video has received over 10.6 million views. The Minions were first introduced as the supervillain antagonist Gru's personal army of clumsy but lovable assistants in the original film Despicable Me[1] (shown below, left). Upon the premiere of Despicable Me in 2010, the film was mostly met with positive reviews from the critics and moviegoers, many of whom also highlighted the adorability of the curious and mischievous Minions for their cute appearance and quirky demeanors. In 2013, the yellow pill-shaped characters made their reprisal in the sequel film Despicable Me 2 (shown below, right), in which the Minions play a larger role in the storyline as some of them are turned into purple-furred mutant savages by another villain Eduardo Pérez. As the popularity of the minor characters continued to grow, three short films loosely connected to the storyline of Despicable Me were released with the DVD edition that same year, Home Makeover, Orientation Day and Banana, in all of which the Minions are prominently featured as main characters. In July 2012, a simulator ride attraction named Despicable Me: Minion Mayhem opened up at Universal Studios Florida, which features a short film starring the characters. In 2013, an additional set of three short films starring the Minions, Puppy, Panic in the Mailroom, and Training Wheels were released as part of the DVD edition of Despicable Me. "Jo baka" is a colloquialism associated with Gujarat. It is unknown where the emoticon commonly associated with the phrase originates.   pirate voice for effect NOW LET ME TELL YA A STORY YOU MIGHT THINK IT BE VERY GOREY BUT WAIT TILL I COME OUT OF IT WITH A STORY YOU BE IN FOR A DORY ahem Now kids, we gather around for the birth of a beautiful meme, a story so few of us know about (or care about lol). And this story goes about the story of the story, of a story of a man (who is also the title of this story) named Findlang. Findlang was once a troubled young lad, who lived on the shore of a beach town in the old times named "Le Noob Island". It was for only the most professional mlg-pirates and haxlEEtnoscoping-swashbucklers. Findlang used to live in a city called "Google", a sprawling metropolis but with terrible corruption of its political officials. Due to internal conflict, the city was destroyed by "MLG PIRATES FOR HIRE LOL XD". Choosing life or death, Findlang decided to take life into his own hands and join the pirates, for his own survival. Life was very weird for him at first, readjusting his social views to fit into this seemingly "dank" alien world. So, he became a squab (or "skrub" as the pirates called him) for one of the most legendary pirates out there, SNIPARS! (pause for dramatic effect). Ever since then, he's been living a life, drinking crisp, tasty Mountain Dew, and crunching down on the finest and most golden Doritos money/gold/wenches could buy. But they say that one day he will overtake snipars in his dankness, and become the next savior of dank memes. The /mlp/ pony artist Ass Stalker has claimed to be the creator of Aryanne. In a March 2014 interview[3] with Horse News, he described the origin of the character: When did you/the threads start picking up? I used to draw on Flockmod before. I was still a noob. I drew Rainbow Dash and Applejack often that time. Because of my poor style, people and I cannot recognize what pony I drew. So it combine both of them and then my friend made a joke and added a "nazi" symbol on it The first image of Aryanne[4] to be uploaded to MLP image hosting site Derpibooru was submitted on February 14th, 2014, created by the artist randy. In the 20th episode of the 5th season of the American animated sitcom The Simpsons the character Bart has a dream sequence where he imagines himself as Huckleberry Finn. Two new characters show up on a raft and say: [10] [11] On January 27, 2006 webcomic series Rob and Elliot uploaded a strip entitled "Dead Body" in which a man asks the two protagonists if they "wanna see a dead body?" (shown below).[3] Shabani was born at Apenheul Primate Park in the Netherlands in October 1996. Two months later, in December that year, the newborn ape moved with his family to Taronga Zoo in Sydney, Australia, where he spent most of his formative years, before relocating again to Higashiyama Zoo and Botanical Gardens in Nagoya, Japan in 2007. In the following years, Shabani established himself as the protector of his pack and started his own family with two wives and fathered two children, according to the zoo officials. However, the western lowland gorilla, who is in his late 30s or early 40s in human years, didn't rise to the status of a national sensation in Japan until March 2015, when a photograph of Shabani and one of his mates, Ai, taken by a visitor from a panel at the zoo went viral on the Internet. While the image was originally intended to highlight a fist-pumping gesture made by Ai, the focal point of online conversations quickly shifted to the male gorilla, as many Japanese Internet users on Twitter began obsessing over his strikingly photogenic appearance. In January 19, 2014, Markiplier posted a video of the first part of his playthrough A Late Night Drink, a custom story from Amnesia: The Dark Descent. While Markiplier is looking for a key (4:16), he found a tiny wooden crate near him and finds it adorable. Markiplier names it Tiny Box Tim, and so the fandom of Tiny Box Tim is born. While this is the official origin of Tim, Mark and fans have forged their own story for him. In the indie horror game The Plague, Mark claims that the Timothy in that game is who Tim was before his death. After his murder, Timothy possessed the box. It is due to this violent act that Tim is primarily a protector. There is even a fan game that explains Tim's origins. The infamous original vine features Krath, standing in a Ronald McDonald costume screaming "LET'S MCFREAKING LOSE IT! GET OUT OF YO MIND!" at McDonald's patrons in Keller, TX. (All of the locations are in the central Texas area) Day 1 of the Vine series, shown here, has him in a much smaller McDonald's, pouring what appears to be an ICEE or soda over himself, and thrusting his pelvis.   On October 2nd, 2011, Urban Dictionary[4] user JOHNxRYAN95 created an entry for "What Are Those?", defining it as a question yelled at someone wearing unkempt or off-brand footwear.

Unknown Disney's 33rd animated feature film Pocahontas was released June 23rd, 1995. In one of the climactic scenes, Pocahontas, the main character and the princess of the Powhatan tribe, kisses John Smith, the 16th-century English explorer captured by her people, in a forest. Upon seeing the two kiss, Kocoum, the tribe's second-in-command warrior that Pocahontas was supposed to be marrying, hurls himself into John Smith while letting out a battle scream in a jealous rage.[1] Reddit user ajaxknight remade the scene in a high quality GIF on February 1st, 2014.[2] The original image came from the profile picture of the now defunct Dion Cecep Supriadi Blogspot[1] which dates back to May, 2005.  The phrase is presumably often said without irony by rebellious teenagers who are antagonized by authority figures, like parents or teachers, regarding a particular (long-term) choice. Multiple submissions in urban dictionary aptly define the word phase.[1] The earliest known instance of the phrase trending online is on 2010, the same year that Scene Wolf – an advice animal that often makes use of the phrase – began spreading.  On July 10th, 1987, Shy Guys were first introduced with the release of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) game Super Mario Bros. 2, in which they serve as minions of the primary antagonist Wart. The character, and much of the entire game, had been remade from the Japanese Famicom game Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic.[2] The character later appeared in subsequent games in the Super Mario franchise, including the Mario vs. Donkey Kong, Yoshi, Mario Kart, Super Smash Bros. and Mario Party series. The earliest known usage of "MILF" can be found in a thread on the Usenet group alt.mag.playboy[4] submitted by user ChiPhiMike on January 12th, 1995. In the thread, he describes several models shown in a pictorial spread from an issue of Playboy Magazine as "MILFs."

According to JJBA community forums[1], the Duwang scanlation (scan-and-translation) of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond Is Unbreakable was done by a Chinese JJBA fan as a school project for his English class over a period of about a month. The name, Duwang, comes from the mistranslation of Morioh, the name of the fictional town where the story takes place, in Japanese kanji characters.  Tweeting out-of-context snippets for novelty Twitter profiles was originated by Horse_ebooks in 2009. One of the first Twitter accounts to quote a user-made source while using the "txt" name was @wwwtxt, which uses the source material of Usenet conversations between 1980 and 1994. The Twitter account, which has been running since October 2010, has made over 3,700 tweets and is followed by over 23,800 people.[1] Has anyone else here seen the World Wide Web? It's one of the best new things on Internet. ☯94MAY — wwwtxt (1980-94) (@wwwtxt) July 7, 2014 The original image, consisting of Twilight Sparkle standing behind a glass of spilled milk with her left hoof outstretched, was created by Furseiseki.[1] It was posted in February 2012 to FurAffinity in a post titled "I speel ur malk" (shown below). The two-paneled original version of the meme, also created by Furseiseki, was posted[2] to MLP image hosting site Derpibooru in August 2012. The Solo Jazz pattern was created in the art department of the Sweetheart Cup Company in the early 1991 and began production across a variety of waxed paper products in 1992.[1] In 2012, users of the photo-sharing website dump.fm began re-appropriating the pattern and photoshopping it into different environments – some users estimate that over 100,000 different images using the pattern were created.[4][5] These images spread across Tumblr and Reddit, often used in reference to nostalgia for the 1990s. A dedicated Facebook page was created on February 6th, 2012; as of June 2015, the page had more than 4,000 fans.[2] A Tumblr was created the same day, and posted continuously until October 2014.[3] The earliest known mention of the cups on Reddit was an image post in the subreddit /r/nostalgia on November 14th, 2013, which received 86 points (93% upvoted).[6] In April of 2015, clothing company 1991Inc created a line of clothing featuring the pattern, which quickly sold out after being featured in notable blogs like those of the Laughing Squid[7] and Pee Wee Herman.[8] On June 22nd, CNN Tonight broadcast a special segment titled Does This Offend You?, which begins with the host Don Lemon holding up a Confederate flag, followed by a sign featuring the racial slur in its uncensored form, before rhetorically asking the audiences if they found it offensive. On November 29th, 2011, Tumblr user theshewxlf[7] submitted a post titled "Sex facts according to your sign," listing various sexual interests and attitudes for each zodiac sign (shown below).

Over the next year, the video received over 13 million views and 3,900 comments. Leggy Lamb originally appeared in the 1958 cartoon Sheep Wrecked. In the cartoon, a wolf character tries to steal a sheep from a yard; one such attempt at stealing the sheep involved a plunger launched with a bow. Instead of bringing back the sheep, it instead rips some wool off of the sheep; the next shot shows the sheep, who is suddenly anthropomorphized. The name "Leggy Lamb" is derived from the next line said by the wolf: The first instance of Leggy on /co/ was in December 17th, 2012, accompanied by the text "uncomfortably sexy gif thread."[1] On February 9, 2013, the segment of Sheep Wrecked featuring Leggy was uploaded to YouTube by the account StealthPornucopia, where it gradually accumulated 2,225 views by June of 2015.[2]  On June 12th, 2007, Gamedev.ru Forums[1] user zudl submitted the Ball of Swiborg in a thread asking for feedback about the 3D model. After receiving criticism about the sphere's facial expression, zudl referred to the character's face as "brutal and heartless." On August 18th, 2009, Urban Dictionary[12] user supersrs submitted an entry for "RBF," defining it as an initialism for the "resting bitch face" involuntary facial expression. The audio for the clip consists of a combination of two parts. The soundtrack comes from John Cena's actual WWE introduction, first used in 2005, while the visuals in most versions come from the 2012 edition of his introduction video. YouTuber TripleFlipKick360 uploaded the introduction video on May 6th, 2012, gaining over 18 million views as of July 20th, 2015 (shown below, left).

On June 14th, 2013, Solo and several other DotA players, including others from Solo's team, RoX.KIS, played the team zRAGE in SLTV StarSeries Season 6 (clip below). That match featured Solo and members of his team performing a series of questionable maneuvers that contributed to their loss. Following the match, Solo and his teammates were accused of "throwing" the match, which Solo had bet $100 on. According to the DotA gamepedia,[1] "Alexei "Solo" Berezin placed a bet against his own team on a real-currency gambling site, and the StarLadder organization ruled that his teammates in the game were complicit. The RoX.KIS organization was banned from participating in StarLadder for one year." The earliest use of the term can be found on 4chan's anime and manga discussion board /a/, in form of haiku related to Holo, the main character of the light novel and anime series Spice and Wolf who is a wolf under human appearance, submitted on February 3rd, 2008.[2] Although, is believed that the term started being used on Spice and Wolf's anime premiere, during January, 2008. James Murray posted the first three pictures on Jim'll Paint it on February 21, 2013. The images assumed what would become the standard format for the posts: a letter written to Jim from a reader detailing a situation, along with Jim's presentation of the situation as depicted in MS Paint.[1] For example, this letter: was accompanied by this image: On June 10th, 2015, Jurassic World premiered in Los Angeles, California, starring actor Chris Pratt as the protagonist Owen Grady, a dinosaur researcher and expert on the genus Velociraptor. During one scene in the film, Grady is shown holding off a trio of Velociraptors in a pit by laterally extending his arms (shown below). On June 17th, 2015, Tumblr user feminerds posted a screen capture of the scene directly above a photograph of a zookeeper reenacting the pose with three walruses (shown below). In the first 24 hours, the post gained over 111,000 notes. In Monster Girl Quest when faced against a kitsune named Tamamo , the protagonist is given the option to perform is “Touch Fluffy Tail”. Selecting this option will cause the player to be overcome by the “fluffiness” and lose the game.

While it remains unknown where or when the original image (shown below) was first posted, the earliest archived example can be found 4chan’s /tv/ board in April 13th, 2013[1]. The image featured this accompanying text: Roy debuted in the second installment of the Super Smash Bros. series, Super Smash Bros. Melee.[1] In every Smash Bros. game, an audience will occasionally cheer for a player. In Melee, if a player is using Roy, the crowd will cheer "Roy's our boy".[2] According to a Finnish Wiki site Meemi.info[1], "Le American Bear" first originated on a Finnish imageboard's Ylilauta /int/ board. Eventually, on January 5th, 2012, the earliest known archived image surfaced on 4chan's /jp/ (otaku culture) board[2], depicting the American Bear as a tourist. The Tumblr blog Kim Jong Un Looking At Things[1] was launched by an anonymous Tumblr blogger on December 18th, 2011, the same day North Korea’s state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) announced that its leader Kim Jong-Il had died from a massive heart attack, with a photograph of the stern looking Successor in a post titled "looking at YOU," which gained more than 800 notes. The quote was first uttered in the movie Saw which was released in 2004. The quote is uttered by Jigsaw to his victims as he begins his death game where the individual must solve puzzles and disarm traps before being killed as time runs out. The quote has subsequently appeared in other movies in the series. The Tumblr blog "Kim Jong Il Looking At Things"[1] was launched by Portuguese art director creator João Rocha on October 6th, 2010. All of the original photographs were taken and published by the state-run Korean Central News Agency, North Korea's propaganda wing mainly used to promote Kim Jong Il's public image and the state's official Juche[2] ideology.

During Twitch[1] user Nerdcubed's E3 livestream on June 16th, 2015, Hardcastle joked that someone should yell the phrase "Have a wank" during the conference to mock the bland interview segments. Additionally, he urged viewers to help make the hashtag #HaveAWank[4] a trending topic on Twitter (shown below). On August 28th, 2011, DeviantArt artist Dreatos posted an image[1] titled "Beginning your music career" consisting of the MLP character Vinyl Scratch holding a vinyl record with her mouth. In the description of the image, the artist linked an image consisting of a series of still frames depicting Vinyl Scratch spinning around on a record player (shown below). On October 25th, 2011, fellow DeviantArt user EROCKERTORRES used the frames that Dreatos had made in order to create a vectored GIF of Vinyl Scratch spinning,[2] in a post titled "Vinyl Spnning [sic] on Vinyl" (shown below). The earliest known use of the phrase appeared on the Elite Fitness[1] message board on May 13th, 2002, when forum member SSAlexSS asked other board members about the purpose of powerlifting exercises. In response, member t3c responded that SSAlexSS was ignorant about proper training methods, and referred to him as an "Internet tough guy" (shown below). The original ilustration comes from the video game Atelier Ayesha: The Alchemist of Dusk, released in June 2012 in Japan and March 2013 in America and Europe, featuring the character Tanya Volta[1] on a corset, drawn by the game illustrator Hidari "Left Side".[3] On August 13th, 2013, user Benit149 uploaded the picture to Danbooru, getting a score of 14 and 26 favorites.[2] The earliest captioned instance can be found on a thread submited on 4chan's cooking board /ck/ asking for bread recipes, submited on June 6th, 2013.[4] The term "20XX" originates from games in the Mega Man franchise which are set in the ambiguous year "20XX." In Super Smash Bros. Melee, the character Fox is considered by many to be the most powerful character due to his unique moveset, which includes the versatile special ability "shine." In October 2013, commentator Kris "Toph" Alexander described the concept of "20XX" during the Big House 3 tournament: On December 31st, 1999, a primitive version of Squarepants depicted with long canines and wearing a loincloth was introduced in the episode "SB-129,"[6] in which the character Squidward Tentacles travels back in time to the pre-historic era (shown below).  The video was originally uploaded in the 12th of August in 2009, uploaded by the band's drummer, Todd Siefke, however, the first post mentioning the video on /mu/ dates to February of 2013[1]. In 1995, Nancy Lieder, a Wisconsin resident who claims that she was contacted by a group of grey aliens known as "Zetas" and had her brain implanted with a communications device during her childhood, laid out the foundation of the planetary collision theory on her newly launched website ZetaTalk.com. According to Lieder's original account, the aliens had warned her of an impending global catastrophe that would supposedly take place on May 23rd, 2003, during which the surface of our planet would be devastated by a violent disruption of its magnetic core as a result of its extremely close encounter with another planet four times the size of the Earth. In the original Friendship is Witchcraft abridged parody series, the first episode of which was released in June 2011, she is voiced by Griffin Lewis using a voice modifier.[1] Despite her obviously robotic voice, none of the characters in the series are aware that she is a robot, herself included. As a result, some running jokes include the fact that she thinks out loud in subroutines and computer commands, and that water makes her "feel funny".[2] The exact origin of the phrase is unknown, however the idea that the Internet is a single machine that can be "broken" or "broken into" was a common misconception in the media of the 1990s. Hackers were frequently described as having "broken into" the Internet. A 1993 story about a person stealing DNS access described the person as having "broken into the Internet, as in "Police have made what they believe is one of Canada's first arrests for breaking into the Internet, the worldwide computer network."[2]   On June 8th, 2015, Dice uploaded a new installment in his "crazy petitions"[8] video series titled "Obama Supporters Sign Petition to Nuke Russia so American will Stay World's Super Power" to YouTube, in which he asks random beach-goers in San Diego, California to sign a petition supporting President Obama in launching a preemptive nuclear strike against Russia to maintain "American superiority" (shown below).

Blair subsequently posted the images to the r/funny sub-Reddit.[2] As of June 10th, 2015, the Imgur album has over 5 million views and the Reddit post gathered more than 38.000 upvotes (96% upvoted). While the original comic is rumored to have launched on 4chan, the exact origin is unknown. On March 16th, 2012, an edited 60's Spider-Man comic with a book titled "Famous Faggots of 4chan," featuring an "OP is a Faggot" joke, was submitted to the /r/4chan subreddit (shown below, left).[3] Prior to being archived, the post gained over 3,900 votes (96% upvoted) and 40 comments. On imageboard communities such as 4chan, the greater-than sign, when used after a line break, allows the user to change the rest of the line's font color to green. While the feature was originally intended to enable posters to differentiate quoted text from their own,[1] it soon found alternate uses and meanings with the emergence of "greentext" culture, often in conjunction with other well-known terms and phrases like implying, mfw, and [year], as well as green text stories, which are one of 4chan's most popular forms of exported content.   On February 8th, 2012, North Carolina resident Tommy Jordan posted a video on his Facebook page in which he scolds his 15-year-old daughter Hanna for posting a curse-ridden status update about her parents on the social media platform. In the video, Jordan reveals that he was able to bypass her security settings which had blocked him from viewing the update. After reciting her Facebook post, Jordan concludes his rebuttal by shooting Hanna’s laptop with a .45 pistol (seen at 7:10 in the video below). In the first five days, the Facebook post received over 74,000 likes and 30,000 shares. Within four years, the YouTube video gained over 40 million views and 269,000 comments.  The meme clearly came from the popular 2011 Marvel movie Thor, starring Chris Hemsworth as the titular character. Various screen caps from the first and second movies are used as well as posters that include Thor. On June 4th, 2015, Twitter user @bethdedwards_[3] posted a tweet in anticipation of taking the GCSE Math exam[1] later that morning, including an image macro of an elderly man talking to a doctor in a hospital bed accompanied by the hashtag #EdexcelMaths (shown below).

On September 12th, 2014, Redditor johnnylogic submitted a picture of a woman's profile with the haircut, along with the caption "The 'can I speak to the manager' haircut" to /r/funny[1] (shown below). Prior to being archived, the post gained over 3,100 points (72% upvoted) and 370 comments. While it's unclear where exactly "Karen" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas (clip below). Some believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine "The Friend That Nobody Likes," which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says: The scene in question originates from the 17th episode of the first season titled Rock Bottom which aired on March 20, 2000.[1] The scene occurs right after Spongebob is left alone in a closed bus station at the middle of the night in a faraway town much deeper in the ocean than Bikini Bottom.

The commercial, which was met with mixed-to-negative reception, was viewed over 850,000 times in less than a month, with over 6,000 likes and 8,000 dislikes.[1] On November 16th, 2004, Valve released Half-Life 2, in which the player acquires a "zero-point energy field manipulator" device early in the game. Originally designed to transport hazardous material, the gravity gun is mainly use to remove heavy objects from obstructing your path. Additionally, objects like razor blades and exploding barrels can be shot back at enemies using the device    The earliest known rendition of the phrase was uploaded to Joyreactor[1] on April 24th, 2011, by an anonymous user, tagging it with 9gag (shown below). The weapon made its first appearance in the 1993 first person shooter game Doom, which was designed by Tom Hall. In the game, the BFG or BFG9000 is described as a high-energy weapon that fires balls of green plasma. The weapon has the capability to clear entire rooms of enemies and a direct hit would usually be an instant kill. The BFG is considered to be strongest weapon in the entire game.

"Ahorita no, joven," is a common expression in Spanish, often used by elders to dismiss younger people. It has has been applied to other image macros before being linked explicitly to images of dogs. The origin of the meme is considered to be a Japanese video posted on YouTube on April 24th, 2014 by the user "yu k". In the video, a man goes to a cigar shop and is initially attended to by a shiba inu dog called Shiba-Chan, who opens the shop window as soon as the man arrives. On August 11th, 2014 YouTube user kanadajin3 posted a video about the same dog in English. After the initial video upload, images of Shiba-Chan at the store window with the caption “Ahorita no, joven” were posted on Spanish-speaking sites, where they spread. It is still unknown the exact date of the first meme, but according to Google Trends, the first searches of the phrase started in October, 2014. Internet users applied the phrase to other well-known dog memes, including Yes, This is Dog, Cool Dog, Lawyer Dog and Doge. A Spanish-language meme generator contains one image using the phrase *Ahorita no, Joven" but with TV presenter Laura Bozzo, posted on October 16th, 2014. Another example comes from a pets blog, showing the meme in aa small article posted on October 9th, 2014. An older video posted on YouTube on March 16th, 2011, already used the expression "Ahorita no, joven" and showed a dog dancing, but up to 2015 it only received less than 700 views and only 2 positive votes. The copypasta originated on December 30th, 2013, in 4chan's /v/ (video game) board on a thread titled, "Who is the Madara Uchiha of video games?" (seen below).[6] On December 31st, 2013, the copypasta was then submitted by an anonymous 4chan user to /v/ as its own thread (shown below).[1] The question was pointed out for its redundancy and long specifications. The anime originally began airing on October 3rd, 2002, and was produced by Studio Pierrot. After certain episodes, the anime faces issues involving the plot reaching where the manga is currently at. To get around this without the need to put the anime on hiatus, the series will often employ fillers in the form of creating side arcs which have no real impact to the main story or by adding flashback scenes into the main story to slow down the pacing. The practice has since been heavily criticized by the anime community as it often detracts the main story too much which in turn degrades the overall quality of the show. The side arcs have also been criticized for its lackluster plot and animation. Early reviews of the Mad Max film received praise from feminists and others for plot points and female characters that were well-written and well-rounded. This, in turn, raised the ire of Men's Rights Activists, who called the film feminist propaganda.[6] Feminist Mad Max is possibly a response to this allegation. Feminist Mad Max created its first post on Tumblr[1] on May 18th, 2015. As of May 27th, the post had over 13,000 notes. The comics started being made on /v/ and /tg/. One of the most popular ones features two Space Pirates discussing about the use of tubes in order to make their base, claiming that they were useless for them and helped Samus Aran, but their conversation ends and they keep putting more tubes. Because of that comic, a running gag on the series is the obession that Space Pirates have for tubes. At the end of a basketball game between the Atlanta Hawks and the Cleveland Cavaliers, in which the Cavaliers won 114-111 in an overtime victory, LeBron James collapsed on the floor while walking toward the bench (shown below). The term Humblebrag first appeared as part of a novelty twitter account[1] created by late comedian Harris Wittels[2] in November 2010. The account was dedicated to retweeting other tweets which Wittels saw as Humblebrags, beginning with a tweet by actor and comedian Matt Braunger, referring to a day of shooting with the more popular actor Bryan Cranston (shown below). About creating the term, Wittels told the Wall Street Journal: On September 25th, 2012, Wittels published a book called Humblebrag: The Art of False Modesty. Although the exact origin of the abbreviation is unknown, it may have arisen as a form of text speak with the rise of SMS messaging in the 1990s. On June 23rd, 2003, Urban Dictionary[6] user Suzuki submitted an entry for TBH, defining it as an initialism for "to be honest." On June 6th, 2014, the challenge may have originated with a video titled "Jugando Charly Charlie" (playing Charly Charlie) uploaded by YouTuber Le Videoblog, in which two men form a rectangle out of six pencils before calling upon a spirit to move the pencils into a hexagon shape (shown below). On January 6th, 2015, the pencil blog Pencils.com[9] published an article explaining the rules of the game, which included the "Charlie Charlie" chant. In cartooning, noses are occasionally filled in with a different color than the rest of the face for contrast, especially when the nose is exaggerated in size.[1] Classic examples of this can be seen in Disney characters such as the dwarfs from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Pinocchio from the movie of the same name. However, the Tumblr Nose is usually proportional and visibly attached to the rest of the face, as opposed to a separate facial element. The exact online origin of the Tumblr nose is unknown. The first instance of the catchphrase can be found on a thread submitted on 4chan's /tv/ board on July 15th, 2014, featuring a close-up photo of Seth Rogen's face along with the message "DUDE WEED LMAO", mocking his tendency to feature stoner humor in his films.[1] The same thread also featured posts that mock Rogen's comedy tropes. On May 23rd, 2015, Twitter user MascotMY_Tweets (Kendall Gaines)[1] began tweeting a series of found Vine and Instagram videos which he tagged with the hashtag #BeyonceAlwaysOnBeat. The first clip tweeted with the hashtag was originally by Vine user Nelly the King, originally posted on February 20th, 2015. It shows a clip from the Beyoncé video "Flawless" edited to create the illusion that Beyoncé is dancing to the Little Einsteins Theme. As of May 26th, 2015, the Vine had accrued over 2,500,000 loops; MascotMY_Tweets original tagged tweet of the video received 4,511 retweets and 3,118 favorites. #BeyoncéAlwaysOnBeat Part 1 https://t.co/OIGyu3P2Ya MascotMy_Tweets eventually tweeted out over thirty tweets in his #BeyoncéAlwaysOnBeat series. By the following day, users were creating new videos for him to tweet out, and also creating other similar hashtags featuring Nicki Minaj, Rihanna, and Whitney Houston. The earliest use of the phrase can be found in a thread submitted to 4chan's /tv/ (television and film) board on July 23th, 2010, which included a message criticizing the ending of Inception.[3] The image comes from a scene in episode 20 titled Cold Hands, which was released on August 15, 2006[1]. Rika sprays Shion with pepper spray in order to inject her with a immunization for the Hinamizawa Syndrome. Shion retaliates and after a brief scuffle, threatens to torture Rika. Not wanting this fate, Rika stabs herself in the head with a butcher knife multiple times. The laugh starts at when, driven by insanity, Shion laughs maniacally at this.  In the series, the expression is used by several characters particularly during the namek saga with Krillin and Gohan suppressing their power level to avoid detection from Frieza's army as they attempt to find the dragon balls while Vegeta hides his power to suprise his enemies in battle as he also attempts to collect the balls for himself. According to archive.moe, one of the earliest recorded uses of the expression was in 4chan's /a/ board on February 11th, 2008 in which a user discusses how they were hiding their interest in several japanese songs during a karaoke session with friends[1]. The scene originated in 1999 in the film The Matrix, directed by Lana Wachowski and Andy Wachowski. During their mission to save Morpheus (Lawrence Fishbourne), Neo (Keanu Reeves) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) kill some soldiers on a rooftop. One of the soldiers turns into an Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) and begins chasing Trinity and Neo. The Smith shoots at Neo after Neo runs out of bullets. The iconic scene begins when Neo dodges the bullets by bending completely backwards before getting shot in the side and leg. In the 272nd chapter[1] of the Dragon Ball manga series, originally published in 1990 in Weekly Shonen Jump, and the Namek Saga of the anime series, a team of five elite mercenaries known as the Ginyu Force[2] is called upon by Frieza, the chapter's main villain character, to assist in conquering the planet of Namek by defeating the protagonist group of Saiyans and their friends. Upon their arrival on Namek, the members of the special force introduce themselves by performing an elaborately choreographed routine that bears resemblances to similar poses used by Super Sentai and Power Rangers teams (shown below).  The phrase has long been used in pagan and nature worship e-communities and could be commonly found on LiveJournal pages[1] as an alternative to the "comment" and "add comment" links. It suddenly became popular in early 2011, which is about the time gif making and posting increased in popularity[2] as well as when tumblr began to see a spike in users. "Bless This Post" has since firmly established itself on the social blogging platform.  On December 27th, 2007, Brendan Fraser announced that he and his wife Afton Smith were getting a divorce after nine years of marriage.[4] In early 2013, Fraser petitioned the courts for a reduction of his alimony, asserting he was unable to meet the annual obligation of $900,000.[1] On February 16th, 2015, a thread featuring an edited picture of Fraser with DiGiannantonio's hair and the post "I-is he gonna make it?" was submitted on 4chan's /tv/ board.[5] The image was originally made by the Tumblr user stargates on December 10th and 12th, 2014.[12][13] The edited image was taken from the 1967 Spider-Man animated series episode titled Electro The Human Lightning Bolt. In the scene, Spider-Man is taking cover under a desk as he battles against Electro (scene in question at 1:40). The first instance of the picture can be found on a template submitted to Meme Generator on October 18th, 2011, although the image macro did not use the caption "And I'm Just Sitting Here Masturbating" that the fad has come to be known as today[8]. On August 14th, 2012, Redditor yakkers09 submitted a post titled "This is how I feel when ever I scroll down my newsfeed,"[3] which featured an image of Spider-Man seated a a desk with the caption "Wow people have such interesting social lives / And I'm just sitting here masturbating" (shown below). Within one month, the post received over 12,800 up votes and 215 comments. On November 2nd, 2013, Tumblr[1] user halfprincesshalfgoddess posted an image macro featuring a photograph of actress Maisie Williams portraying the character Arya Stark in Game of Thrones with the caption "Did you just use your bible to warn me about hell? / May I quote from ASOIAF to warn you about Joffrey?" (shown below). While the origin of this phrase is unknown, it was first defined on Wiktionary on Feb 1, 2001, as being an English dialectical version of nice.[3] It was first defined on Urban Dictionary by user "Cracka-B A.K.A Billy Blam" on March 16, 2003, who claimed that it meant "To be beyond the regular limits of nice. To be nice, and then exceed the status."[1] The user claimed that the term was introduced by the Beastie Boys song "Three MCs & One DJ", which may or may not be the first recorded usage. However, this definition is not the most popular of the 36 definitions submitted for noice. According to users, the term is more likely to mean "Beyond the boundaries and exceeding the limits of nice. Spoken with emphasis when describing something particularly awesome." Although the exact origin of the phrase "the struggle is real" is unknown, the phrase itself is commonly used in rap music to depict hardships the artist has faced. The phrase likely predates the internet. On September 27th, 2011, the hip hop group DTMD released the album Makin' Dollas, which featured a track titled "The Struggle is Real" (shown below). On Monday, May 18th, a user posted a thread stating that describing that the Pepe meme was becoming outdated, and what would be the next meme to follow Pepe. Later in the thread, another anon, who replied with an original drawing of "wofl" drawn on microsoft paint, with the quote "and on this day wofl was inventend." The community quickly warmed up to this "new meme," and different anons began making/posting their own versions. It can usually be found where it originated, on /b/. The quote comes from the TF2 animated short Expiration Date, released on June 17th, 2014. One of the scenes feature Spy training Scout to get a date with Mrs.Pauling, while shouting "Seduce me!" to him to see how would flirt to a girl, resulting on Spy slapping Scout for offering him a bucket of fried chicken. The Bunny Suit was originally developed for the Playboy Club, a chain of nightclubs run by Playboy Enterprises, where the cocktail waitresses on staff would wear the costume.[1] The costume, inspired by Playboy's bunny logo, was designed by Zelda Wynn Valdes, and was first unveiled on the television show Playboy's Penthouse in 1959. It was implemented into the clubs soon after in 1960. On February 5th, 2013, YouTuber Brian Spinney, who describes himself as an Iowan father of two and a devoted Christian, uploaded a music video titled “Rappin’ for Jesus," which he claims to have produced many years ago as a high school student in collaboration with his pastor Jim Colerick at the West Dubuque 2nd Church of Christ in West Dubuque, Iowa. Within three years, the video gained over 10 million views and 34,365 comments.  The image originates from a post in a Facepunch thread entitled "Make funny words/sentences out of a video game/movie/album cover". The image was posted by user RobbL on May 7th, 2012.[1] In versions 1.0.0 to 1.0.4, Greninja was a character that many gamers found to be balanced. However, people who mainly used Greninja began to notice that Greninja's attacks got weaker in the patches after 1.0.4. Better Nerf Greninja became popular mostly from EWNetwork, also known as Etika, and Smashboards, upon noticing the drastic changes. The most notable move that was nerfed was Shadow Sneak, in which a player could no longer be able to dash and Shadow Sneak at the same time, allowing for what is called a "mindgame", where the player confuses the opponent so that they can attack them without retaliation. Voriki is a photoshop of promotional materiel of Toa Tahu. His face is covered up with a purple Pakari Mask from Toa Onua morphed into a star shape with lightning bolts added on the side. This mask is sometimes given the name "Kanohi Gaaha". Various other parts are changed to a purple color as well. He is also frequently seen with a weapon resembling Tahu's firesword, but with lightning bolts at the end and colored purple. This weapon is sometimes referred to as a lightning staff. It is thought that Toa Vorki originated in 2001 on BZPower (then known as BZCommunity ) [2]. However, due to a large data loss on the site, most of the threads predating 2015 have been lost. The oldest know surviving reference to Toa Voriki was by Neoseeker guest user "- Voriki -" in a Bionicle add on story thread [1]. The user posted an image of Toa Voriki with accompanying text reading "Out of the sky, the 7th Toa descended. Wearing Kanohi Gaaha, Voriki the Toa of Energy used his lightning staff to destroy all the Nui-Rama." [1] The origin of the word "RNGesus" is unknown, though it was already in use within in various online gaming communities like MMO-Champion, as early as of 2009[1]. "Daisuke" was written and composed by Japanese musicians Tetsuya Temura and Akira Yokota, known collectively as the electronic group Y&Co., and was included in the soundtrack for Beatmania IIDX 10th Style, released to arcades in Japan on February 16th, 2004.[1] The official music video for this song features BEMANI's in-house dancer/choreographer Daisuke, whom the song is named after[2], doing a highly energetic dance to the song. The music video was uploaded on YouTube by user "TamaKun808" on May 1st, 2006. On December 1st, 2014, an anonymous /pol/ user created a thread discussing the use of anime-inspired illustrations to convert more people to Islam (shown below, left).[1] After some discussion, another user later identified as “Chaby” decided to take the concept of using cute anime-inspired art to proselytize people into Christianity.[3] After some conceptualization, the first visual representation of Christ-chan was unveiled as a blue-eyed European woman wearing a modest blue-green dress and a cross necklace around her neck, with personality traits similar to a stereotypical Christian evangelist (shown below, right). On February 19th, 2013, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance was released in North America for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles. In the game main's campaign, the player control the cyborg mercenary Raiden, who eventually must fight the mercenary Sundowner.[3] Prior to the boss battle, a cut scene is shown featuring a conversation between the two characters, where Sundowner words some phrases like “The Good Old Days Right After 9/11”, "Kids Are Cruel" or "I Keep in Touch With My Inner Kid" (shown bellow, left). During the battle, Sundowner would deploy an explosive shield, sometimes while shouting "I'm Fucking Invincible" (shown bellow, right). The meme originated in a attempt of try make a Brazilian 3D animation of the famous comic and television series Monica's Gang on May 8th, 2014, called ANIMAÇÃO 3D DA TURMA DA MÔNICA (Monica Gang's 3D Animation, in English). The video got popular because of the poorly design and voice. The British slang term "cheeky" is often used to describe someone who is exhibiting charming or irreverent behavior. The exact origin of the phrase "cheeky Nando's" is unclear. The earliest known use was featured in the title of a hip hop track uploaded by SoundCloud user Buzy Ray on November 25th, 2011 (shown below). The comic originally comes from K.C. Green's Gunshow comic #648, actually titled "The Pills Are Working" or "On Fire", originally posted January 9th, 2013. [1] Green's drawings have been the basis of several other memes including Staredad, Dickbutt, Mother of God and I'm Okay With This. The comic, depicts a dog in a room that is burning to the ground. The dog reacts calmly, even as he slowly melts from the heat. On Febuary 26th, 2014, educational YouTube video producers CGPGrey and Brady Haran uploaded the 5th episode of their "Hello Internet" podcast titled "Freebooting" where Mr. Haran introduced the word after claiming the word "infringing" was "soft word" to describe internet piracy. Mr. Haran claimed to have found the word after looking through old English words for sea piracy.[8] The next day, Urban Dictionary[1] user Icanshowyoutheworld submitted an entry for "freebooting," defining it as "taking online media and re-hosting it on your website." On April 1st, 1997, the Pokemon animated series began airing in the Japanese network TV Tokyo. The story follows Ash Ketchum, a ten-year-old boy who goes out on an adventure to realize his dream of becoming a Pokemon master. While the series has been running on a continuous timeline over the course of 19 seasons for more than 18 years, most of the recurring characters, including Ash Ketchum, do not age at all, in the vein of the long-running Not Allowed to Grow Up trope often found across many genres of fiction.[1] On October 30th, 2013, music news magazine Greenroom Magazine published an interview with Fantano on their website, which included a photograph of Fantano doing a rap squat in their eponymous green room.[1] According to the Online Etymology Dictionary,[4] the term problematic was adopted from the French term problematique during the 1600s as a synonym for "doubtful" or "questionable." In the 1960s, use of the term "problematic" increased dramatically according to the Google Books Ngram Viewer[5] (shown below). On August 2nd, 2003, the blog Deeply Problematic[6] was launched, which describes itself as "a feminist blog that seeks to examine and analyze the treatment of problematized bodies in society and the media." On August 8th, 2014, Kent Brantly released his first public statement since contracting Ebola stating that he was "growing stronger every day." Various news outlets wrote about this statement, such as Time,[1] The Guardian,[2] Fox News[3] and Mashable.[4] On August 9th, reddit user Kaithas made a post on /r/funny, where Brantly's statement was jokingly received to define that he was gaining superhuman abilities from Ebola.[9] On August 13th, a thread was made on 4chan's /pol/ board,[5] where one of the posts included an edited version featuring a picture of Brantly with yellow glowing eyes, and the message "American with Ebola: "I'm Growing Stronger"". On December 25th, 2013, Tumblr user K009[2] published the original comic, in which the young girl is shown listening to the 1992 gangsta rap song "Bitches Ain't Shit" by Dr. Dre (shown below).[3] On March 17th, 2013, the "Your Fave is Problematic" Tumblr[3] blog was launched, which features blog posts about various celebrities along with examples of gaffes, jokes or public statements that are perceived as "problematic". The first post featured a list of points about comedian Louis C.K., accusing many of his jokes of being racist or misogynistic (shown below). On May 9th, 2015, British photojournalist Guy Smallman attended a highly controversial parade led by the country's far-right, Islamophobic political group English Defense League (EDL) to cover the event, during which he took a photograph of a Metropolitan Police Service officer with strikingly well-groomed facial hair. Smallman subsequently uploaded the photograph online via his Twitter account[1] using the hashtag #HipsterCop. Within the first 48 hours, Smallman's photograph garnered more than 160 retweets and over 100 favorites. She was created by Know Your Meme user Cat-Monster in and was first posted on the KYM Forums on December 18th, 2009.[1] The image since also became popular outside the forums.[2] "Dindu nuffin" is derived from a phonetic spelling of the phrase "didn't do nothing," a plea of innocence often used in reference to unarmed Black men killed by police. One of the most famous instances of the usage of this phrase can be found in a comic. Detractors often use "dindu nuffins" to refer to sympathizers of the black community. The phrase originated on /pol/ [1] around August 2014, during the riots in Ferguson, Missouri started as a response to the shooting of Michael Brown (shown below).. One of the earliest examples of the practice was in April 29th, 2010, on 4Chan's /a/ board, where several users attempted to derail a thread by posting screenshots from the Retro Spider-Man series[1]. The term "This is Now a Spiderman Thread" was coined on an attempted thread derailment in July 30th, 2010, on 4Chan's /tv/ board[2]. The expression "Chinese cartoons" is in wide use by those unfamiliar with anime subculture and Japanese culture in general, due to the common Western confusion between Chinese and Japanese cultures.[2] The first registered instance of its use to refer un-ironically to anime was a thread on 4chan's anime and manga board /a/. Posted on February 28th, 2008, the post featured a joke about anime elitism and "intellectual animation".[4] The original image macro (pictured below) is based on a stock photograph of an angry looking man holding tangled Christmas lights[4]. On May 28th, 2009, the earliest known instance of the captioned image macro was posted to 4chan's /b/ (random) board.[1] On January 23rd, 2014, The Onion[1] published an article titled "Beautiful Cinnamon Roll Too Good For This World, Too Pure," featuring a picture of a cinnamon roll pastry followed by a description praising its perfection (shown below).

On May 6th, 2015, retired professional basketball player Shaquille O'Neal tripped over a wire on the set of the TNT sports television show Halftime Report (shown below). That day, O'Neal tweeted[1] a photoshopped screen capture of the fall of himself being tackled by a professional wrestler, along with an announcement that whoever posts the "best meme" out of the incident with the hashtag "#ShaqtinaFall" would received $500 (shown below). In the first 48 hours, the tweet gathered upwards of 13,000 retweets and 11,600 favorites. [researching] The Hamburglar[1] villain was first introduced in 1971 in several McDonald's television commercials as a thief wearing a black-and-white shirt and pants, red cape and a wide brimmed hat (shown below). The character was commonly featured in promotions for the fast food restaurant until 2003. On May 6th, 2015, the McDonald's Twitter feed posted a commercial for their new Sirloin Third Pound burger, in which a father wearing a black-and-white striped apron is shown performing various flair tricks with a spatula while grilling hamburgers in his backyard, followed by a voice whispering the Hamburglar's catchphrase "robble robble" (shown below). Wait, is this who we think it is??! https://t.co/rc9xhQrAUi That day, the fast food company released a promotional image for an updated version of the Hamburglar character, who is depicted as a bearded adult man wearing a black trenchcoat, striped shirt and black mask (shown below). On September 20th, 2005, "Photograph" was released as the first single for Nickelback's fifth studio album All the Right Reasons. That year, a music video for the song was released, which begins with Chad Kroeger walking alone on a street while holding up a framed picture of himself and Nickelback's producer Joey Moi as the lyric "Look at this photograph" is heard in the background (shown below). Traditionally, the diet was adopted by people who suffer from a sensitivity to gluten resulting from celiac disease, which is estimated to affect only 1% of adults worldwide.[1] In 2011, cardiologist William R. Davis released the book Wheat Belly, which claims that modern wheat is toxic and urges readers to avoid consuming food with the grain. Within one month, the book became a New York Times bestseller, which has been credited with popularizing gluten free diets among those without celiac disease.[3] Various claims in the book have since been refuted by critics who argue Davis' conclusions are not supported by scientific evidence. On September 11th, 2009, Jordan gave a speech during his Basketball Hall of Fame induction in Springfield, Massachusetts. Throughout the speech, Jordan repeatedly cried while retelling various anecdotes about his career (shown below). Sarah Jessica Parker attended the Met Gala in 2015 in a dress of her own design (in partnership with H&M) and a custom Philip Treacy headdress. At 5:50 that evening, Twitter user JChiron18 tweeted a photo comparing the headdress to Aku, the villain from television series Samurai Jack, with the text "Who wore it better?" The tweet received 247 retweets and 158 favorites. Who wore it better? pic.twitter.com/cWgSFy185Z On April 4th, 2015, Tumblr user ForeverHonest[1] posted a story about a friend who was allegedly ambushed by a gang of assailants wearing t-shirts with the slogan "Down with Cis" while walking down a street and beaten up in the manner of a drive-by assault. As of May 6th, 2015, the post has garnered over 9,000 notes. While the author's intention behind the story remains murky, many readers from all sides quickly began expressing skepticism towards the authenticity of the story, with some interpreting it as a humorous fiction fabricated in the style of "that happened" posts on Reddit and others dismissing it as a satire of anecdotes exposing violence against gender minorities often shared by LGBTQ activists on Tumblr. With speculations running high that the story is most likely a hoax, the t-shirt slogan "Down with Cis" was ironically embraced by members of Tumblr's transgender community, prompting a series of photoshopped images with well-known TV show and meme characters bearing the slogan. On May 2nd, 2015, Washington was photographed at the Floyd Mayweather vs. Manny Pacquiao boxing match wearing an Adidas tracksuit, Yankee baseball cap and a handlebar-style mustache. The next day, users began making jokes about the photograph, noting that the man in the picture did not look at Washington. On May 3rd, Twitter user and comedian TheDiLLon1 tweeted "Hi. I’m Denzel Washington and I have DirectTV. and I’m Uncle Denzel and I’ve got cable," accompanied by a comparison photo of a clean-shaven Denzel. The tweet received 5,864 retweets and 3,898 favorites in about a week. Hi.

On the 3rd of May 2015, TweedlerMcNeepler started streaming on Twitch.tv in Computer Repair. In the stream, TweedlerMcNeepler stated to help a child to fix stream config, instead, TweedlerMcNeepler trolled the child and his dad gave a great reaction. On May 9th, 2012, PTAF released their debut single "Boss Ass Bitch" along with a music video for the track (shown below). In the first three years, the video gained over 17 million views, 178,000 likes and 52,000 comments. Both the phrase and image originate from a scene in My Little Pony episode "The Cutie Map – Part 2",[1] which first aired on April 4th, 2015. In the scene, a pony named Party Favor explains that the rest of the ponies tried to convince him "cutie marks" were good, but he didn't listen. Tooth Tunes are a brand of children's toothbrushes originally released by Tiger Electronics in 2007 and relaunched in 2012 by Arm & Hammer.[1] On December 16, 2013, Arm & Hammer's Canadian branch, Church & Dwight Canada, uploaded a commercial for the toothbrush onto their official YouTube channel. This video gained over 300,000 views as of May 2015. October 15th, 2009, Urban Dictionary[2] user Topgear1 submitted an entry for "dad bod," defining it as "someone who has the body of a dad." The original image (featuring a kid with sunglasses) comes from a stock photo titled "Cool and trendy kid with sunglasses isolated over white background".[1] This image was adopted and used by many other creators of master troles, however other images are often substituted as well. The earliest instance of the complete meme is video by Youtube user blazi93 which features the image coupled with a high pitched voice saying "le master troll" repeatedly for 10 minutes.   The original artwork was painted by Fernando Botero and called Madonna with Child[1] It is done his signature style, known as Boterismo [2] which has certain portions of the figures largely exaggerated. It was finished in 1965. In late 2014, Tumblr user "Hakvryvv" uploaded a cropped image of Jesus from Botero's although the three most popularly reblogged posts have had their source blogs removed, surviving reblogs indicate that the original post gained a total of 170,500 notes in approximately 6 months.[3] The origin of the term "Ooga Booga" is uncertain. Entries on Urban Dictionary[1] offer several interpretations of its meaning, with the most popular definition suggesting that it is slang for Ebonics, a term referring to a variant of the English language unique to the African-American community. The term also has tribal connotations, as demonstrated by one of its first uses in modern popular culture as a sound clip in Crash Bandicoot (shown below).[2] The term "where the white women at?" comes from the 1974 Western comedy film Blazing Saddles, spoken by the character Bart, played by Cleavon Little[3] (shown below). The first known version of this meme was a picture of a goat, labeling pointing to parts of it's anatomy like a normal scientific anatomy diagram would. However, the image used silly terms, such as calling it's eyes "little blinkers" the back legs "Jump sticks" and it's ears "wiggly listeners" The oldest surving copy of this image was posted by the Tumblr blog of Tastefully Offensive [1] on March 11th, 2013 and gained 5,000 notes in 2 years. Another tumbler blog, "princessofworms" later posted the image two months later on May 29th 2013 [2] with the text below the post saying "im a scientist and very important to know goat part". Although this blog has since been taken down, surviving reblogs of this post indicate that it gained 100,000 notes within 2 years. While this version of of the image has been around at least since 2013, prior to it the same image appeared on the internet with the caption "Look at this baby goat he doesn't get in fights over the internet. Be the goat" at least since 2010[4] On April 17th, 2015, an anonymous 4chan user started a photoshop request thread on the /b/ board with a souvenir photograph of himself standing next to the Eiffel Tower, asking "can someone photoshop the eifeltower (sic) under my finger?”[1] (shown below). The post received 319 replies before its archival via 4archive.org[1], where it had received almost 9,000 views by the end of the month. The original image (pictured below, left) comes from a page in Chapter 179 of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 3: Stardust Crusaders[1] (shown below, right), where the characters Jotaro Kujo, Joseph Joestar, Jean Pierre Polnareff, Noriaki Kakyoin and Mohammed Avdol arrive near Egypt after a long journey from Japan and many hostile encounters with enemies. Outside of Japan, the earliest known appearance of the image can be traced back to a Tumblr-hotlinked instance posted by NeoGAF forum member Ezlac on April 4th, 2014, the day when the pilot episode of the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure TV_ anime adaptation premiered.[2]    The first known reference to this copypasta is on the /b/ image board, which is not archived. A question on Yahoo Answers came up in the middle of 2013 when a user by the name of TrovaTravita[1] asked what "gr8 b8 m8 check my 8" meant. The user explained that he did not speak English, and therefore didn't understand its meaning. The earliest screenshot of the phrase is from December 25th, 2013. The original painting is known as "Portrait Of A Young Man". Not to be confused with the more popular "Portrait of The Artist As a Young Man" by renaissance painter Raphael, the painting in question was painted by Italian artist Alessandro Allori in 1561. The painting is currently exhibited in the Ashmolean Museum of Oxford (England).[1] The earliest known instance of the painting being associated with a caption was uploaded on 2011 at WeKnowMemes.[3] On July 17th, 2014, Eric Garner[1], a New York City father of six children and a 400-pound asthmatic man, was put into a choke-hold after apparently breaking up a fight outside a local storefront in Staten Island. Five New York Police Department officers surrounded the father and then forced him onto the ground, while the man continually shouted, "I can't breathe" (clip below).[2] On April 12th, 2015, Twitter user Hannah Atkinson posted a photograph of a Protein World advertisement taken in a London Underground station in London, England, adding that the ad "sums up everything that I despise about how we treat and value women's bodies" (shown below). In the first three weeks, the tweet garnered more than 460 retweets and 400 favorites. On April 15th, Atkinson's tweet was highlighted in a listicle on BuzzFeed[5] titled "Can You Guess What These Sexist Adverts Are Trying To Sell?" On October 31, 2004, user "Asci" of the Russian game development site GameDev.ru posted a topic to the site's forums named "Зацените Гнома." (Check out the gnome). In the thread, Asci posted images of a low-polygon gnome model that he made.[1] Soon after posting, the Gnome became a running joke for the users of the website, who found its low-quality shocked facial expression hilarious. In the original commercial, first aired in June 2011, a husband is caught by his wife making a suspicious phone call at 3 a.m. to an unknown receiver. The husband insists on it being a State Farm insurance agent named “Jake”. Skeptical, the wife grabs the phone and asks what "Jake" is wearing. The scene cuts to a call center where Jake answers sheepishly, "Uh, khakis." (shown below). On April 13th, 2015, principal photography for the upcoming 2016 superhero film Suicide Squad, which is based on DC Comics' anti-hero team with the same name, began in Toronto, Canada.

On July 29th, 2010, a captioned version of the painting was uploaded to the Finnish website Naurunappula.[3] By 2015, the image received over 31,000 views.  Because of the polite and kind character that Isabelle is depicted as in Animal Crossing, fans have always taken Isabelles side in defending her from harm and general insults about her personality. As such, it's not uncommon for Animal Crossing fans to display affection and a need to protect Isabelle online. The meme itself originated from user Goomygoo on Tumblr, when they posted a video of Isabelle being chased down by a Red Shell right before the finish line. The video then goes onto show that, instead of Isabelle being hit, Baby Luigi lands on the Red Shell, for it to explode immediately after. As a consequence, Isabelle is not harmed, and wins the race. (right click, then press play to play videos below!) A second instance of the meme was uploaded to Tumblr by user lustfuldemoness , with Isabelle, once again, being chased by a Red Shell, only this time on Mario Kart 8's remake of SNES Rainbow Road. As a last ditch attempt to rid herself of the Red Shell, she falls off of the track, perhaps intentionally. The video further depicts her somehow bouncing off the Red Shell to safety, as if the track itself didn't want Isabelle to be harmed.  The specific scene in the 2000 DreamWorks movie The Road to El Dorado where Miguel performs his iconic strumming happens when the duo, Tulio and Miguel, attempt to gamble for the legendary map that leads to El Dorado, the city of gold.

While the original image and video submissions featured on Snapchat subsequently faded into ephemera (as intended by the design of the app), many notable examples were soon reposted on other social media sharing sites, most notably on Twitter and YouTube. On April 19th, YouTuber English with Dan uploaded a compilation video titled "Snapchat Story | Riyadh life" (shown below).  Majiresu was a 2chan user who would post under the aforementioned tripcode. At one point in time, a photograph supposedly of him was posted. Although it was later proven to not be Majiresu, the photograph was found to be funny enough to other 2channers to catch on.[1] On February 19, 2015 Tumblr user randomthunk posted a The Stages of PCap Fangirling ("PCap" referring to Peter Capaldi, a British actor who recently took over the role of Doctor Who on the long-running BBC series of the same name.) It identified the three stages and set the template for all future incarnations: first an image of the actor or character smiling and/or being cute, second an image of the same actor or character smoldering, and finally a flailing or otherwise awkward third image. The second caption ("oh no, he's hot") may or may not be a reference to the character Squidward from SpongeBob Squarepants, who delivers the same line via internal monologue in this clip, titled "Squidward's Gayest Moment". The exact origin of the hashtag is unknown, however Kylie Jenner's lips became a subject of teen fascination as the model rose to fame. In a November 15th, 2014, interview with E! News[1], Jenner credited cosmetics for her lip's appearance, stating: "I feel like everyone has been talking about it for months, so I'm kind of sick of it… …My pictures, I pout them out a lot. I think big lips are awesome." Earlier, on October 24th, 2014, Jenner tweeted: how long are we gonna talk about this lip thing lmao The term "Kylie Lips" was later submitted to Urban Dictionary[2] on December 6th, 2014. On January 8th, 2015, makeup tutorial YouTuber Jenna Marbles uploaded a parody video called "Kylie Jenner Lip Tutorial" which jokingly told viewers to use the shot glass suction method to get bigger lips.

According to Urban Dictionary[1], the phrase Yaass came to prominence after a YouTube video that was posted on August 21st, 2013, of a young man screaming at Lady Gaga as she emerges for paparazzi cameras. The video gained 340,854 views as of April 22nd, 2015.

One of the earliest notable utterances of the Takbir on record is attributed to the Islamic prophet Muhammad at the Battle of Badr on March 13th, 624 A.D. In the West, the phrase is often associated with Islamic extremism, largely due to its widespread usage[1] by militant jihadists as a battle cry shortly before or while committing an act of terrorism, most notably during the 9/11 terrorist attacks, as well as its frequent appearance in English-language documentaries, films and other media on the subject. On May 3rd, 2013, the news YouTube channel Global Daily News[10] uploaded a video of be an FSA fighter bringing down an Assad helicopter with a Chinese Fn-6 MANPADS.[11] This clip would later then be used as a clip for "allahu akbar" videos remixes.

Online, the first use of the catchphrase to refer to an anime character was on a 4chan anime and manga board /a/ thread from September 20th, 2011, with a user featuring the quote as response to a Haruhi Suzumiya picture.[1] The Oxford comma was introduced in the 1905 edition of the Oxford University Press Style Guide, where it has remained intact since then.

According to the series lore, The Goddess Hylia created the weapon as The Goddess Sword so that her chosen hero can defeat Demise should he resurrect. When the blade was bathed in the three sacred flames, it was reforged as the master sword. The sword was ultimately embedded in a pedestal within the temple of time so that only the hero of time can claim the blade and unlock its full power[2]. Since A Link to the Past, the weapon has also appeared in other games of the series such as The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (1998), The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker (2002), The Legend of Zelda: Twillight Princess (2006), The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword (2011) and The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds (2013).   It comes from 4chan's shitposting board [s4s], on late 2013. According to Encyclopedia Dramatica,[2] the term "epin" was coined as a shortened form of the phrase epic win in June 2009 on 4chan's /b/ (random) board, where it was spammed repeatedly and accused of being a forced meme. On June 7th, several Urban Dictionary[3] definitions for "epin" were submitted. According to the s4s Wiki,[1] the term "ebin" was subsequently coined as a Spurdo Spärde-style misspelling of epin on the Finnish image board Kuvalauta to avoid bans for posting the word "epic." According to the Tumblr user wehaveallgotknives[5], the first known instance of the #regionalgothic tag on Tumblr was in a post by user clive-gershwin-palmer created on January 13th, 2015.

Eventually he learns that Cosmo's sweat makes the drink taste better, so he adds it as a secret ingredient. Because Cosmo is a fairy however, his sweat has magical properties, causing the lemonade to grant the wishes of those who drink it. In the clip (shown below) where Doug appears, Timmy has just wished everything back to normal, giving up all his money from the lemonade sales. One of the kids who escaped from Vicky's underground lemonade factory emerges and begs for something to drink. Timmy then gives up the last bit of magical lemonade to him, and upon drinking it, he wishes that his father was here. Suddenly, Doug Dimmadome pulls up in a car and it’s revealed that the kid was actually Dale Dimmadome, Doug Dimmadome's long lost son.  This drawing fad was started by a Japanese amateur kemono illustrator kick[9], who illustrates kemono[1] characters of the subgenres called as "Kemo-Homo" (ケモホモ; lit. Gay Kemono) and "Debu-Kemo" (デブケモ; lit. Fat/Chubby Kemono). His illustration of a fat anthropomorphic boar wearing a blue hoodie with a "FAT" logo printed on the front in yellow was posted to his Twitter on February 20th, 2015.[2] It was also reposted to his Tumblr on the 5th of the following month and had earned more than 1,000 notes in its first month.[3] 練習２ pic.twitter.com/IbPUZnhZty — kick (@kick_ra_) February 21, 2015 In April 27th, 1992, Nintendo released Kirby's Dream Land for the Game Boy. In it, King Dedede stole the land's food supply and acted as the final boss of the game. He attacked by swinging his hammer, jumping around, and even uses an inhaling attack. Subsequent fights have been very similar to this, mainly only gaining slight changes. Since then, Dedede has appeared in every Kirby game to date, save for one. He had also appeared as the main antagonist for most of the Kirby anime series, Kirby: Right Back at Ya!. While he still wielded his hammer, he mainly attacked by ordering monsters from a delivery service known as NME (or Holy Nightmare in Japan). In the anime, he was shown as a buffoon, constantly failing in his tasks and even being unable to read. Although the Hex Maniac class first appeared in 2002 with the release of Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire it was not until 2013, when Pokémon X & Y was released, that the modern incarnation of the trainer class appeared.[1] In-game, the class is portrayed by a crazed-appearing young woman with a black dress, disheveled hair, and purple cloth.  The scene originates from the manga Me~teru no Kimochi[1] which was serialized from 2006 to 2007. In the 16th chapter of the manga,[2] the character Tsukimi Okamura has a conversation with the main character Yoshinaga Haruka. In the original manga panels, Okamura replies to Haruka with "No You Don't Understand!" prior to the dog barking. The exploitable swaps these two panels. The Buster Sword is the main weapon belonging to Cloud Strife. The blade originally belonged to 1st class SOLDIER Angeal Hewley which was ordered to be forged by his father. The blade was later entrusted to Zack Fair after defeating Angeal in battle as a symbol his honor and dreams. When Zack was gunned down outside midgar, he entrusted the blade to Cloud while telling him that he is Zack's living legacy. In the main game, The Buster Sword acts as Cloud's default weapon and would appear in cutscenes and minigames despite if Cloud was equipped with a different sword.[2]. Since its appearance, the sword has also appeared in a number of other final fantasy and SquareSoft or Square Enix games.  The catchphrase has often been used on various hentai mangas, becoming infamous for its overuse.   The earliest known instance of Tsundere Shark was submitted by Tumblr user m0x3 on February 21st, 2013.[1] As of April 2015, the image has garnered more than 10,000 notes. The first instance of this meme online was in a series of YouTube commercials made for Skittles in 2011, initially debuting April 5th. The commercials were meant to be watched on the computer, and emphasized the user's closeness to the screen for comedic effect. The word "tsundere" is a portmanteau of the Japanese terms "tsun tsun" (turning away in disgust) and "dere dere" (lovey-dovey feelings).[3] The term was originally found in Bishōjo dating sims and was made popular through the PC adaptation of the visual novel adventure game Kimi ga Nozomu Eien. Since then, it has become a popular term within anime culture to define a wide array of characters that display traits, attitudes, behaviors or actions that exemplify or are similar to the tsundere archetype. On April 1st, 2015, Tumblr[1] unveiled the "Executive Suite 2016 Productivity Edition" 1990's-themed gag office software, which featured an animated assistant named Coppy (shown below). On Tumblr dashboards, the animated character would cycle through various bizarre and humorous messages directed at the user, including "I hope to feel a butt someday" (shown below, left).  The song can be heard in the 49th episode of Steven Universe titled Jail Break, the final episode of the first season released on March 12, 2015[1]. Outside of internet culture, "Mistakes Into Miracles" is a phrase associated with Christianity,[1] where an unexpected circumstance brings about a joyous occasion, i.e. an unplanned pregnancy leading to a happy family. It began spreading as a caption to a series of cringeworthy artworks following a drawing dated November 22nd, 2008, of Sandy Cheeks and Spongebob Squarepants in which Sandy is pregnant captioned "Mistakes Into Miracles." The picture appears to have been originally uploaded to DeviantArt by spongygirl92, who drew mostly Spongebob fanart on DeviantArt from 2008-2012.[2] However, the original post has since been deleted. The earliest extant post appears on Fanpop[3] with what was likely spongygirl92's caption: "spongebob is a daddy. here's sandy pregnant with spongebob being the daddy. i know it's a stupid thing for me to draw." On January 27th, 2012, the Fuck Yeah Pastel Goth Tumblr[2] blog was launched, which highlights notable examples of pastel goth fashion (shown below).  On April 23rd, 2013, the television network Logo TV broadcast the documentary What? I Think I'm an Animal, featuring interviews with teenagers who believe their physical human bodies do not reflect their spiritual animal identifies. In the film, teenager Shiro Ulv (born Matthew Schimmel) states that "On all levels except physical, I am a wolf", followed by a scene in which he is shown barking while looking over a body of water. On May 3rd, 2013, the documentary was posted on the Cringe Channel Forums[3] by user Ahlstrom, who highlighted Ulv's quote. Although the original site where the picture was first uploaded is unknown, the earliest instance of the meme was uploaded on 9gag[1] sometime shortly before September 2nd, 2013. The webcomic-style drawing featured a comparison between the artist and the people around her. The KYMtheon has been known by many different names by many different cultures. The last prior known name was the The Triumvirate. The Triumvirate was eventually defeated by the Meme God himself, Don, whom then created the website Know Your Meme to entrap them and their chaotic energy, known as memes. After this the Triumvirate was believed defeated. However not long after this two heads of the Triumvirate would return in the forms of Super Robo Jesus and The Cheeto. Don was quick to defeat them and send them to the shapeless abyss known as the Deadpool. Don waited in longing for the third head of the Triumvirate to rear it's lewd head, and so it did. After being revived by the power of the Hentai Quotes gallery Goat-tan was born. Goat-tan quickly took control of most of Know Your Meme by tricking Don to engage in a co-op playthrough of Battletoads. Goat-tan proceeded to release both Super Robo Jesus and This Cheeto, forming the KYMtheon.  On May 3rd, 1996, Matthew Aaron Taylor first used the term memeing in the title Fiction, AL, and the Memeing of Life for an online article about memes on the site Telepolis.[8] The article begins with an outline of its topic, saying "Fiction could be understand as a form of artificial life. Perhaps it is the greatest globally networked AL experiment in history. Are fictional characters alive? Are they real? Starting point for a reality check of claims in the field of AL." The article goes on to directly reference the inventor of the term memes, Richard Dawkins, specifically saying "this assertion is not particularly remarkable or original, as it is based on self-evident properties of fiction and on well known ideas that have been advanced by Richard Dawkins, Douglas Hofstadter and others."[8]    The percursors of the crossover can be found with various pairings of each of the characters. On July 4th, 2012 a group named "Merida x Rapunzel" was created on the online artist community DeviantART, [3] and on September 8, 2012 user Redhead-K submitted the first of a series of comics pairing Merida and Hicupp.[5] On September 28th, 2012 youtuber AnimeFanGirl92 uploaded a video called "Merida in Wonderland", which feature supercuts from Rise of the Guardians, Brave, How to Train your Dragon and The Lorax. On October 16th, 2012 youtuber Moloko Cartoons uploaded another supercut video, this time featuring Tangled instead of The Lorax (shown bellow, right). The 1st TV anime season for the manga, Working!!, aired 13 episodes between April and June in 2010. Its opening theme song "SOMEONE ELSE" was composed by Satoru Kousaki[1] who has also composed many songs for the famous animes such as The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, Lucky Star and Monogatari Series, and sung by voice actresses for the main characters Kana Asumi[2], Saki Fujita[3] and Eri Kitamura.[4] Additionally, this opening credit movie is known for the resemblance to "Soramimi Cake", the openig credit movie for Azumanga Daioh. That's because the director for both of the movies is the same person, Kiyotaka Ohata. In the GTA: San Andreas mission "Wrong Side of The Tracks", the protagonist CJ and his partner Big Smoke are ambushed by the Vagos Gang at a train station. CJ is then ordered to chase down the escaping gang members who are on top of a train while Big Smoke attempts to shoot them down. The mission is completed once all 4 gang members are killed before the Train reaches the Fredderick Bridge that connects Los Santos with Las Venturas. Failing to do so will cause the mission to fail and prompt Big Smoke to yell "All we had to do was follow the damn Train, CJ!" (shown below). The 2nd TV anime season for the manga, Working'!! aired 13 episodes between October and December in 2011. Its theme song "COOLISH WALK" was composed by Kakeru Ishihama[1] and sung by voice actresses for the main characters Kana Asumi[2], Saki Fujita[3] and Eri Kitamura.[4] This opening credit movie was created by Kiyotaka Ohata as same as the 1st season. In the movie, after Dr. Mann tricks the spaceship captain Cooper and his crew into coming to his planet, he attempts to escape by docking his ship onto the team's satellite. This attempt ultimately fails because Dr. Mann lacks the training to properly attach his ship onto the satellite. His error causes an explosion that tears some of the satellite apart, killing Mann instantly. Cooper then attempts docking on the satellite. He succeeds in a triumphant scene scored by Hans Zimmer and noteworthy for its special effects. On March 15th 2006, eBaum's World user ebaum uploaded a minute-long video titled Super Power Wheels,[1] which shows a group of friends test driving a variety of Power Wheels-branded toy vehicles under difficult conditions, including one of a young man sliding down a slippery road on a Barbie-themed Corvette for kids. On the following day, the video was uploaded to YouTube (shown below). On December 14th, 2012, the network security blog SecurityMatters[3] reported that a 13-year-old student from Philippines was murdered for replying to a Facebook post with the word "wew." The earliest known use of the phrase "wew lad" was submitted in a thread on 4chan's [s4s][1] (shit 4chan says) board on December 14th, 2013.  On February 1st, 2014 YouTuber The Mighty Jingles uploaded a video of himself commenting on a match featuring Schrader, who quickly died in the match and spent most of the remaining match attempting to convince other players to report his teammate called Jedi for not helping him. The video gained over 372,000 views (shown below). Throughout the video, Schrader tells the opposing team where Jedi is hiding, saying "HE KEMP BUSH," as Jedi was hiding behind a bush for most of the match, and accused Jedi of "Unfair Plane," meaning unfair play. In season 4 episode 92, “Juza of the Clouds Resurrects! I Have No Fear for Raoh!!,” of anime Fist of the North Star that was first broadcasted on October 30th 1986, one of the scenes involved the main protagonist, Kenshiro, hiding inside a cart of hay with the help of his friends in order to cross a bridge rigged with explosives without being seen. Before letting them pass, enemy guards sent an unnamed blond character checking the cart. Upon revealing the hero's face inside, the character looks in surprise at Kenshiro dramatically staring back at him. A Japanese version with English subtitles of that peculiar moment, titled "Death Awaits…", was uploaded to YouTube by Beware the girth! on November 8th 2008 (shown below). One of the first online parodies from that scene was posted to Nico Nico Douga on May 20th 2008[1]. Accumulating to more than 330 000 views as of March 2015 before being taken down, it was a MAD video replacing the original soundtrack from the anime with popular Idol M@ster song 春香 目が逢う瞬間 (Me Ga Au ToKi which means "The Moment Our Eyes Met" in English). A Youtube version was uploaded on March 20th 2010 (shown below, left). Then, on May 22nd, 2008, another Idol M@ster parody featuring a character's face hiding inside another character's hair was posted to Nico Nico Douga[2].

The page has been dormant since December 28th, 2013; it's received almost 18,000 likes as of March 2015. The original text comes from a manifesto referred to as "The Mantra," written by political activist Bob Whitaker, in which he argues that there is an ongoing genocide against the white race and everyone who identifies oneself as "anti-racist" are really biased against the white race.[2] This argument was first featured on the blog "Anti-Racist Canada" on July 21st, 2011.[1] The earliest known glitter bombing occurred on May 17th, 2011, when political activist Nick Espinosa[1] dumped glitter on former Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Newt Gingrich and his wife Callisata in protest of their opposition to same-sex marriage.

On March 23rd, 2015, Paramount Pictures released the full-length trailer for the film Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation[3]. The trailer featured a much-publicized shot where Tom Cruise clings to the side of a military jet as its flying, a stunt that he performed himself, with no green screen or stunt double. Cruise has said repeatedly that the stunt was "undoubtably the most dangerous thing I have ever done." In order to pull it off, he was tethered to the side of the airplane as it took off at over 160 miles per hour; he had to wear special contact lenses to keep his eyes open.[6] On March 25th, 2015, Vince Mancini of Uproxx[1] posted the first series of images created from the promotional poster He also posted a cut-out he created, so that others could use it as a template.

Kantai Collection was released in 2013.[1] In the game, the character Yuudachi was noted to use the word "poi" as a vocal tic many times, probably as a reference to the uncertain fate of the World War II warship the character was based on.[2] The quote is derived from the 1938 novel Alamut by Vladimir Bartol, which tells a fictional account of Hassan-i Sabba, the leader of the Ismailis branch of Shia Islam and founder of the Hashashin order. In the novel, the maxim of the assassin group is written as "Nothing is an absolute reality, all is permitted."

While commenting on the time put into any creation is a recurring habit among people outside of internet, one of the earliest online mentions of anyone genuinely describing the time they took in making a picture using Ms Paint was TRMK forum user Gororules, posting a thread on November 15th 2004 about sprites he made[1]. Then, its first online mention as an hyperbole can be found in a July 2005 thread made on the official Winamp website in which user gaekwad2 commented that the image creation of a desktop by another user "[…] must have takenat (sic) least 500 hours in MS Paint"[2].

Squarepants subsequently finds a grave for a man named Werbenjagermanjensen and returns the hat to the corpse. The first addition to the F-Zero franchise was released in Japan for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System on November 21st, 1990. This game marks the debut of Captain Falcon, who is mostly accommodated by his racing vehicle, the Blue Falcon. Inspired by the Formula One races, Nintendo envisioned Captain Falcon as the flagship character of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, however the plan never was carried out, due to Captain Falcon rarely making appearances across Nintendo media. In F-Zero, Captain Falcon is one of the best racers in the circuit and is a relentless bounty hunter. The first recorded instance of the term on /a/ was on January 1st, 2009[1].

According to "The Complete history of 4chan", a collective effort in listing numerous events related to the imageboard, Christopher "Moot" Pool enabled the Fortune feature on April 27th 2007 by adding a name field on the otherwise anonymous /b/ board. Typing #fortune into it would trigger a random colored message resembling a fortune cookie's prediction above the user's own message. The list also states that one of the first threads involving people trying to guess their own fortune was stickied and became one of the most replied-to thread in the history of the board. There is sadly no available archive from that time. However, one of the earliest mentions of that new feature was found on a video by Youtuber iliekmudkip explaining how to use it on the site, posted July 10th 2007 (shown below). On October 29th, 2014, the "Scream Fortress 2014" update was released for Team Fortress 2, which included the "Carnival of Carnage" map featuring a fictional wizard character named Merasmus.

When crashing against an enemy player, Merasmus would yell the phrase "bonus ducks!" while populating the track with additional golden ducks. Initially, the recording did not have a cooldown and would repeat whenever cars collided. The precise origin of television-themed drinking game images remains unknown. However, the earliest known instance is based on the 2000s American comedy drama series Gilmore Girls, posted by GilmoreGirls.org[4] forum user SydneyGirl in a thread titled “Gilmore Girls Drinking Game” on June 28th, 2006.

The winning post ended up picking Bon Jovi's[2] Livin' on a Prayer.[3] Beatles, a retrospective article on rock group The Beatles, was published on Piero Scaruffi's website in 1999.[1] In the article, Scaruffi makes the claim that The Beatles are overrated by many other critics due to their fame. The copypasta, which was translated to English from its original Italian, is taken from its first paragraph, reproduced below. On August 12th, 2011 the OVA series Carnival Phantasm was released which used the song "Fellows" by Masaaki Endoh[2] as its ending theme.

While it has not been archived, the Giga Nigga nickname is rumored to have originated on imageboard 4chan. Its earliest online mention was on website blol.me[2] in which user Stefanus commented "GIGA NIGGA IS LOOSE!" on a repost of the photoshop, dated July 14th 2011. It shows that the meme had existed prior. In addition, its earliest depiction as a game can be found on Funnyjunk, in a screenshot[3] from August 8th 2011 by user Gardevoir showing an edited version of the photograph being supposedly "defeated" by another user rolling 3,333 (shown below).

They are everything we pass on." In the anime adaptations, Umi-chan has been well-known for her expressive face among fans since the 1st season (shown below, left), and screen shots of her funny faces have been sometimes utilized in photoshopping parodies on Futaba Channel (2chan) since before. Meanwhile, the source footage of this fad is weird facial expressions strucked by Umi during a trump game scene in the 5th episode in the 2nd season "A New Me" originally aired on May 4th, 2014 (shown below, right). Maid outfits are loosely based on that of a typical French housemaid.[1] They often consist of a black dress with white trim, an apron, a lace headdress, stockings, and high-healed shoes. While the French maid outfit is well known in the Western world, it is differenciated from a meido outfit by its emphasis on sexiness rather than cuteness. The meido outfit is extremely popular in Japan. Its popularity began with the adult OVA Kuronekokan, which initially used it as a symbol of subservience.[8] The visual novel Kara no naka no kotori broke this tradition, portraying a "happy" meido, and the Welcome to Pia Carrot series influenced the common perception of the outfit as "cute". In the late 90s, the outfit reached a wider following in the otaku community as maid cafes were formed in cities such as Tokyo.[2] The outfit became a staple of cosplay in the 2000s. The earliest known version of this meme was posted by Tumblr user Glitchicorn on February 4th, 2015,[1] featuring an image with Love Live! character Nozomi Toujou with her hair was replaced with a pattern of Spicy Sweet Chili Doritos.

The exact origin of vertical posting is unknown. The practice is rumored to have originated with "Bravo Nolan", a sarcastic expression coined on 4chan's /tv/ in July 2010. In the KanColle players community, Mutsu's horn-like headgear (shown below, left), which represents the original Nagato-class battleships' booms for maritime signal flags (shown below, right), is sometimes compared to a snail or slug due to the resemblance. Even on the English-speaking web, she's sometimes called as "Mutslug" among fans. Inspired by this iconic item of her, an amateur illustrator blew[2] posted an illustration of a snail version of Mutsu to both Nico Nico Seiga[3] and pixiv[4] on November 17th, 2013 (shown below, left). Then, this creature was named "Rimutsutaka" on his next post (shown below, right) in the following month[5], which name comes from a pun for a backward reading of "かたつむり" (Ka-ta-tsu-mu-ri), a Japanese word meaning of snail, and the name of the battleship girl "陸奥" (Mu-tsu).  On January 25th, 2003, Sony Creative Software released version 1.0 of Sony Vegas Pro,[9] which displays the phrase "Sample Text" when adding a text overlay in a video clip, indicating that the user can customize the type.

Among the earliest known usages of the term was in the film The Garbage Pail Kids Movie, which was released on August 21st, 1987 (clip below). One of the earliest written uses of the term comes from the book Treating the Alcoholic: A Developmental Model of Recovery by Stephanie Brown, where it is used to describe non-alcoholic individuals.[23] A derivative of the English adjective "normal," the term "normie" first came into colloquial usage in the context of mental health-related discussions sometime in the mid-to-late 1990s, with its earliest known mention dating back to April 1996 on the personal website of James L. Drush, an addiction recovery counselor, in a web page[1] that explains the common characteristics of a "normie." The earliest known Urban Dictionary entry[1] that addresses the pejorative use of the word was submitted on February 15th, 2004, defining "normy" as "someone who is normal, bland." On February 8th, 2015, the 57th Grammy Awards were held at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, California,[5] where the Album of the Year award was given to Hansen for his album Morning Phase, beating several others including Beyoncé Knowles' self-titled album. As Beck went on the stage to receive the gramophone-shaped trophy from his fellow rock musician Prince, Kanye West popped up on stage unannounced and began approaching the microphone, shortly before shaking his head in jest and returning to his seat, reminiscent of his interruption of pop star Taylor Swift during the 2009 MTV Music Awards. On February 25th, 2015, Tumblr user swiked[1] posted a photograph of a dress asking the science side of Tumblr to help identify its colors, noting that her friends were torn between it being white and gold or black and blue.

The earliest notable example of the meme was created by Patrick King and posted to his Tumblr blog on July 25th, 2014.[1] It features an edit of the movie's trailer, replacing Grey's BDSM room with a room filled with merchandise from the My Little Pony franchise. The post was linked to on the /r/mylittlepony subreddit on the same day,[2] garnering 512 points (92% upvoted) before being archived. On April 13th, 2005, the first installment of the Loose Change[1] film series was released, which argued that the September 11th, 2001 attacks were orchestrated by the United States government. The film claims that the burning fires within the World Trade Center towers would not have been hot enough to compromise its structural integrity, alleging that a controlled demolition actually brought down the two buildings. The earliest known iteration of the joke was done by Zach Galifianakis in his 2006 comedy special Zach Galifianakis Live at the Purple Onion, released on DVD in March 2007. When you look like I do, it's hard to get a table for one at Chuck E Cheese. I went to my stylist today and she said, "what are you looking for?" and I told her, "Just give me the Amber Alert." On August 13th, 2012, rapper Tyler, The Creator posted a tweet mocking Miley Cyrus' new short haircut, joking that the pop star requested her stylist to "fuck me up real quick" (shown below). The following day, Cyrus responded to the tweet by insulting the rapper's face but complimenting his music (shown below).[9] The tweets were subsequently deleted. On February 22nd, 2015, Travolta posed for a photograph with Johansson during the red carpet ceremony at the 2015 Academy Awards. That evening, Hollywod photographer Kevin Mazur released the photographs to the celebrity photo website WireImage[8] (shown below). During the ceremony, Travolta's overly affectionate gestures became one of the talking points of the evening, as he was also seen kissing Idina Menzel on the forehead while making a joint appearance on stage to redeem himself for last year's "Adele Dazeem" flub. This meme began from a poorly-drawn fan illustration for Suiseiseki which was posted to Futaba by an anonymous user circa Autumn of 2004 (Shown below, left). Due to tis funny look, this character quickly became popular in Futaba's threads related to Rozen Maiden which first TV anime series were gaining much popularity amongst the users, and it was originally given a nickname "Half-remembered Suiseiseki" (うろ覚え翠星石, Uro-oboe Suiseiseki). Then, the name "Jissouseki" was given to this character after that illustration was used in the "What operations installed" panel in a Suiseiseki version of the Tree Swing Cartoon Parody (shown below, right), which name is a compound word of Suiseiseki and "Jissou" (実装), a Japanese translation of "Install". According to Jissouseki wiki, this Suiseiseki version was posted on December 30th, 2004. The original phrase "Are you going to finish that croissant?" was used by Carl Wheezer in Season 3, Episode 1 of The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius, "Lights! Camera! Danger!," in response to series' villain Professor Calamitous, impersonating film director Quentin Smithee. One of the earliest comedic uses of the phrase dates back to a comment posted by LurkerFAQs[1] forum member SADsyn in a thread titled "breasts" on June 22nd, 2011. In the thread, forum member SADsyn wrote: Why are you guys discriminating against hairy breasts? MLK didn't die for this. For people to have this type of mentality. That hairy breasts shouldn't be accepted along with the hairy breasts. You all ought to be ashamed with yourselves. On August 29th, 2013, The first notable pairing of the phrase with an image was submitted by Twitter user @ambessadc[4], which featured a photograph of an automatic pencil sharpener with a sticky note that reads "No Colored Pencil" (shown below). In a Twitter exchange with Twitch employee Hassan Bokhari[2] held in July 2014, Kreyg submitted the original kreygasm photo to the video streaming service several years prior (shown below). According to an email from Kreyg sent to Know Your Meme staff, a Justin.tv admin approached Kreyg in March of 2011 to have his likeness made into a global chat emoticon. In August of that year, the term "kreygasm" was coined during one of Kreyg's Twitch streams. Kreyg subsequently took a photo of himself and submitted it to Twitch to become an emoticon (shown below). On September 3rd, 2011, a thread about Twitch emoticons was updated with several new faces that had been added, which included the kreygasm face.[6] On January 6th, 2015, then Vice President Joe Biden swore in the newly and re-elected members of the U.S. Senate, including Chris Coon, the second-term senator of Delaware from Biden's home state. As part of the custom, each senator's oath of office is usually followed by a group photo opportunity with his/her family and the vice president. As Biden, Coon and his family awkwardly posed for the photo op, the vice president was seen whispering something to Coon's daughter before trying to give her a kiss on the cheek, which she coyly fended off by pulling away. The animated GIFs of the awkward exchange was quickly entered circulation online via Twitter, as well as political news blogs like Mediate[7] and BuzzFeed. [8] On February 17th, 2015, Redditor gaylord__focker uploaded a photograph of Biden whispering into the ear of Stephanie Carter, the wife of the newly appointed U.S. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter, in a post titled "Biden strikes again at new Def Sec swearing in speech" to the /r/cringepics[1] subreddit (shown below, left). Within one week, the post gained over 5,000 votes (96% upvoted) and 700 comments. The Snoo was originally created by Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian and has stood as the mascot of the site since its initial launch on June 23rd, 2005.[1][2] It is displayed in many areas of the site, including the header and 404 pages.[3] The name "Snoo" is a derivative of 'Snew.com, an early name for Reddit prior to its launch (shown below).[8] On February 22nd, 2015, Lady Gaga walked the red carpet at the 87th Academy Awards while wearing a white Azzedine Alaia dress and red leather gloves (shown below, left). Shortly after, Twitter user Jon-Michael Poff[1] tweeted a photograph of a pair of red grill gloves juxtaposed next to a picture of Lady Gaga on the red carpet, gaining over 450 retweets and 380 favorites in the first 24 hours (shown below, right).  On March 2nd, 2014, Idina Menzel made an on-stage appearance at the 86th Annual Academy Awards ceremony for a live performance of the song, with an introductory remark from actor John Travolta who ended up severely mispronouncing Menzel’s name as “Adele Dazeem.”  On March 8th, 2013, North Korea's government-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) broadcasted footage of Kim inspecting a military facility in Jangjae and Mu Islets near the demilitarized zone. In the footage, the North Korean dictator is shown intensely peering at South Korean islands across the border through a pair of binoculars (shown below). The song was performed in the film Frozen[3] by American actress and singer Idina Menzel in her role as Queen Elsa (shown below). The song appears after an ostracized Elsa abandons her kingdom soon after her cryokinetic powers are discovered by the public. Realizing that she no longer needs to hide her incredibly powerful icy abilities anymore, Elsa declares herself free from the obstacles that she's been faced with since childhood and rejoices in using her powers without fear. As of January 2014, the music video has garnered more than 31 million views. On December 5th, 2011, YouTuber Dikekike uploaded a video titled “The Fesh Pince Of Blair,” featuring heavily-edited scenes from the early 90s American sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. The original video has since been removed, but a mirror version was later uploaded by the same author under the new handle KroboProductions[1] on October 22nd, 2013, gaining over 300,000 views, 6,115 likes and 1,400 comments within two years.

As the name suggests, the series can be seen as the diminutive cousin of Insanity Wolf. On June 20th, 2012, the baby wolf photo was posted to Baby Animal Zoo by a user named Zookeeper Joe[3]. That same day, the photo was featured in a blog post titled "Awooo! You’ll Howl For These Wolf Pups" by Zookeeper Joe.[4] Previous to that, on June 20th, 2011, a cropped version of the same photograph was uploaded as part of a post titled "End Lethal Wolf Management" on the site BTC4Animals.com.[5]  The first known online use of the phrase can be traced to a quote posted by Neoseeker forum member The Crow in a professional wrestling role-playing thread on July 3rd, 2004. On August 17th, 2014, Twitter user @oshirukouji uploaded a side-by-side doppleganger image highlighting an apparent visual similiarity between Paras and Chiyo Sakura. The accompanying text roughly translates to “I cannot forgive an Otaku who calls Sakura Chiyo-chan a Paras." 佐倉千代ちゃんの事をパラスって言ったヲタク絶対に許せねぇ pic.twitter.com/1PwssyQlsr  Gandhi’s obsession with nuclear bombing in the series was first noted in the sequel title Civilization II, wherein India would often evolve into the most hostile civilization during the mid to late stages of a match. Cause of this was a glitch in the artificial intelligence (A.I.) settings for Gandhi's aggression level. Despite starting with the lowest level of aggression to reflect Gandhi's historical legacy of pacifism, as the game progresses towards the Modern Era the Indian civilization would often become more hostile and confrontational towards other leaders as a result of a coding error. At that point in the game Gandhi's already low aggression value would lower into a negative value in the game's code, at which point the error caused Gandhi's aggression to underflow into the highest setting just as the level of military aggression begins to wane across the world in the game, going from 0 to 255. With the advents of strategic nuclear weaponry in the Atomic Era, Gandhi's hyperaggression typically leads to rampant threats and use of nuclear bombs on other civilizations, earning him an odd reputation of being a nuke-obsessive warmonger. Due to the popularity of the bug, it was later intentionally put into later iterations of the game where Gandhi would intentionally be given the highest level as a producer and user of nukes.[2] Throughout the film Memento, originally released on March 16th, 2001, the protagonist Leonard Shelby (played by Guy Pearce) writes notes to himself in order to keep track of important information that he would otherwise forget due to the memory loss caused by anterograde amnesia. In one of the pivotal scenes, Shelby is seen writing “don’t believe his lies” on the backside of an instant film of a man named Teddy (played by Joe Pantoliano) after identifying him as a suspect of the man he is looking for. On January 9th, 2012, Redditor SWozniak submitted a post titled "Don't believe his lies," featuring three screen captures of the Memento scene with video game designer Peter Molyneux photoshopped on to the Polaroid (shown below). Prior to being archived, the post gained over 1,400 votes (88% upvoted) on the /r/gaming[3] subreddit. The 50th episode of Strong Bad Email in Homestar Runner titled '50 emails' was posted on Monday, November 11, 2002. In this episode, Strong Bad answers 50 emails in celebration of his 50th sbemail until he gets interrupted with a important phone call at Email #3. Homestar Runner walks in with Strong Bad's fondue pot and then reads his emails. When Homestar Runner gets to Email #4 about a common question of Strong Bad typing with his boxing gloves on, he knows what to do and types BALEETED as he is spelling 'Deleted' wrong. The list goes on that rhymes with BALEETED until he hits a Fragrant System Error. The oldest retrievable use of the image on 4chan can be traced back to April 28th, 2014, when it was posted on the /r9k/[10] (ROBOT9001) board, referring to normal people as 'normalfags'. The oldest known usage of the term dates back to 2009[1] in a thread about the anime Clanned. A user posted in the thread "Maybe you faggots wouldn't have to baaww if you realized that it's all forced drama with horribly generic character design and stopped watching this utter shit." to which another responded "STOP LIKING WHAT I DON'T LIKE GOD DAMN IT." On May 11th, 2008, Ontario, Canada resident Dorothys Hays took two photographs and a video of a black bear trespassing on her property in Kakeda Falls (shown below). On December 2nd, 2009, the Get Bear Smart YouTube channel uploaded Hays' video in which the bear is shown seated at a wooden table in her backyard. On August 15th, 2008, the Demotivational Posters website Motifake[1] highlighted an image of the bear with the caption "Picnics. This bear likes them" (shown below). The earliest archived instance of the phrase "your favorite anime is shit" dates back to a 4chan thread on the /a/ (Anime & Manga) board.[3] However, discussions about one's favorite anime have resulted in snide remarks already before that, making it impossible to date the actual start of the phrase. The original panel comes from the Fate/Zero Doujinshi: Fubin Sugiru Zero Saber ga Ijikeru[1] (Translation: A Very Pitiful Zero Saber Grows Timid) by Hiroyuki,[2] which was first published in October 2012. On February 8th, 2015, Rihanna entered the red carpet ceremony at the Grammy Awards in a pink haute couture dress designed by Italian fashion couturier Giambattista Valli. That evening, Twitter user @CalandCo[1] tweeted a picture of the pop star posing on the red carpet juxtaposed next to a photograph of a pink loofah sponge (shown below). According to the Fanlore Wiki,[7] the earliest known use of the term "one true pairing" was featured in a 1984 summary of the zine Alternaties #2, which discussed various Star Trek pairings. "This zine has something for everybody…The stories are mostly Spock-centric, so if you love a certain Vulcan, this one's for you!…And boy, does he get around -- we have Kirk/Spock, Spock/McCoy, Spock/Chapel, Spock/and various others, including T'Pring…And of course, more Kirk/Spock, because we all know that's our one true pairing!!!…Variety is the spice of life -- and this zine is extremely spicy."  In 1969, the funk-soul music group The Winstons released the song "Amen, Brother" as a B-side opposite of the track "Color Him Father." The drum beat occurs at 1:26 in the song and is separated from all other instruments (shown below). In 1986, the six-second beat was compiled into the bootleg series Ultimate Breaks and Beats[4] by Louis "Breakbeat" Lou, featuring a variety of clips to be used with the new sampler musical instruments. Throughout the 80's and early 90's, the sample was widely incorporated in the rapidly growing electronic dance movement, specifically in the breakbeat and jungle genres. On June 26th, 2002, JungleScene Forums[8] member junglebastard submitted a thread about the sample. The first cover appearance modifying Kirby's facial expression in North America was Kirby & the Amazing Mirror (星のカービィ 鏡の大迷宮), released on October 18, 2004 for a 32-bit handheld video game console, Game Boy Advance [2]. Certain archives show that, on 4chan, earliest posts saying that Hitler "did nothing wrong" can be dated back to June 29th, 2011[2]. The full phrase though had been used since at least January 30st, 2012[1], when the No.377777777 GET post had contained the phrase. According to Wikitionary[1], the term originated in skateboarding and snowboarding slang as a variation of "handplant," an intentional trick move in which the rider balances on one hand. On May 20th, 2003. Urban Dictionary[3] user Klepto submitted an entry for "face plant." Originally titled "Sad Romance", the instrumental song was written by South Korean composer Ji Pyeongkeyon for the soundtrack of the 2003 Korean TV drama Over the Green Fields (저 푸른 초원위에), which was released in late 2002 (shown below, left).[1] Later on, Ji also composed a string arrangement of the original song (shown below, right), which has become the most frequently sampled version, particularly in the case of montage parodies. The still shot originates from Season 1, Episode 3 of The Brave Fighter of Sun Fighbird[1] (太陽の勇者ファイバード) (or simply Fighbird), which first premiered in Japan in February 1991, in a scene where Yutaro Katori, a human android created by professor Hiroshi Amano, misidentifies a butterfly as a pigeon while studying the earthly nature. In addition to mistaking a pigeon for a butterfly, Katori also confuses Rosaceae with Violaceae (shown below). On Tumblr, the quote has been occasionally misinterpreted as an example of transcription FAIL, however, it is the direct translation of the original line in verbatim: In the 1980s, the adult magazine Hustler ran a monthly feature titled "Beaver Hunt," which featured reader-submitted photographs of nude women, some of whom subsequently sued the magazine for publishing the photos without their consent. In 2000, Italian researcher Sergio Messina coined the term "realcore" for pictures and video of ex-partners that were shared in Usenet groups.[1]  On February 21st, 2014, illustrator Jim Benton[7] posted an original comic on Reddit in which a young girl is granted the power to speak with ponies by a magical fairy.

Shortly after the conclusion of the halftime show, the awkwardly dancing "left shark" quickly emerged as a trending topic on Twitter and elsewhere. In response to the explosion of selfie stick users at tourist destinations around the world there were numerous articles posted online during 2014 featuring pictures of people taking pictures of themselves with a selfie stick. The vast majority of these articles were aimed at deriding the user of the selfie stick. In January 2015 the term 'selfie stickhead' was coined and the domain name www.selfiestickheads.com[1] was registered. On January 26th, 2015, Redditor maverick__7 submitted a photo of an elk in front of a mountain titled "I love living in Colorado because I can take pictures like this half an hour from my house" to the /r/pics[1] subreddit (shown below).

The precursor to the camera arm is commonly known as a monopod[2]; they were initially used to provide support for cameras, binoculars, firearms and variety of other objects, but later this use evolved into providing extension for camera's in order to obtain difficult angles for shooting. The earliest known use of a monopod to take a selfie photograph was sent to BBC News[3] by Whitehaven, England resident Alan Cleaver, showing his grandfather taking a photo with his grandmother with a extended pole (shown below). However, many have noted that the "selfie stick" in the picture is simply a pole used to activate the shutter. On April 18th, 2011, the "HDE Extendable Selfie Telescopic Monopod" was placed for sale on Amazon.[4]  The original ASCII is created out of 5 unicode symbols including: Light Shade "░" – 0×2591, Dark Shade "▓" – 0×2593, Full Block "█" – 0×2588, Upper Half Block "▀" – 0×2580 and Lower Half Block "▄" – 0×2584.

In October 2014, posters in the /r9k/ (robot 9000) board on 4chan began submitting green text stories featuring an autistic, overweight son who terrorizes his parents into getting him specific foods and frequently complains about 'normies' (shown below).[1] On January 19th, 2015, an /r9k/[7] user submitted a thread asking for posts "putting normies in their place," to which several users replied with various stories about an adult man who lives with his parents and earns "good boy points" by doing household chores and practicing good hygiene. Other stories contained mentions of the son referring to chicken tenders as "tendies." The phrase "Yuri Goggles" is claimed to be originated by Okazu founder Erica Friedman.[1] The definition of "Yuri Goggless" on the site's website is: "A phrase coined by Erica for the process through which fans make Yuri where there is little or none in the actual series. Similar to “beer goggles,” Yuri goggles make a series or a couple seem more Yuri the higher you turn them up." The usage of the phrase on the site dates back to at lest 2004, with the site's review of Madlax [2] On January 24th, 2015, a user on 2channel's /news4vip/ board[1] submitted a thread titled "Let's make ISIS into a moe girl and send it to them!" with the intention of Google-bombing the search engine's image search results for "ISIS" with anime character illustrations." Soon, the physical features and personality of the proposal character were determined through "anchor designation," a popular forum game in which the specifications of a proposed idea are randomly selected through a lottery of specific post numbers as pre-designated by the original poster. Within first three hours, the post garnered 1,000 replies. <Profile of ISIS_chan> Name: ISIS_chan Clothes: Black (like ISIS’s uniforms) Hairdo: Short hair Hair color: black Age: 19yo Skin color: Brown Bust size: Big Height: small (about 150cm) Eye color: Green-ish Favorite foods: Muskmelon (from Japan) According to Merriam-Webster[1] dictionary, the first known usage of the word "lewd" dates back to 14th century England word "lǣwede," meaning "vulgar," originating from the Old English word "lewed," meaning "laical" or "ignorant."

On February 8th, 2008, an anonymous user of 4chan's /a/[4] made a comment on forced lewd scenes in anime breaking the 4th wall and pulling them out of the story, offering one of the earliest known uses of the term on 4chan (shown below). That year on November 19th, an anonymous /jp/[3] user uploaded one of the oldest known lewd reaction images (shown below, left) featuring an image of Eiki Shiki from the anime Touhou Project holding up a sign reading "too lewd," likely based on a comic where she describes Komachi Onozuka's breasts as "lewd" (shown below, right). On May 11th, 2011, YouTuber austinscooter88 uploaded a video titled "Kid Screaming At Black Ops PART 2", featuring a recording of a boy playing Call of Duty: Black Ops while screaming and getting angry, and gaining over 1 milion views in the following five years. The phrase comes from the Nostalgia Critic epsiode about The Care Bears movie, on May 11th, 2010.[1] On the minute 12:36 of the video, the bears defeat a giant eagle using rainbows, when "TASTE THE RAINBOW MOTHERFUCKER" is heard. The next day, user Deutsodo uploaded a the scene. As January 26th, 2015 the video has over 430000 views.[2] The earliest known forum game of this type was posted by PbNation Forums[1] user Mon.Star on January 29th, 2008, when he asked viewers to "describe your sex life using a movie title" (shown below). Over the next six months, the post gained over 840 responses. In the film The Avengers, the quote appears in a scene wherein S.H.I.E.L.D operative Nick Fury (portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson) rhetorically asks his team how the villain Loki was able to mind control two of his agents as if they were the winged monkeys from the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz. While most other superheroes are unable to process the dated pop culture reference, Captain America (portrayed by Chris Evans), whose canonical setting overlaps with the time period when the film was originally releases, smugly responds by saying that he "understood that reference". Nick Fury: "I'd like to know how Loki was able to use [the Tesseract] to turn two of the sharpest men I know into his personal flying monkeys." Captain America: "I understood that reference." The earliest known fan art tribute to the quote was submitted by Redditor GeneralBacon in a /r/funny post[11] titled "that awesome moment when" on May 22nd, 2014.

Bee Shrek Test in the House was created as a counter to the Rise of the Brave Tangled Dragons fandom, a crossover of Brave, Tangled, How To Train Your Dragon, and Rise of the Guardians, which gained huge amounts of popularity on tumblr in late 2012. A percursor of the fandom can be found on December 29th, 2012, when youtuber Byakuya Togami uploaded a video titled "GREEN AND YELLOW – a love story, shrek x barry", featuring a fanfiction pairing Shrek and Barry. On March 31st 2013, an Tumblr blog called "Bee Shrek Test in the House" was created,[5] reblogging a post from user vanvonsch featuring a Rise of the Brave Tangled Dragons styled image with Shrek, Cory, Barry and Johnny.[6] The post got over 26,000 notes on two years. On January 20th, 2015, Islamic State released a new video on YouTube in which a masked member threatens to kill Japanese hostages Kenji Goto Jogo and Haruna Yukawa within 72 hours unless Japan pays $200 million in ransom.[1] In response, some Japanese Twitter users didn't call on the government or express anger at the terrorist acts, but began posting parody images mocking the IS video around that day's evening. One of the earliest instances made by @AKID_0831 had retweeted 7,700 times and got over 5,000 favorites within first 7 hours.[2] The earliest online usage of the phrase can be found in a review for the movie A Serbian Film on The Sydney Morning Herald in which the review states "the censored version is still ''at the upper limit of the R18+ category'' for its ''high-impact sexual violence, sex scenes and violence'', Classifications Australia says."[5] Another early instances of the meme can be found in a thread[1] posted on 4chan's /v/ board on February 22nd, 2014, in which users discussed Australia's classification of the PlayStation Vita version of the 2010 roleplaying video game Atelier Totori: The Adventurer of Arland as having an R-18+ (18 years old and up) rating because of "references to sexual violence", a significant leap from the rating of PG that was given previously to the non-PS Vita version. The thread resulted in the creation of an image captioned "High Impact Violence" (shown below).[2] On January 6th, 2015, Calvin Klein released a black-and-white advertisement in which Bieber is shown playing the drums and embracing model Lara Stone (shown below).

While the exact origin of the term "script kiddie" is unknown, the hacker zine Phrack[2] used the term in Volume 8, Issue 54 released on December 25th, 1998 when discussing the practice of "Remote OS detection vis TCP/IP Stack FingerPrinting." "Then when someone posts (say) a root hole in Sun's comsat daemon, our little cracker could grep his list for 'UDP/512' and 'Solaris 2.6' and he immediately has pages and pages of rootable boxes. It should be noted that this is SCRIPT KIDDIE behavior."   While similar hide-covered, voice-changing windpipes have been used for ceremonial purposes in Africa for hundreds of years, one of the most prevalent rumored stories[1] behind the invention of the instrument points to an African-American resident from Macon, Georgia named Alabama Vest, who apparently came up with the device circa 1840. However, there is no documentation to support that claim.[2] The earliest documentation of the instrument on record attributes Warren Herbert Frost, an American inventor, as the applicant and owner of the U.S. patent #270,543 issued on January 9, 1883. Since its emergence in the late 1800s, the instrument became popularized through its use in country songs and other genres of music. In July 2008, a congregation of Christian youth groups at the 2008 EFCA Challenge Conference set a new Guinness world record for the world's largest kazoo band performance.

If no, is it possible to imagine the inner life of the characters surrounding him or her?" On January 15th, 2015, AMPAS president Cheryl Boone Isaacs made an on-stage appearance at the Oscar Nominations ceremony to announce the nominees in upcoming 87th annual Academy Awards, scheduled to take place on February 22nd. While reading the list of nominees for the Achievement in Cinematography award, Issacs fumbled on the pronunciation of Dick Pope, the cinematographer for Mr. Turner, and referred to him as "Dick Poop." Although she promptly corrected herself, Issac's gaffe opened up a massive opportunity for toilet humor online.  The earliest known image macro featuring the expression was a 60s Spider-Man image depicting the superhero pointing next to two police officers laughing with the caption "Look at him / Look at him and laugh" (shown below).

While the exact origin of the idiomatic expression "that's enough for today" remains unknown, the earliest recorded use of the phrase in the context of Internet browsing can be found in the title of a video uploaded by Vimeo user Ionut Puiu on August 20th, 2009. Dubbed “Trust me… You had enough Internet for today,” the video shows a cat pawing its owner's typing hand on the keyboard in the style reminescent of Stop Posting reaction images (shown below). The meme originates from multiple still scenes taken from the first incarnation of the Yu-Gi-Oh anime released in 1998, which feature Joey Wheeler with a creepy smile and a pointy chin On June 11th, 2013, two trailers for the upcoming game "Super Smash Bros. for the 3DS/Wii U" were unveiled during a Nintendo Direct presentation, which included an announcement for a playable Villager from the Animal Crossing video game series.[1] As Villager captures Nintendo mascot Super Mario in his net, the screen then turns orange as the words "Villager Comes to Town!" appear on the screen (shown below).

The match ended in Oregon's 59 – 20 victory against Florida State, which also set a new record for most points ever scored in a Rose Bowl match. The oldest known archived post containing the original derivative (pictured below)[1] can be dated back to June 2nd, 2011, to a thread on 4chan's /tv/ (television and film) board, whose purpose was to make fun of the style of humor of the television show The Big Bang Theory. During the whole episode, King Ramses repeats over and over "Return the slab!" while Eustace repeats "What's your offer?", trying to strike a deal with Ramses so he can get some money. When the second curse starts, a record player hiding behind a huge rock outside the house starts playing awful disco music and the characters start screaming and cover their ears. The repetitive lyrics are "The man in gauze, the man in gauze, King Ramses! The man in gauze, the man in gauze, he's no Santa Claus!" In an interview with Cartoon Cartoon Fridays: The Fan site and the show's music composer Jody Gray, he spoke about the song: "CCF: The Fansite: What influenced the song in the episode King Ramses' Curse? J. Gray: It's a musical joke. When trying to visualize what would be musically so horrible that Eustace and Muriel would scream and writhe in agony, we came up with really bad disco. Here are the lyrics: "King Ramses, The Man In Gauze, He's No Santa Clause, The Man In Gauze." Vocals were done by myself and Andy Ezrin."  The phrase origin dates back to 2012, with paul mccartney´s appearance at the grammys which prompted multiple tweets questioning his identity[13] However the phrase didint took off until 2 years later.

In our free time, we made the game. We ended up sharing the game on Facebook amongst our friends for free. Everyone we knew loved the game and thought it was so funny. We then asked some people on Miiverse what they thought of the game. The reaction from the younger audience was amazing, thus we want to bring the game to the Wii U. Me and my brother wanted to make the game very difficult to beat, and the trailer doesn't even showcase all of the crazy events that happen during the song so you will just have to play it for yourselves to find out how crazy the game gets."

The attached image shows Fez (portrayed by Wilmer Valderrama) of That '70s Show attempting to seduce Jackie's mom. In the following months, a number of variations on the same theme began to surface on Twitter as the end of the semester approached. The original site was made by prairiedogeric10 on November 19th, 2008, Prehistoric Dinosaur introduces himself prairiedogeric10 liked the concept of the moon man fad, he took a gif from the famous website pogo from the dinosaur, know as a zoppa from the club pogo and poppa zoppa and used a tts voice. AT&T Mike TTS. The Prehistoric Dinosaur Really hates longnecks and saying that will murder him.   The phrase stems from the account as provided by Dorian Johnson, a friend of Brown who was with him that day, initially to the news media outlets in August 2014 and later before the grand jury in September. According to Johnson's account: Wilson approached them by the sidewalk in his police SUV and told them to stop, to which Brown and Johnson replied that they were close to home and would shortly be out of the street. Wilson then blocked their pathway and attempted to detain Brown through the window of his vehicle, leading to a physical struggle between the two, during which Wilson drew his weapon and said "I'll shoot you" or "I'm going to shoot" before firing his weapon at Brown. As Brown and Johnson began to flee from the police car, Wilson fired several more rounds at Brown, who then turned around with his hands raised and said, "I don't have a gun. Stop shooting!" Wilson then shot Brown several more times, killing him. The slogan "hands up, don't shoot!" was coined by St. Louis protesters, including Hands Up United, a police watchdog activist group based in Ferguson, Missouri formed in the wake of Michael Brown's death, and spread across the country in the following days of the week.[2] On November 22nd, 2014, the day after the official release of Pokemon Omega Ruby & Alpha Sapphire, Twitter user @kuroarivega[4] tweeted an illustration of a Mudkip juxtaposed next to the in-game avatar of Marshstomp as portrayed in the game, while noting that the evolved form of the Pokémon had the “eyes of a killer” (shown below). In the first two weeks, the tweet gained over 100 retweets and 60 favorites. The phrase originates from a PowNews video coverage from October 8, 2013 about "Docentendag", a teacher appreciation day, where a student shows his appreciation by saying "Ik neuk jullie allemaal de moeder" which is incorrect Dutch for "I fuck all of your mothers". The phrase has been used as an rhetorical device for centuries, long before the invention of the Internet. The earliest known usage of the expression on record can be found in a quote attributed to the 19th-century American novelist and writer Mark Twain:[3] One of the earliest parodies of this expression, and possibly the original instance of the meme as it exists today, can be traced to the widespread binary computer joke which goes: "there are only 10 types of people in the world: those who understand binary, and those who don't."   On September 19th, 2014, artist David Malki published a comic titled "The Terrible Sea Lion" on his webcomic site Wondermark,[1] which features a sea lion who intrudes on a private conversation to debate a woman saying she "could do without sea lions" (shown below). On the 4th of April, 2013, YouTube user PilotRedSun uploaded a video entitled "Garfielf". The video consists of various MS Paint renderings of Garfield and Jon being voiced by the VoiceForge text to speech narrators Wiseguy and Jerkface, respectively.[1] The video also contains the psychedelic rock song "Coc'n Rolla" by Begnagrad.[7] On November 30th, 2014, the Cleveland Browns quarterback laid motionless on the field after losing the ball due to a failed snap during the team's regular season match against the Buffalo Bills (shown below, left). That day, Twitter user Robby Kalland[1] posted a photoshopped image of Manziel laying on the ground with several other professional athletes (shown below, right). On November 28th, 2014, a teaser trailer for Star Wars: The Force Awakens was released on the Movieclips Trailers YouTube channel (shown below). In the trailer, a hooded Sith Lord is shown activating a large lightsaber with two more miniature blades emerging from the hilt at a 90 degree angle, resembling the crossguard[9] built on to European swords. On January 11th, 2014, the earliest known example of the meme was posted by the @FunnyPicsDepot[4] Twitter feed, featuring a man pushing his car in order to reach his girlfriend (shown below). In 10 months, the tweet gained over 2,400 retweets and 1,600 favorites. On June 29, 2011, YouTuber JustAnotherCinema uploaded a short clip of the reaction[1] after he had killed an opponent by rotating 360 degrees in mid-air and hurling a knife at KcE II NiNjAZz, an opponent. Since June of 2011, the video has acquired 460,000+ views and 6,000 likes (shown below).  On November 11th, 2014, Paper Magazine's Twitter account shared a link to a brief article showcasing two studio photographs of Kim Kardashian, the 34-year-old TV personality and wife of Kanye West, for the cover image of its latest issue, both captioned with the subtitle "Break the Internet / Kim Kardashian" (shown below). In less than 24 hours, the tweet racked up more than 3,200 retweets and 2,500 favorites. Within the hour, Kim Kardashian also shared one of the cover photos via Instagram, in which she is shown popping a bottle of champagne, with its geyser drawing a perfect arc over her head and being poured into a glass positioned on her buttocks (shown below). Kardashian's Instagram photo garnered more than 462,000 likes and nearly 15,000 comments. The cover photographs were commissioned by renowned French graphic designer and photographer Jean-Paul Goude, who sought to recreate his iconic portrait photograph Carolina Beaumont, New York, 1976 originally featured in his 1982 book Jungle Fever (shown below). "Running in the 90's" first appeared on the compilation album Super Eurobeat Vol. 85 in 1998.[7] After the release, the song received critical acclaim and praise from prominent reviewers. Eurobeat once reviewed (in a now-deleted article) that, "The action and the rush of adrenaline the song delivered was astounding, we haven't seen anything like it." [Work In Progress. Any help is greatly appreciated] The original video was first uploaded to YouTube on 10 March 2013 and, as of December 2014, has gained over 5.1 million views. It has also lead to many Vines parodying the Wealdstone Raider. In August 2006, the animated television series Metalocalypse premiered on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim programming block. Intended to be both a parody and a celebration of heavy metal culture, the series explores larger-than-life stereotypes of metalheads and exaggerated dark humor.[1] The quote in verbatim, "that's brutal," was originally said by Nathan Explosion, the frontman of the fictional band Dethklok. On February 27th, 2008, Urban Dictionary[1] user Adam Mateljan submitted an entry for "lumbersexual," defining it as a "metrosexual" with a "finely trimmed beard." This energetic fleet girl proclaiming herself as "Naka-chan the fleet's idol" is well-known for her unique personality like a typical Japanese idol[2], which nature comes from the similarity between her ship number "48" and Japanese idol group AKB48.[3] On the other hand, she is also known for a dishonorable title "The dismantling idol" (解体のアイドル, Kaitai no idol) which comes from a pun for "The fleet's idol" (艦隊のアイドル, Kantai no idol) as well as a common experience among the game players that they dismantle her with disappointment because her high appearance rate makes her often appear on when they want to get or construct other rare ship girls. The iconic number representing her, "2-4-11", stands for the numbers of resources which can get from her dismantlement (2 fuels, 4 Bullets and 11 Steels). Against a backdrop of this Naka's funny but slightly unhappy circumstances, a parody illustration of she singing an imaginary song named "2-4-11 of Love" at a Karaoke box was drawn for an official fan book for KanColle by an illustrator kinnotama (きんのたま), and it was uploaded to his pages in pixiv[4] and Nico Nico Seiga[5] on September 26th, 2013. The Creation of Adam was painted as one of the nine frescos on the Sistine Chapel ceiling in Vatican City by Michelangelo between 1511 and 1512. The artwork depicts a bearded man, who represents the Biblical Christian God, floating in the air while reaching out to a nude man, who represents the first human Adam in Abrahamic religions (shown below). One of the earliest known parodies of the painting was on a promotional poster for the 1982 science fiction film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, featuring the hand of the alien E.T. touching the finger of the film's protagonist Elliot (shown below). On November 17th, 2014, a preview of the animated music video for Teddyloid's "ME!ME!ME!"[1] was released on the official website of Japan Animator Expo[2], a weekly web series launched and curated in collaboration between the Neon Genesis Evangelion creator Hideaki Anno's Studio Khara and the Japanese media company Dwango in late October 2014 as an outlet to showcase various works by up-and-coming artists, followed by the release of the full-length music video on November 21st. According to the official description, the music video illustrates the story of a young man being "attacked and ravished by many girls". The track was originally composed by Japanese electronic musician Teddyloid with lyrics provided by Daoko; the animated music video for the song was produced as a joint effort between character designer Shuichi Iseki and executive director Hibiki Yoshizaki.  During a National Football League game between the New York Giants and the Dallas Cowboys on November 23rd, 2014, Beckham managed to catch a touchdown pass thrown by quarterback Eli Manning by reaching backwards behind is head with one arm (shown below). After the touchdown pass was made, Twitter user @flexpotvin[1] tweeted an edited picture of the fresco painting "The Creation of Adam" by Michelangelo featuring a cutout image of Beckham mid-catch (shown below). In less than 24 hours, the tweet gained over 2,000 retweets and 1,400 favorites. On June 4th, 2014, the film 22 Jump Street was released as a sequel to the 2012 film 21 Jump Street. In the film, police officers Morton Schmidt (played by Jonah Hill) and Greg Jenko go undercover as hispanic gang members, leading Jenko to introduce himself as "Jeff" (shown below).  On June 21st, 2014, Viner Peaches Monroee uploaded a video in which she speaks to the camera while sitting in a car and announces that her eyebrows are "on fleek" (shown below). In the first five months, the video gained over 20 million plays, 492,000 likes and 411,000 revines. "We in this bitch. Finna get crunk. Eyebrows on fleek. Da fuq." During a 2002 episode of the WWE, professional wrestler and model Stacy Keibler entered the ring and danced on the table in front of McMahon while he watched in amazement during the performance (shown below). Following the dance, McMahon hired Keibler as his personal assistant. On November 1st, 2013, YouTuber wazeu2 uploaded a video titled "Funny Vince McMahon looking at a bodybuilder, which featured footage of bodybuilder Gary Strydom[5] flexing during a World Bodybuilding Federation competition spliced between footage of McMahon reacting to Keibler (mirror below). The earliest known use of the hashtag on Twitter can be attributed to Jessie Livesay[7], a mother of three and a high school teacher in Dayton, Ohio, who tweeted a message expressing her disapproval of the "new healthy food laws" on August 30th, 2011. The first notable wave of #ThanksMichelleObama tweets took place in April 2014, though it didn't gain much traction until months later, on November 13th, when Hunter Whitney, a student at Richland Center High School in Richland Center, Wisconsin, tweeted a photograph of a school lunch meal consisting of Spanish rice and an apple with the hashtag #ThanksMichelleObama (shown below): The game KanColle displays illustrations of injured fleet girls when they suffer "small," "massive" and "moderate" damage during the battles. The "moderate" damage illustration for the character Myoukou was often considered humorous for its sexually suggestive pose. The exact origin of "bae" is unknown. On March 14th, 2003, Urban Dictionary[1] user Trong submitted an entry for "bae," defining it as a "bastardization of the term 'babe'." On November 17th, 2014, American author and blogger Pamie Ribon ran a blog post titled “Barbie Fucks It Up Again,”[1] in which she asserted that Barbie: I Can Be a Computer Engineer,[6] a children's book written by Susan Marenco and published in 2013 as a companion to Mattel's "Computer Engineer Barbie" doll introduced in 2010, actually promotes gender stereotypes about women and technology. In the story, Barbie sets out to develop a game for her computer class project, but after accidentally infecting her computer with a virus, she enlists the assistance of two boys to fix her computer and code the video game that she had envisioned. At the end, she still takes credit for developing the game and says "I guess I can be a computer engineer!" The multi-panel image series on Twitter began to take off in late September 2014[1], when @ItsLadinaPlis tweeted a photoset consisting of three images showing a top knot bun hairstyle, oversized golden hoop rings and a madonna-style piercing. On December 17th, 2009, the conservative political blog Authentic Connecticut Republican[1] published a post highlighting a demotivational poster of a young girl making a "middle finger" gesture with the caption "Thanks, Obama" (shown below). The phrase *hits blunt* first began surfacing on Twitter in mid-September 2014, with the earliest known viral instance posted by Twitter User @JimJones[1] on September 16th. Over the course of the next two months, the tweet garnered more than 4,400 retweets and 3,200 favorites (shown below): On the same date of September 16th, hip hop entertainment and news magazine Complex[2] picked up on the latest trend on Twitter, which showcased a small collection of tweets posted from earlier that day and likened the meme to the philosophical musings often shared by Will Smith's son and child actor Jaden Smith. Male pregnancy has been used as a theme in various works of fiction, including the 1978 comedy film Rabbit Test, the BBC science fiction sitcom Red Dwarf and the 1994 comedy film Junior (shown below). On October 29th, 2003, Urban Dictionary[4] user Boochies submitted an entry for "mpreg," defining it as a "story where a man becomes pregnant." On October 8th, 2007, YouTuber djvensterke2 uploaded a video titled "Wally," in which Eddy Wally appears in front of a blue screen, says "Wow!" and winks before exiting the frame (shown below). In the next seven years, the video gained over 261,500 views and 300 comments. Whilst the general format of the text can be attributed to the Ultimate Kyurem Black text that is first seen on May 2, 2014, the first text that mentions Charizard as the base character was the charizard xy paste. Then around July, the character's name progressively changed to Chardogon. The exact purpose of the text is unknown, but possibly to satirize the elitism and fanboyism surrounding Charizard or the low quality of original characters in general. scottrosenfeld of DeviantART claims to be the original writer of the pasta and has been continually writing the series since last summer. The thread where he claims to be one can be seen here. A fleet girl in the sixth destroyer corps, Inazuma, is one of the most popular characters among KanColle players because she is one of the 5 selectable fleet girls at start-up and most of the players choose her for the missions which require her. So, her pure-hearted but very timid personality and her characteristic suffix "Nanodesu" (なのです) are familiar to all of the players. Meanwhile, the concept of this character was ignited by an illustration in which a chibi Inazuma with black circle eyes is slamming both hands against the table powerfully along with the remark that can be read "I Hate Eggplants" (ナスは嫌゛い゛な゛の゛て゛す！！, Nasu wa KIRAI NANODESU!!). This illustration was posted to Twitter by user ‏@suki_suke (すき)[2] on August 21st, 2013[3], and it was drawn simply for a joke reply to his friend @Nasu_e (ナス).[4] On November 15th, 2014, the American cable channel Lifetime premiered Aaliyah: The Princess of R&B, a direct-to-TV film detailing the R&B singer's rise to fame and her ill-fated life, starring actress Alexandra Shipp as the titular recording artist. That evening, Twitter[13] user Akata Gunde tweeted a photograph of rapper Iggy Azalea with the caption "#LifetimeBeLike Just casted Mariah Carey" (shown below). This character was born from an illustration posted to pixiv by user Jugem-T[2] on October 5th, 2013.[3] According to the descriptions of the post, his illustration titled "The 1st Battleship of the Kongō-Class from Jamaica" was inspired by a description in a popular Kancolle doujin book "Haruna[4] has so white skin". He construed that it means the rest of the Kongō-class sisters are not fair skin, but are dark skin. And he had a flash of inspiration of this dark-skinned Kongō-class fleet "guy". Additionally, the creator also explained his characteristics in the descriptions: On November 18th, 2014, IGN published its review of Pokemon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire for Nintendo 3DS by IGN, which praised the title's gorgeous CG details and post-game easter eggs, while listing the overabundance of HMs (hidden machines) and water as its cons. The game received a rating of 7.8 out of 10. Given the geographical setting of Omega Ruby and Sapphire in Hoenn, a fictional region consisting of many islands and waterways, the review's commentary on there being "too much water" instantly became a point of contention among the IGN members and fans of the game at large.  On May 16th, 2012, BuzzFeed[5] published a compilation of pop culture nostalgia images titled "48 Things That Will Make You Feel Old," which included a photograph of rapper Eminem's daughter Hailie Mathers with the caption "Feel Old Yet?" (shown below).  In Season 5, Episode 9 of NBC sitcom series The Office, originally aired on November 20th, 2008, Michael Scott (portrayed by Steve Carrel) is shown minding his own business as he walks around the office, shortly before running into Toby Flenderson (portrayed by Paul Lieberstein), the branch's human resources (HR) representative and Michael Scott's least favorite co-worker who had just returned from a lengthy vacation in Costa Rica. Upon seeing him, Michael Scott compulsively yells "NO" in utter shock and dismay. On December 27th, 2008, the earliest known clip of the scene was uploaded by YouTuber PeterPro, which has garnered more than 9.9 million views and 62,000 likes as of mid-November 2014. On August 13th, 2013, YouTuber lNicrolax v.2 uploaded a high-definition version of the same clip, gaining over 160,000 views in just over a year (shown below).  On November 8th, 2014, the Video Productions YouTube channel uploaded a hidden-camera style video titled “Drunk Girl in Public (Social Experiment)”, which shows a woman getting approached by several men while looking heavily intoxicated on Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles (shown below). In the first week, the video gained over 9.19 million views.  Illustrated by American painter Weimer Pursell, the original poster was commissioned and distributed by the U.S. Government Printing Office for the Office of Price Administration in 1943 as part of domestic efforts to encourage rationing and conservation of resources. The image depicts a suited man driving a car with a phantom-like silhouette of Adolf Hitler in the passenger seat, captioned with “When you ride alone you ride with Hitler! / Join a car-sharing club today!” (shown below). Gardevoir, whose name is derived from a combination of the French words Garde ('guard') and voir ('see'), made its debut appearance as the 282nd official character in Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire versions of Nintendo's video game series, which were released in Japan on November 21st, 2002 and elsewhere overseas between March and July 2003. In the end of 2008, the 90's Japanese TVCMs for Battle Dome became to a popular visual resource for MAD videos on NND, and Nico Nico Pedia's article for the toy was made in November of that year.[1] The gijinka character for the toy was suddenly born in the comment board for the article which has Oekaki[2] applet. The first illustration was posted to there by an anonymous user on May 3rd, 2009.[3]  The marble-based game Battle Dome was originally created by the American toy company Anjar Co. in 1994 and was later licensed to many international companies, including the Japanese-based Tsukuda Original.[2] With Tsukuda Original, they began airing a series of adverts on Japanese stations to promote the game during October 1994. These commercials later began resurfacing online over a decade later, with the earliest being uploaded to YouTube by user igasinob on June 21st, 2008.  On October 14th, 2014, Random House published Brand’s political commentary book Revolution[1], which advocates a social revolution to bring about an end to "corporate tyranny, ecological irresponsibility and economic inequality." On November 2nd, British marketing consultant Dan Barker[2] posted a quote from the book, noting that it reminded him of actor Phil Daniels’ narration from Blur's 1994 hit single “Parklife” (shown below). In the first 48 hours, the tweet gained over 8,100 retweets and 5,700 favorites.  On November 10th, 2014, Redditor throwfarfarawayaz submitted a story titled "WTF is going on in Pinal county, Arizona??" to the /r/nosleep[4] subreddit, which described a horrific disease that killed a number of children in Mammoth, Arizona and hinted at a possible zombie outbreak. In the first 28 hours, the post gained over 3,500 votes (91% upvoted). I am going to begin this by saying that I chose this online community because it has the exposure of over 1.4 million people. If anyone reading this is in (or knows someone in) Mammoth, Arizona please contact me immediately via this reddit username. I also posted this on my website (I run a blog about cold cases) but for some reason I can't see it. I've tried posting it at least 15 times but I'm not getting anywhere. So I really hope this post uploads. I live in Mammoth, Arizona and nothing has ever happened here worth writing about because, well, Mammoth has a population of around 1,500. Eleven days ago, on the 3rd, an older woman who runs a home daycare in my town was found dead in her bathroom by a parent who was picking up his daughter. The kids were all really agitated and told police that Mrs. Booker (the deceased) had been yelling at them and bleeding from her eye before she went into the bathroom and collapsed in her bathtub. Sad, and unpleasant, but not really news. But a day later one of the daycare babies developed a rash and started bleeding from her ear. She died 12 hours later and so did EIGHT other kids from that daycare – all with similar symptoms. This started a shitstorm in my town. In a town of 1,500 people, attempts the keep people unaware and calm were an utter failure. It was on facebook by the following day. Nine people who had been at the hospital when the kids were starting to trickle in also started exhibiting these symptoms, I'm told. None lasted more than a few days. By last Friday, 18 people who had indirect contact with the children were reported missing or dead of natural or unknown causes – all had exhibited similar symptoms just before their deaths. It was at this point that I became directly affected. My sister returned from Oro Valley (the closest hospital) a complete wreck. She had gone to visit her friend's new baby and upon arriving had been informed that both her friend and her baby had died. Everything I just told you was told to her by a frightened nurse. I fact checked what I could. My sister was literally hysterical. She was speaking a full octave higher than usual and at twice the speed – I have never seen her act like that before. Her shoulders and arms had bruises so big I thought maybe she'd been in a car accident on the way home. She told me she didn't know where she'd gotten them and when I tried to put her to bed she freaked out and started screaming at me that my bedroom was too hot. I took her temperature which was 102.8. I convinced her to go to bed. I fell asleep on the couch shortly after waiting for a call back from our town's M.E. I woke up to my phone going off – I had 7 texts from friends of mine all reporting the same thing: Entire families were being found beaten to death all over Mammoth. Blood, bruises, nails and teeth missing, hair ripped out- all of them. I heard reports of anywhere from 14 to 55 dead bodies, depending on who you were talking to. In a state of completely shock, I did the only thing I could do really well on autopilot – I wrote an article about it for my blog. I made some calls around the city but my usual contacts weren't picking up. I went to check on my sister and she was bleeding from her ear – heavily. Between that and the bruising, I started to wonder if these were actually home invasions at all. I called the 24 hour urgent care in town but no one picked up. I didn't want to risk driving her back to Oro Valley. I then tried 911, which also rang endlessly. I called my friend in Oro who works for a legit newsagent and she told me that they were reporting NW Medical was running a skeleton crew because most of the medical staff had either called in sick or been found dead in their homes. She said she'd seen tanks in Oro. I woke up the next morning and my sister was gone. I don't know where she is and I'm too scared to go looking for her. I have called the CDC multiple times but every time I call the same woman answers. The first time she took a statement and said she'd get back to me. Every subsequent time I've called, she immediately puts me on hold. She never comes back to the line. This morning my contact at the police department finally called me back. He told me the death toll is "incalculable" at this point and that they are being "iced out" by both the state and federal governments at this point with one exception. Two people from the CDC showed up yesterday. My contact overheard them talking about Mrs. Booker's cancer treatments as if it were relevant… He doesn't know if it is but he hopes I can make something out of it. I can't. I don't know about Oro, but my estimation for Mammoth itself is around 40 dead after showing the same symptoms. I haven't seen any of this in the news, which I've been watching religiously. Why not? We have been told the safest place for us right now is inside our homes. I haven't seen a car pass down my street in two days. I'm scared. My sister is still missing but I'm too afraid to look for her or go into the room she was sleeping in. My hair is falling out from stress. I've been smoking like crazy. This morning I noticed a bruise on my arm. I know my immune system is compromised and I'm too afraid to leave my house. I called my parents in Tucson and left a message but they haven't called back. The last I heard from my friend in Oro was Saturday morning. She texted to tell me they had started to find bodies lying in the street. No one is bothering to collect them anymore. I responded but she never texted back. I'll update more as soon as I can. Anyone in Oro or Mammoth, please contact me. I haven't seen another human in over two days and I feel like the last person on earth. Edit: it's almost 6 here and a siren has been going off for about ten minutes. I don't know if it's a tornado siren or an air raid siren but it's loud and creepy as fuck. I noticed a small bruise on my arm that upon further fucking inspection spreads all the way down one side of my back. I'm so fucking scared. I had a breakdown where I just screamed at the wall and cried and there was blood in my tears and that was like an hour ago. To the person calling businesses here: that is not us answering. Our downtown has been shut down all day. I called a couple places where I know the business owners and employees and the people who answered are not locals. I don't know what they told you but they're not from here. I'm going to go over to the neighbors becAuse I can't be alone anymore and fuck it, it's not like I can get it because I've already got it. The sirens have me terrified and the sun is almost down here. My name is Lindsey Allen, I'm 29 and I'm from Mammoth, AZ The video was created by Casper Kelly, an Adult Swim producer who works on the network’s show “Your Pretty Face Is Going to Hell”. He pitched the idea to current Squidbillies writer-producer Jim Fortier, who then sent it to Adult Swim executive Mike Lazzo, who loved the idea. Kelly shot the original footage in the course of 72 hours in late October 2013, the entire cast being composed of extras from the Atlanta area. According to extra Katie Adkins, the cast were not presented with a clearly explained script, but rather coached on the go, in a somewhat nonchalant manner.[23] Over the following year, Kelly worked on editing the video, with some help from friends and co-workers. The final cut eventually premiered at 4 a.m. (EST) on October 31st, 2014 as part of Adult Swim’s “Infomercials” series. A week later, on November 7th, the clip was uploaded to the network’s official YouTube channel, garnering over 320,000 views and 7,000 likes within the first 24 hours. It currently holds over 8,000,000 views, making it the 2nd most watched video on the Adult Swim YouTube channel.   Kichiku Megane released its limited edition on July 20th, 2007, and the standard edition was released in October of that year. Prior to the release, its opening title movie was published at the official page on May 17th as part of a promoting campaign, and it was quickly reuploaded to YouTube and NND.[4] This video is made in a typical adult video games credit movie format which introduces each characters by still-illustrations only. The opening theme song "under the darkness" is composed and sung by C.G mix[5], one of the main composers in the Japanese music production I've sound. This opening song is also popular on NND partly due to its many funny misheard phrases coming from the singer's poor pronunciation. The 1st TV anime series Durarara!! was aired from January to June in 2010 which was produced by the same staffs of the TV anime adaptation for the author's another title Baccano!. And, both of its 1st (shown below, left) and 2nd (shown below, right) opening credit movies are made in the same way to that of Baccano! which also caused a parody video remix fad on NND in before. Hence, it resemble the opening title of 2000 American film Snatch directed by Guy Ritchie as well. The 1st opening theme song "Uragiri no Yūyake" (裏切りの夕焼け; lit. "Sunset of Betrayal") is sung by Japanese funk rock band Theatre Brook[1], and the 2nd one "Complication" (コンプリケイション) is the debut single of Japanese band ROOKiEZ is PUNK'D.[2] The TV anime series for ef was produced by Japanese anime studio Shaft. Its 1st seasn ef – a tale of memories. and 2nd season ef – a tale of melodies. were aired in the fall season of 2007 and 2008 in each. The opening movies are known for its impressive rendition that slightly change its visuals and the song's lyrics along with the stories progress. Each season's opening theme song "euphoric field" and "ebullient future" is sung by Japanese pop singer Elisa[2] in both English and Japanese. The TV anime series for Kannazuki no Miko aired 12 episodes between October and December of 2004, and it was also aired on North America as Destiny of the Shrine Maiden in 2010. Its ending movie is consisting of only one still-illustration depicting 2 main characters' embrace. The ending theme song "Agony" was sung by Japanese singer Kotoko.[3] The TV anime series BLOOD+ was aired from October 2005 until September 2006, and it has 4 different ending credit movies. Among them, almost all of parody videos in this series refer to the 1st ending credit movie consisting of still-illustrations only. It was used until the first 15 episodes and its theme song "Kataritsugu Koto" (語り継ぐこと; lit. "The Things I Pass Down") is sung by a Japanese singer Chitose Hajime.[2]  The TV anime series Higurashi When They Cry Kai (ひぐらしのなく頃に解, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai) aired 24 episodes between July and December of 2007. Its theme song "Naraku no Hana" (奈落の花; lit. "Flower of Hell")[1] is sung by a Japanese pop singer Eiko Shimamiya.[2] The TV anime series for the manga aired 12 episodes between April and June of 2006. Its ending movie is mainly consisting of still-illustrations of girls cute and funny facial expressions and their unsophisticated dancing. The ending theme song "incl." was sung by a Japanese singer Megumi Hinata, better known as her alias meg rock.[2] The exact origin of the emoticon is unknown. But the earliest archive and explanation of it goes back to 1997. The broken nose emoticon was compiled along within the other various emoticons by James Marshall from The University of Maryland : The Department of Astronomy.[7] The original webpage does not exist today, but fortunately it has been achieved on the webside Internet Wayback Machine in 11 December 1997. The article defines the emoticon as seen below. The definition of the emoticon is also submitted to Urban Dictionary[1] by user "-" on October 22nd, 2008, defining it as "An emoticon describing the feeling of being happy and having a nose." The Landmaster tanks are vehicles originally appearing in Star Fox 64 (also known as Lylat Wars in PAL regions), where they are used by the Star Fox team in order to complete their objectives on planets Titania and Macbeth. The tanks possess many abilities such as rolling over (also known as barrel rolling) and temporarily hovering. The Landmaster tanks also make an appearance in Star Fox: Assault, getting a slight redesign for this game. In Super Smash Bros. Brawl, it fuctions as the Final Smash of Fox, Falco and Wolf. While all three characters control the same basic vehicle, each model has its own modified attributes. The Landmaster is a large and powerful machine, which is capable of delivering multiple KOs and also grants invisibility to the user. Despite this, the fact that the tanks are heavy and kind of unwieldy makes it easy for the player to be self-destructed accidentaly. In Super Smash Bros. Wii U and 3DS, the Landmaster returns as the Final Smash of Fox and Falco once again, without many notable differences from the previous installment of the series. As of 2014, TV anime series of Rozen Maiden have aired 4 seasons in total. Among them, the subject for parody videos is mainly the ending credit movie in the 3rd season Rozen Maiden: Ouvertüre which aired 2 episodes in December 22nd and 23rd, 2006. The song "Ustusemi no Kage" (空蝉の影, lit. "This world's shadow") was sung by a Japanese band Kukui.[1] Lu Bu is an extremely powerful character from Dynasty Warriors and usually takes 20 minutes of button-mashing to take down, does not flinch when attacked and usually kills you in 3-4 hits. The "It's Lu Bu, do not pursue" joke originated from the a cutscene in the Hu Lao Gate map in Dynasty Warriors. During the cutscene, Lu Bu appears in a grand manor after which a soldier would say 'It's Lu Bu!' in the background. After the cutscene, you will be given a warning saying 'Do not pursue Lu Bu'. Can someone with a bit more experience help me with this? Leave a comment if you want to help. The idea for a blogger's code of conduct was first proposed by Tim O'Reilly in March 2007, shortly after programmer and game developer Kathy Sierra cancelled her appearance at the O'Reilly ETech Conference due to hostile messages and online harassments she has had received, including death threats and doxxing of her personally identifiable information by hacker Andrew Auernheimer. Throughout March 2007, Sierra's encounter with cyberbullying sparked a broader discussion in the news media and bloggers' community about online harassments in general, which culminated with Tim O'Reilly calling for a guideline of online behaviors in a BBC article[1] published on March 28th. The phrase "powerhouse of the cell" used to describe the function of mitochondria was coined by biologist Philip Siekevitz in the article "Powerhouse of the Cell" published in 1957. In April, 2013, Tumblr[1] user apatheticghost posted several things learned in school, which included "mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell" (shown below). In the following two years, the post gained over 992,000 notes. On October 31st, 2013, Redditor Musicmantobes submitted a photoshopped picture of a bird with the head of the "Doge" Shibu Inu to the /r/SuperShibe[6] subreddit (shown below).  Upon its box office release January 16th, 2009, Paul Blart: Mall Cop[1] was heavily panned by critics, receiving a rating of 33% on Rotten Tomatoes[2] and an overall score of 5.2 on IMDB.[3] On April 17th, 2015, its sequel Paul Blart:Mall Cop 2[7] was released, this time directed by Andy Fickman,[6] which was regarded by critics as an even more of a failure than the original film, with an overall score of 3.9 on IMDB[4] and a 14/100 rating by the users on Metacritic.[5] Despite their negative critical reception, both films performed relatively well in the box office. On the Internet, the original film drew a substantial ironic fanbase similar to the fandoms surrounding Johnny Test and Cory In The House with the emergence of anagrammed posters for the movie on 4chan[11] and Tumblr[20], shortly after the announcement of the sequel production in 2014. The phrase “blowout”[3] was initially used in the context of competitive sporting events to describe an outcome of a match in which one team or individual has outscored the opponent by a wide margin. The earliest known use of the phrase online in this context can be found in blog post on the Blogger blog Rhymescheme,[4] published on October 15th, 2001 in reference to a Filipino basketball team’s 50-point loss. On November 2nd, Twitter user @auscalum[1] tweeted a picture of a Target employee wearing the name tag "Alex" and bagging items behind the cashier.

On October 14th, 2014, the "Bye Felipe" Instagram[1] feed was launched by Los Angeles resident Alexandra Tweten, with the first post featuring an aggressive message from a man asking to chat on an online dating service (shown below).  According to Encyclopedia Dramatica,[6] an anonymous 4chan user posted the "Dead Can Man" creepypasta to the /b/ (random) board on December 11th, 2010, which described a dead body discovered by a group of friends in a condemned house. Along with the story, the poster included several photographs of an abandoned building, a day planner and a decomposing human body seated in a chair. According to the image EXIF data, the photographs were taken with a Nikon D40 on April 9th, 2009, matching up with the original poster's story.[1] This story is 100% true. Believe me or not, it happened. This is the first time I’ve posted the full story and all the pictures. It was April or May of 2009. My friend (let’s call him Vinnie) was in from out of town and we decided to drink at about noon. We went to a party store and bought some 40s and just walked around town brown bagging it. We got a call from another friend (Justin) that he and his girlfriend (Kim) were going to drop by. By now it was the early afternoon, and we made it back to my place. I had mentioned to Vinnie that the house next door was condemned; it had a bright pink sign on the front door with CONDEMNED written on it because the garage behind the house was collapsing. I had never seen anyone in or out of that house in the two years I had been living next door to it. I had just assumed it was abounded or got foreclosed upon (we have a lot of foreclosures in Michigan, yes, this is in Michigan). As kids, we’d always love exploring the woods, and looking for random things. It only seemed fitting that we go into the house and have a look around. We were pretty drunk at this point, and just thought, fuck it lets do this. We went in behind the house, through the partially collapsing garage. The door that went from the garage to the house was locked, but after a while we were able to force it open. To our immediate right was the basement, so we decided to go down there first. We were amazed by the amount of stuff down there; there were so many tools and hardware supplies. In the back of the basement, in its own room, was a large train track set up. It was creepy. While we were in the basement, we got a call from Justin and Kim that they had arrived at my house. We came back out the house through the garage again and I grabbed my Nikon. Kim and Justin were pretty pumped about going in and what we discovered, so we went back in and showed them the basement. After looking around, we went back upstairs to the kitchen. Again, there was a lot of stuff in there. A table by in the corner of the room was full of bottles and cans, which we planned on taking after looking around the rest of the house (there is a ten cent deposit for cans in Michigan). We took some time poking around the kitchen. It of course smelled bad in there, but it wasn’t overwhelming. The smell was just that of a musty house. I made the mistake of looking in the refrigerator, and the smell of THAT overwhelmed me from the rotting food that’s smell was being contained until I opened it. There was a door that separated the kitchen from the living room, and I was the first to open it. It was a swinging door, and when I opened it I caught a glance of a figure sitting in a chair facing away from me. All I knew is that someone was in the house and we were trespassing. I quickly turned around and while walking towards the back door I told my friends in a whisper, “shit there is somebody here,” and we all ran out. We went back into my backyard, and I had told them that I saw somebody sitting in a chair in the living room. My friend Vinnie, who was most likely more drunk than I was, said, “Fuck it man, he has no more of a right to be there than us. It is probably a junkie.” I was not as excited to go back in to confront a squatting junkie, but I was convinced when Justin informed me that he was most likely high as fuck and wouldn’t be able to do shit (Justin had been addicted to heroin for a few years at that point to I trusted his judgment of the situation. He’s clean now). We ended up going back in through the back again, but more quietly this time. When we made it to the kitchen, Vinnie was the first to open the door this time to the living room. The rest of us stood back and just watched him watch the figure in the chair. Vinnie swung the door shut, looked at us, and said, “That’s a dead body.” We all looked at him in shock, as it was obvious that he was serious. We all trickled into the living room and gathered around the body. His skin was black (even though we found out later he was white), and was sitting in a chair facing the front of house. It was obvious that he had been there for a while. The smell near the body was almost unbearable; we needed to cover our mouths and noses with our shirts like respirators. This made Vinnie and I sober up really quickly. There was a complete silence between our group of four while we observed the body. Nobody said a word. I can’t really tell you what happened next, as it gets kind of foggy from there. The effect of seeing a dead body is a kind of surreal experience. We looked around the rest of the house, upstairs and in other rooms on the ground floor, and eventually found a journal next the body. We flipped through the journal, and, every day he listed what he ate, the temperature, and how much money he made in returning cans that day (which I found strange because there was at least $50 worth of cans sitting in the house). I took some more pictures of the house and of the body (although at the time Vinnie was very opposed to doing this) and we left to go the bar. At some point Kim left and it was just us three, but I remember her taking in the experience quite well, and was not as disturbed by it as much as other girls (some people don’t even want to hear the story let alone see the pictures). We went the bar that night, sat in the back, and just quietly talked about what had happened. After the bar, drunk again, Justin and I went back in the house to check it out one more time. I took some more pictures, and Vinnie and Justin left for the night. I told my roommates about it, and one of them told his girlfriend. She was so disturbed she said she refused to come over until the body was gone. She said if I didn’t call the cops than she would. The next morning, hung over, I decided that I better call the police. I called my friends to let them know and they made me hold off on doing it until they came over. I waited and called an anonymous tip line when they arrived. When I called the tip line, I simply said that I found a dead body. The operator seemed frazzled and told me to hold the line. She told me multiple times not to hang up. I held the line, and we put on with a detective for our city. I explained what happened, and what the address was. He asked me my name, but I told him he had to be fucking insane if he thought I would be giving my name to him. Right after hanging up we all went to the front porch to wait for the cops to come. Not even a full minute after hanging up the phone, I saw a cop car round the corner with its lights on. We were really surprised by the response time, but it ended up driving by the house. A few minutes later a few cop cars rolled up and asked us if we had seen anyone in our out of the house lately. I told him that I saw nobody near the house in the last two years I had been living there. The police went in for a while, and a white van showed up. Eventually some girls that lived across the street come over wondering what was going on. The police said they found a body, and we of course acted shocked. They took out the body covered on a stretcher (they must have had a hell of a time prying him from the chair) and also took out a gun that was in the house (the gun was an old style rifle that had been leaning against a wall in the living room). I talked to one of the cops and he said that the guy’s family would have them check up on the guy from time to time to make sure he was doing alight (apparently he wanted nothing to do with the family) but they stopped doing so. He just wanted to be left alone. The only think that we took from the house was the journal he kept. There is a bunch of nice handwriting in it, and it with addresses and such. The first entry was on January 21st stating that the notebook was found in a dumpster. There is also an entry talking about when the power was turned out, and notes to buy oil (there were a bunch of oil burning lamps in the house). The last entry in the journal, May 3rd, says, “Sick- very flu 4 cans. Sick as heck flu can’t eat”. It is eerie. The date matched up with the most current newspaper he had in a pile in the living room. We decided not to take anything out of respect for him and the family. I know that certain things were worth a lot of money, but I’m not about to be the type of person that loots a dead guy’s house. I figured that the family would come and get the stuff, but they never did. The house ended up being sold, and I saw the people who bought it bring out boxes filled with sheet music, toy trains, etc. The house has since been fixed up and it’s being rented out. I could find no information on either the house or the guy who died even over a year later. I am posting this just to share my experience. This happened in 2009 but I am just now deciding to share it with everyone. I am not trying to make jokes or act like it is a funny story. This guy died alone in his house and was found by strangers over a year after his death. Make jokes if you want, but this guy was alone, and obviously had some problems.

"A potato flew around before you came excuse the…" The phrase was first used by Kathy Sierra, an American developer known for educating Javascript-based technologies and authoring a series of training manuals for programmers, in an article she posted to her Wordpress blog on August 10th, 2005. Titled "Physics of Passion: The Koolaid Point," the article postulated that during the rapid growth phase of an up-and-coming brand, there is a threshold point at which the consumer opinions about the said brand takes a negative turn largely due to its overwhelming commercial success. The concept, which stems from the well-known American-English colloquialism "drinking the Kool-Aid,"[10] can be seen as a parallel theory to another sociological concept known as the Tipping Point[10], which refers to the threshold at which the public at large widely adopts a previously little-known practice over a drastically short period of time. It is physically impossible to have everyone love what you do. And the more people do love it, the more likely it is that you'll have an equal and opposite negative reaction.

Due to the popularity of the film in conspiracy theory circles, the terms 'blue pill' and 'red pill' became widespread. 'Greenpill' was created as an alternative. The first instance of the Greenpill character designs comes from a 4chan comic portraying stereotypes of different college students[6]. A 4chan user later re-tweaked the characters into becoming the modern pill characters.

One of the images featured the eyeless creature (shown above). On February 25th, 2012, Creepypasta[3] Wiki user Azelf5000 posted a story based on the creature in the image titled "Eyeless Jack," which was written from the perspective of a man named Mitch who encountered an eyeless creature. Hello, my name is Mitch. I'm here to tell you guys about an experience I had. I don't know if it was paranormal or whatever stupid words people use to describe supernatural phenomena, but after that thing visited me, I believe in that paranormal trash, now. A week after I moved in with my brother, Edwin, after my house was foreclosed, I finished unpacking. Edwin liked the idea of me moving in, since we had not seen each other after 10 years, so I was excited, too. I soon fell asleep after I moved in. After that 1 week, I heard rustling noises coming from outside at about one in the morning. I thought it was a raccoon, so I ignored and tried to fall asleep. The next morning, I told Edwin about it, and he agreed. The next night, however, I thought I heard my window opening and a loud thump, as if something entered my room. I darted up and looked around my room, but I saw nothing. The next morning, Edwin dropped his coffee cup when he saw me. He held up a nearby mirror and I saw myself. I had a large gash in my left cheek. After I was rushed to the hospital, my doctor told me that I must have been sleepwalking, but then he showed me something that made my blood turn cold. He lifted up my shirt to reveal a sewn up incision where my kidneys were. I started in his eyes, my eyes widening. "You somehow lost your left kidney last night. We don't know how, though. Sorry, Mitch." my doctor told me. The next night was my breaking point. Around midnight, I woke up to see a truly horrifying sight. I was staring face to face with a creature with a black hoodie and dark blue mask with no nose or mouth staring down at me. The thing that scared me the most was that it had no eyes. Just empty, black sockets. The creature also had some black substance dripping from it's sockets. I grabbed the camera nearby on a mantel and took a picture. After the picture took, the creature lunged at me and tried to claw open my chest to get to my lungs. I stopped it by kicking it in the face. As I ran out of my room, I grabbed my wallet. I would need the money. I ran out of my brother's house into the night. I eventually ended up in the woods near Edwin's house and tripped on a rock. I fell unconscious and woke up in the hospital. My doctor entered the room. The same one who treated me before. "I have good news and bad news, Mitch." my doctor started. "The good news is that you had minor injuries, and your parents are going to pick you up." I sighed with relief. "The bad news is that your brother has been killed by some… thing. Sorry." My parents took me back to Edwin's house to collect my remaining belongings, which I did. Upon entering my room, I was scared, but remained calm. I grabbed my camera then stopped dead in my tracks. In the hallway leading to my room, I saw Edwin's body and something small lying next to it. I picked up the small thing and entered my parent's car, not mentioning Edwin's corpse. I looked at the thing I had picked up and nearly vomited. I was holding my stolen half-eaten kidney, with some black substance on it.

According to archived discussions[1][2] from the Japanese imageboard site Futaba Channel (2chan), the photoshop meme originally began as a minor fad sometime in the summer of 2014, but it didn't take off until the blank template image was posted on Twitter[4] by @Gorxxx_[3] on October 15th, 2014. On July 27th, 2011, YouTuber Orpheusftw[1] uploaded a video titled “YTPeen: The Misadventures of Skooks – Part 1/5" using sampled footage from Scooby-Doo. As of October 2014, the video has gained over 420,000 views. "My Heart Will Go On" was originally composed by Horner as an instrumental motif which was employed in several scenes in Titanic.[1] Horner and Jennings then wrote lyrics to the song; it was presented to Dion, who was reluctant to sing the song but eventually agreed, and Cameron, who was reluctant to include the song in the film as he found it "too commercial," but eventually agreed as he thought a pop song to help promote the film would calm studio executives who were worried about recuperating the film's high budget. The song was released as a single on Dion's album Let's Talk About Love on December 8th, 1997. Bekasi is a city located east of Jakarta (and also part of the Greater Jakarta Metropolitan Area) that's infamous for its poor infrastructure, broken roads, and its sweltering summer heat in the months of August and October. The earliest instances of the joke can be traced back to October 5th 2014 when Twitter users began complaining on how hot the weather is (Shown Below) @BhanniSKA says: "Hell has broken loose in Bekasi, the sun and dust are very hot" @Geraldvalentino says: "One word [to Bekasi]: HOT!!!" @Puspaacin says: "Bekasi sure is hot."  Gender swapping originated through male players in online gaming communities such as virtual Multi-User Dungeons (MUDs) posing as female players in order for other male players to favor them. Such prevalence of gender swapped deception in MUDs was first noted in 1993 by American sociologist Amy Bruckman in her research paper "Gender Swapping on the Internet": On October 19th, 2014, Redditor Frohoss posted a photograph of his Cane Corso dog looking through a window to the /r/pics[1] subreddit (shown below, left). In the comment section, Redditor AUX1_Dub noted that the dog appears to resemble a sullen detective character from a work of the gritty crime thriller / drama subgenre. That day, Redditor chilirelleno submitted a captioned version of the image titled "Noir Dog" to the /r/AdviceAnimals[2] subreddit, depicting the dog as a film noir detective complaining about a cat (shown below, right). In 24 hours, the posts gained over 4,100 votes (94% upvoted) and 3,900 votes (95% upvoted) respectively.

The battle with pitou ended in the 307th chapter. However, the readers had to wait over a year to know whatever becomes of after the battle where Gon paid a great cost for win because this manga's serialization suspended between the following month and August, 2011. The adult video game was released by a Japanese game developper Parasol[2] on May 25th, 2012. And prior to the game release, its opening movies was published on the several adult game web pages for promotion on April 20th, 2012. On October 15th, 2014, the Drunk J.

On May 11th, 2013, Real Madrid of Spanish Primera League and Juventus of Italian Serie A butted heads in their group-stage match at the UEFA Champions League tournament. With only a few minutes remaining in the first half, Juventus' Chilean midfielder Arturo Vidal was granted a penalty kick opportunity after he was seen suddenly falling over to the ground in mid-dribble. Vidal's penalty-earning fall quickly became a talking point of the match as some fans suspected that the Juventus player deliberately dove without any interference from the defense. In the replay footage, however, Vidal is shown tripping over the ball as a result of a misaimed kick at the ground (shown below). The game ended in a tie after Real Madrid caught up with two equalizers (2 – 2). Over a year later, on October 12th, 2014, Viner Wrestling LAD uploaded a parody version of Vidal's fall with an animated cutout of Orton rushing towards the Juventus player and executing his signature "RKO" cutter move (shown below). Within 48 hours of upload, the video gained over 1,300 revines and 1,200 likes. The TV anime series for Baccano! aired 13th episodes from July to November 2007 at a Japanese satellite broadcasting station WOWOW.

"FOMO" was coined by marketing strategist Dan Herman in a paper titled "FOMO, the ailment of our cultural movement" published in the Journal of Brand Management in 2000.[5] The phrase originates from the game Shin Megami Tensei Persona 4 [1]. It is said by most of the main bosses in the game, which are known as shadows[2], repressed emotions of the main characters that are manifested into their identical doppelganger. When a person denies the existence of their shadow, it becomes berserk, turn into a twisted representation of the character's repressed emotions, and ultimately utters the phrase before attempting to murder the person it came out of.

The top-voted comment was submitted by Redditor McGotham, who suggested that the series be called "Minor Mistake Marvin." The original draft of the story was written by Camden Lamont for his blog, Slack LaLane, on November 14, 2009.[1] He continued to update it until April 2011. It is set in 2009, ten years after the Caledon Local 21 channel supposedly existed. The story begins with the narrator Elliot recounting "Mr. Bear's Cellar," an eerie public access show starring a man in a bear costume. One episode involved Mr. Bear asking children to write him letters. A young Elliot wrote to Mr. Bear in 1999 and got a response, telling him to come to an address in Caledon. When Elliot's father took him there, police were excavating the house, and Elliot never heard from Caledon Local 21 again.[2] In the present day, Elliot investigates the history of Caledon Local 21, eventually finding a police station with several tapes from the channel. After watching the final episode of "Mr. Bear's Cellar," in which Mr. Bear burns his children playmates alive, Elliot is scarred by the realization that he could have met the same fate. He leaves the blog on a cliffhanger: he mentions an email address, seemingly belonging to Mr. Bear, that he thinks is a cruel prank. The story closes with him saying he'll update as soon as he can, implying the email was real and that he was somehow found by Mr. Bear.[2] On August 12th, 2008, YTMND user Herald77 submitted a page titled Michael Phelps is going Super Saiyan, which featured an animated GIF of olympic swimmer Michael Phelps turning into a Super Saiyan while celebrating at a competition (shown below).  On February 21st, 2012, redditor facebook_hero posted a GIF of a hopeless looking cat to the r/funny subreddit[1] titled "What the fuck am I doing with my life …" As of October 2014, the post has gained over 1,000 points. The word "Bro" originated as an abbreviation for the word “brother,” the title given to male siblings[1], not to be mistaken for the Catholic definition[2] of the term. The shortened version of “bro” appeared as early as the 1660s[3] in The History of the Parliament: The House of Commons 1690-1715[21] to denote brotherly relationships between members of Parliament. In 1912[4], people began using “brother” as a slang term in the United States to address one's close friends, which became further popularized after it was adopted by the African American community in the early 1970s. Similarly, the Hawaiian Pidgin English word “brah”[5] was brought into colloquial usage by American surfers as early as in the 1960s. Prior to its colloquial usage online, “bro” has been referenced in numerous films, TV shows[7][8] and video games[9] during the 1990s and 2000s. The Los Angeles Times[10] also used “bro” in an article published in November 2000, to describe George Bush’s participation in the fraternity Delta Kappa Epsilon during his time at Yale. On July 20th, 2011, Goudeau, along with accomplices Jeremy Goudeu and Keyron Elmore, allegedly forced their way into the motel room of 73-year-old pipefitter Juan Sustiata in Port Arthur, Texas and proceeded to beat and stab him before stealing his coin collection and debit card. Later that day, Donna Goudeau was arrested and proclaimed her innocence while being filmed by the local news station KBTV, claiming she was "lelgally blind" and could not have driven the getaway car. When being seated in the police car, she blurts up the phrase "Pimp squad baby, for life" (shown below). According to Texas court records, Goudeau was sentenced later that day to serve 18 years. On November 14th, 2005, Gov Teen Forums[6] member mikeduff919 submitted a thread titled "Is Stevie Wonder 100% Blind?", in which forum member Kard replied that he had seen an interview in which musician Boy George claimed he had been strangled by Wonder at a party. The special limited edition of the video game, Xenosaga Episode 2 Premium Box Set, was released on June 24th, 2004. Its price 17,800 Yen (About $166 at the rate at that time) was 3 times as expensive as that of the normal edition, and what made almost $100 difference between these editions was the figures of KOS-MOS[2], an android lady and the key character in this trilogy (shown below, left). However, the figures revealed at the release date were quite clumsy and its painting was awfully rough (shown below, center & right). It's known that Namco outsourced the figures production to a Japanese media company Enterbrain. On the same day as the releasing date, a Japanese figure freak posted a quite acrimonious review for the figures to his website.[3] That review said "It's terribly bad, sucks, nothing more than industrial junk.", "No movements or facial emotions.", "Is this a horror figure?" and "Enterbrain, Do not move into figure productions again!". This severe review for the poorly-made figure was soon shared on the web via Futaba Channel (2chan), 2channel and several popular otaku hub sites. Shortly after, the figure's sinister look was likened to Evil God, and people began to poke fun at the figurine with the nickname "Evil Goddess MOCCOS". "MOCCOS" comes from an anagram for the android's name, "MOCKOS", and it sounds quite stupid to Japanese sensibilities. On January 23rd, 2013, YouTuber Otis Anderson posted an edited clip from the Penn and Teller show Bull Shit featuring the 2003 rap song "Where the Hood At" by DMX with a gray fade out (shown below, left). The video was the original precursor, to the more popular "I'll kill your dog" rendition that followed a similar pattern (shown below, right). The formulaic set-up of the thug life remixes also bears resemblance to "How to Shut Down a Ho" remixes, another series of remix videos that open with a verbal insult or a punchline quoted from a popular film or television show before suddenly cutting to a scene of a crowd's wild reaction to the said line. The Slittens Tumblr[1] blog was launched on July 6th, 2014 with several photoshopped images of sloth-kitten hybrids (shown below). On December 13th, 2012, Redditor legit4u submitted an illustration titled "CanadianFeels.jpg," featuring a That Feel Guy seated at a computer desk in a log cabin with a Canadian flag on the wall (shown below).

The term "thug life" was initially popularized by American rapper Tupac Shakur[1], who started a rap group with the same name in late 1993 and released their only studio album Thug Life: Volume 1 in September 1994. The term continued to appear in numerous tracks by Shakur, most notably "Livin' the Thug Life" and "Thug 4 Life". The phrase in verbatim was quoted by Tupac Shakur for the first time in an interview with the California radio station KMEL in 1996. Following his death, the quote has been referenced by a number of other hip hop artists as well as Tupac's fans, mostly in paying respect to the artist's "thug life" philosophy. In January 2011, a Facebook fan page for the phrase[4] was created, which has gained over 31,600 likes as of August 2012. On September 11th, 2012, a series of anti-American demonstrations and violent attacks took place around the world, in response to Innocence of Muslims, an anti-Islam film allegedly produced and directed by Nakoula Basseley Nakoula that went viral upon its upload onto YouTube in July. Amidst the chaos on the streets in Benghazi, the capital of Libya, at least two U.S. diplomatic compounds were raided by Islamic militants, resulting in the deaths of U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, U.S. Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith, as well as two C.I.A contractors, and injuries of four American and Libyan personnels. While the attacks were initially reported as unfortunate casualties in connection to the violent protests against the film, further investigations determined that the attacks had been premeditated before the demonstrations began. In the following days, U.S. State Department officials were subsequently criticized for failing to increase security at the compounds prior to the attacks. Meanwhile on Twitter, conservatives began calling for the Obama administration to provide an explanation for failing to ramp up security, some of which accused officials of trying to cover up the tragedy with the hashtag #Benghazi.[2][4] The concept design of the Dubstep Gun was originally introduced in the eponymous YouTube video uploaded by LA-based video production collective Corridor Digital[1] on August 19th, 2011. The video illustrates an action-packed sequence wherein a team of three gunmen equipped in futuristic, Tron-like armor and Dubstep guns skirmish against a gang of bad guys carrying conventional weapons. As of October 2014, the video has racked up over 16 million views, which makes it the third most watched video ever to be produced by the group to date.

On September 13th, 2012, Chicago Bears' quarterback Jay Cutler became the subject of a minor controversy in the NFL blogosphere after the athlete was seen on camera yelling at his teammate and left tackle J'Marcus Webb before walking past him with a cold shoulder bump. Cutler's confrontational moment with his teammate quickly prompted criticism of unsportsmanlike behavior from the fans and other professional football players alike, leading the athlete to issue a statement regretting his actions (shown below): On the following day, Brandon Freeberg created the single topic blog smokinjaycutler[1] on Tumblr to feature a series of photoshopped images in which Cutler appears to be surly and smoking a cigarette on the field. On November 1st, 2011, a 5th grade teacher published a post on Blogspot[7] about using using construction paper to make "synonym rolls" teaching aids to help children learn to properly identify synonyms in context. On July 9th, 2014, Twitter user @placelikethis[1] tweeted "Made some synonym rolls" along with a photograph of freshly baked cinnamon rolls (shown below).

The earliest known use of Faux Cyrillic in popular media dates back to the 1966 American comedy film The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming[1] by Norman Jewison, which utilized Cyrillic letters in its promotional posters. The raids originated on a thread in the /war/ board of 8chan.[1][2] Another thread was made on 4chan's /pol/, but was quickly deleted by moderators. The plan was to get as many people as possible to leave 4chan, and come to 8chan. One of the earliest "fire alarm dance" videos was uploaded by YouTuber DustyRoxas[3] on October 28th, 2007.

The show subsequently aired a similar sketch in which Serafinowicz promotes the "Toilet Grenade" cleaning product by destroying a toilet (shown below). While the layout of “steal her style” posts has been a long-running format in the fashion publishing industry, and later, the fashion blogosphere, its earliest known application in meme-themed costume guides can be traced back to Know Your Meme's Hallowmeme costume catalogue launched on October 14th, 2009. The earliest known usage of the phrase “steal her look” in this context can be found in a Facebook page[3] titled “Steal Her Look," created on September 9th, 2010, within four years, the page has gained over 2,000 likes. The earliest known archived thread, where Harold first got attention, can be found on Facepunch, dating back to 2011. On September 13th, Facepunch forum user Greenen72, posted stock photos with the old man[1], originally from the site DreamsTime due to pictures having the site's watermark on them. After time spamming gore and erotic images the users of 4chan started posting carneval masks instead.

On December 29th, 2004, Urban Dictionary[1] user bretb submited an entry for the term "fuckboy," defining it as "a person who is a weak ass pussy." The exact origin of conspiracy theories regarding reptilian humanoids is unknown. Professor of political science at Syracuse University Michael Barkun, the idea may have been inspired by stories written by pulp fiction author Robert E. Howard, including his 1929 story "The Shadow Kingdom" which contained references to anthropomorphic snake people. In 1967, Nebraska-based police officer Herbert Schirmer claimed to have been abducted by reptilian humanoid aliens. 1337 first started on Bulletin Board Systems in which if you had elite status you could access the file folders, games, and V.I.P chatrooms. 1337speak uses ASCII characters to create words and emoticons like n00b (noob), 101, (lol[laugh out loud]), :] (a symbol representing a happy face which can be reversed to be :[, a sad face).

On August 11th, 2013, Imgur user jlct posted an image gallery[2] titled "Dads of the One Direction Concert" which featured pictures of middle aged men looking bored and uncomfortable in the midst of excited teenage girls attending a One Direction concert. Within a year the gallery gained over 920,000 views. The same day redditor jlctjlct added the album to the r/pics[3] subreddit. As of September 2014, the submission has gained over 4,000 points. The first appearance[1] of the zero suit comes from the end of the remake of the first game of the Metroid series: Metroid: Zero Mission. The suit also appears in other metroid games like Prime Hunters, Prime 2: Echoes and Prime 3: Corruption. The trend had increased in popularity with the Super Smash Brothers series. The oldest origins of the "shut the fuck up carl" can be traced back to a page called "Weknowmemes" which was posted in June 7, 2013.  Shorter X originated with Daniel Davies.[1] The original target was Steven den Beste, a blogger notably for lengthy posts in support of war with Iraq. In August, Facebook users began posting a copypasta message accompanied by a custom list of 10 selected books that continued to remain pertinent or meaningful. Additionally, participants would tag 10 friends with the message to continue its circulation on the social networking site. The earliest known public update was published on August 21st.[2] "In your status, list 10 books that stayed with you in some way. Don't think too hard. They don't have to be the "right" books or great books of literature, just ones that affected you in some way. Tag 10 friends including me so I can see your list." On February 8th, 2010, YouTuber Sindri Johannsson[11] uploaded a video titled "If Michael Bay Directed the Super Bowl" which featured Super Bowl footage with an explosion edited in. As of September 2014, the video has gained over 120,000 views.

As of September 2014, the video has gained over 400 views. The original sequence first appeared in Star Wars,[1] the first film in the original Star Wars trilogy, which was first released on May 25th, 1977. One of the earliest parodies was featured in The Bugs Bunny/Road-Runner Movie, which was first released on September 30th, 1979. After the events of The Fappening, in which a hacker posted nude photographs of various celebrities onto 4chan, many news outlets rushed to report about the event, often without proper fact-checking.[1] One such report (which has since been taken down) from the Australian branch of MTV identified the hacker as "a hacker known as 4 Chan," while the text in the article was changed to read "A hacker, known only as a user of website '4 Chan,'" later on, the original text read "A hacker known as '4 Chan' claims to not only have nude, risqué images but explicit videos …" (seen below). Due to the obvious error of identifying the hacker by the name of the site, many users on 4chan mocked the error by asking who 4chan was on the site itself. A similar event later occurred on CNN in a report about The Fappening where an interview with Brett Larson on Brooke Baldwin's show included the line, "Who is this 4 Chan?" The report was heavily mocked for little actual knowledge on technology and 4chan, receiving nearly 1.5 million views on CNN's YouTube[3] upload in six years (shown below). On August 26th, 2014, which is also National Dog Day, the official Twitter account[1] for @Midnight introduced the hashtag #DogBands, just before the episode which featured the hashtag in their recurring segments "Hashtag Wars" aired. On April 27th, 2010, the "Naked Banana" Facebook page was launched, featuring an illustration of an anthropomorphized banana holding its peel to the side as if it were clothing. On June 6, 2010, YouTuber Celyciah uploaded the peremptorily first source on the Internet, a shortcut clip titled Dinosauri antropomorfi dalle voci ambigue from the Italian version of animated film Dinosaur Adventure by Dingo Pictures, a low budget knockoff of the 1988 animated film The Land Before Time.[1] [2] The source video gained more than 350,000 views since its upload on YouTube. Original transcript: Translated transcript: On February 29, 2012, YouTuber revergo uploaded an edited version of the video with the title "Yee" accompanied with instrumentals from the movie itself. Within three years, the video gained over 2,000,000 views and 2600 comments.   The original sequence first appeared in the film Dr. No,[1] the original James Bond movie, which was first released on May 8th, 1963. One of the earliest parodies on film was featured in the opening sequences of a Monty Python sketch which aired in 1972. One of the earliest parodies created online, a video titled "James Bond spoof funny Gunbarrel scene" was uploaded by YouTube user Our Movies[2] on January 25th, 2007. The video features an actor reenacting the scene, but instead of shooting the assailant getting shot himself. As of September 2014, the video has gained over 110,000 views.  On April 26th, 1995, the comedy film Friday was released, starring the characters Craig Jones (played by Ice Cube) and Smokey (played by Chris Tucker) as a pair of unemployed stoners who must find a way to pay a drug dealer $200 within 24 hours. In the film, a character named Felicia attempts to borrow a car and a marijuana cigarette from Smokey and Jones, causing Jones to say "Bye Felicia." On March 11th, 2007, YouTuber HyFlyer988 uploaded a clip of the scene, gathering over 870,000 views and 290 comments in the first eight years. Felicia: Let me borrow a joint. Smokey:You need to borrow a job with your broke ass. Always trying to smoke up somebody's shit. Get the hell on Felicia. Felicia: I'm gonna remember that. Smokey: Remember it. Write it down. Take a picture. I don't give a fuck! Felicia:Craig? Craig Jones: 'Bye, Felisha. Felicia: Damn. Y'all stingy. Diggersby was first introduced in Pokémon X and Y, which were released worldwide in 2013.[5] The phrase "Diggersby Tho" comes from a stream on YouTube by shofu[6], shown below. The phrase is often considered to be a forced meme [4], due to the fact that it is often spammed on forums. As of August 28, 2014, Diggersby Tho has 3 separate Facebook communities, [7][8][9], and 1 Twitter account[10]. The anime was produced by studio BONES and aired between April and September 2006. Its opening theme song "Sakura Kiss" was sung by a Japanese female singer/idol Chieko Kawabe.[1] The pose came from Volume 2 of the popular manga series Yotsuba&![1], with the main characters Takashi, Kowai and Yotsuba. Adding shit right now hold your horses The TV anime series was produced by Kyoto Animation and aired 12 episodes between July and September 2013. Its ending theme "Splash Free!" was sung by Style Five, a group formed by the voice actors for main characters: Nobunaga Shimazaki[1], Tatsuhisa Suzuki[2], Tsubasa Yonaga[3], Daisuke Hirakawa[4], Mamoru Miyano[5]. And as same as their previous works, "Hare Hare Yukai" for The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya and "Motteke! Sailor Fuku" for Lucky Star, the studio inserts its favorite rendition, characters' smooth dancing which begins from 0:17 in the footage. Although it is unknown where did this meme appear online, and who posted it, the meme originated from a video clip, which viewed more than 28,000 times.  On August 18th, 2014, Threadingham posted a tweet to Quinn urging her to stand her ground in the face of criticism she was receiving after her ex boyfriend published an expose blog post about her alleged affairs with several men. The action cue used in the tweet "*nods respectfully toward you*" was mocked by Quinn's critics as an example of "white knight" behavior. Threadingham subsequently protected his tweets from being viewed by the public. Parody images of Threadingham and his tweet began circulating online that same day. The image macro originates from the trailer for World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor. In the trailer, Gul'dan is seen offering Grommash Hellscream a cup, which contains the blood of Mannoroth the Destructor, to which he adds "Drink, Hellscream. Claim your destiny. You will all be conquerors.". The screen blurs and you can see Garrosh Hellscream standing in the background of Grommash. Then, in response, Grommash answers: "And what, Gul'dan, must we give in return?". At this point Gul'dan pulls back his hood, revealing his red gaze, and exclaims: "Everything.". This leads to Grommash pouring the blood out of the cup, to which Gul'dan grunts. An evil laughter would then be heard in the background and Mannoroth comes forth, asking: "You, would reject this gift?". A battle then ensues between Grommash and Mannoroth. Trailer for World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor[2] A few minutes after the cinematic was released, a thread appeared on Reddit's /r/WoW board, MMO-champion[3] and also on wow-europe[1][4], where the cinematic[2] was posted. This prompted users to writing different parodies of the conversation in the comments. The original image was featured on the cover of the reference book Identifying Wood: Accurate Results with Simple Tools,[1] written by R. Bruce Hoadley and published in 1990.[2] The earliest known variation of the meme was created by adding the caption "Yep, it's wood." to the image, likely to highlight the humor behind writing an entire book dedicated to identifying something so commonplace. On August 17th, 2014, the Tumblr blog FoodThatLooksLikeIggyAzalea[1], which features pictures of Iggy Azalea next to pictures of food that looks similar to her outfit, make-up, or overall appearance was created. On the blogs FAQ page, the blog curator explaings: The blog is open to reader submissions. Along with dawn of the online video-sharing era in mid-2000s, Indian films became to reach a wider audience via YouTube and other video hub sites. In particular, their characteristic large scale dance scenes have inspired viewers to create mashups and parodies. These factors lead NND users to utilize those dances for audio-dubbing parodies. One of the earliest instances in this trend is a video titled "Lucky MegaStar" which dubbed ”Motteke! Sailor Fuku”, the theme song from Japanese TV anime Lucky Star, over "Kodithe Kottali" from 2003 movie Tagore[1] starring Indian "Megastar" Chiranjeevi.[2] The original video was uploaded to YouTube on June 22nd, 2007[3], and soon uploaded to NND the following month.[4] On August 18, in a Reddit thread,[4] an user named SillySladar claimed that Quinn intentionally sabotaged a female-centric game development event on the grounds that the idea was oppressive, in order to promote her own similar event, Rebel Jam (shown below, left).[2] On August 19th, The Fine Young Capitalists released a soundcloud recording containing their explanation as to what was going on and why they were doxxed.[1] On August 21, TFYC also gave an audio interview talking about the whole happening (shown below, right). On August 20th, 2014, Twitter user Africa_naptural called out United States President Barack Obama, television personality Oprah Winfrey, entrepreneur Bill Gates, musicians Don Jazzy, singer-songwriter Beyonce, R&B singer Akon, actor Brad Pitt, actress Angelina Jolie and actor Will Smith to pay for her tuition. While the exact origin of online appreciation for erroneous closed captions remains unknown, the earliest known article detailing the phenomenon of closed captioning FAILs was posted online by blogger Joe Clark on March 15th, 2006.[9] Later that same year, FARK[10] hosted a photoshopping contest for inappropriate or funny closed captioning in TV broadcast. The anime Humanity Has Declined aired from July to September in 2012, which featured the song "Real World" by the Japanese pop rock band nano.RIPE[1] in the show's opening sequence (shown below). The opening features several faeries performing a signature dance often associated with anime characters in shows by director Seiji Kish,[2] who including similar dances in opening credits for his previous works My Bride is a Mermaid[3] and Galaxy Angel Rune.[4] The latter inspired a fad called Pappara Dance on both Futaba Channel (2chan) and Nico Nico Douga (NND) in 2006-2008. On September 21, 2001, The Spongebob Squarepants episode entitled "Artist Unknown" aired.[1] The episode features a scene of Squidward showing off his artwork to a critic to be added to a collection. Squidward introduces one of the paintings named "Bold and Brash."[2] The critic replies with, "More like, Belongs in the Trash" and laughs as the artwork is collected by the janitor and thrown into the trash bin (shown below). "snow storm" was written by a Japanese composer dj TAKA for beatmaniaIIDX GOLD released for Japanese arcades on February 21, 2007. It was the 14th game in the beatmaniaIIDX series, a series of rhythm video games and the sequel to Beatmania that was first introduced by Konami in Japan on February 26, 1999. On June 8th 2013, Nico Nico Douga user 如月 銃駆 (Juke Kisaragi) uploaded a video titled "人を怒らせるMMD" ("How to Flip The Bird MMD" in English). In the first part of the video, two Vocaloid characters are talking to each other in Japanese, one seemingly trying to interrupt the other as she tries to speak to her. The other half of the video consists of an instructional sequence in which the Vocaloid character Miku Hastune gives the middle finger in three different ways, from the dullest to the most expressive. On March 4th, 2013, Tumblr user miikasaas[1] posted a set of GIFs from the anime Angel Beats! with the tags #that's it #that's the show, suggesting the two GIFs effectively summarize the show. As of August 2014, the post has gained over 6,000 notes. On December 12th, 2002, Runescape was updated with several new features, maps and non-player characters (NPCs), most notably a group of youthful gnomes who could be found in the Tree Gnome Stronghold. On August 10th, 2014, an unnamed teenager posted a tweet asking who would assist him in starting a "Louisville Purge" (shown below). On November 12th, 2000, the website HeadlineHumor.com[3] was launched, which highlights notable examples of funny newspaper headlines, classified ads and signs.  The exact origin of the term "listicle" is unknown. One of the earliest definitions of the word was submitted to the site for the public radio program Way With Words[2] on October 8th, 2004. On January 30th, 2009, Urban Dictionary[4] user Kageka submitted an entry for "showerthought," defining it as "an idea, thought or concept" that comes during part of a "morning routine."  The shock phrase originates from a joke guide for the videogame (shown below), that deceptively acts as a helpful page to teach players the "proper" way to greet and respond to an approach by another player. However, once the reader is directed to the main video, the reader is presented with an unseen neighbor knocking on the recorder's door while the recorder softly whispers the phrase, "I'm gonna… I'm gonna blow!" in a progressively louder voice before opening the door and shooting the knocking player in the face with a sawed-off shotgun. The video (seen below), rapidly grew in popularity due to many positive and hearty responses from readers who had laughed from the deceptively helpful guide. In mere days, the guide skyrocket in popularity and remained the most popular Steam Guide on Rust for weeks before eventually being replaced by legitimate guides. On August 5th, 2014, Elite Daily[1] published an article titled "#IfIWereABoy: 12 Women Share What They’d Do Differently If They Were Treated The Same As Men," which highlighted photographs of twelve staff members holding signs containing messages describing what they would do if they were men (shown below).  On November 30th, 2013, FunnyJunk[5] user taintedangel posted a screenshot of a Nintendo Mii character dressed in a green outfit resembling Link from The Legend of Zelda, with a speech bubble identifying himself as "Lonk from Pennsylvania" (shown below). This meme was spawned by an anonymous 4chan user in 2014 who claimed to be an IT consultant, despite having no credentials. In one of anons' passages, he is asked for his opinion on the best web browser. Anon forgets the name of the Chrome browser, and trying to save face, replies that he uses Google Ultron. The OP further elaborates the lie by saying it's used by NASA, but looks exactly like chrome. Harkening back to previous posts by the same anon author where he proves his 'skills' by (sometimes) downloading Adobe Reader, this software is also frequently referenced in the meme. "Particle Man" originally appeared on They Might Be Giants' third studio album Flood, released on January 5th, 1990.[1] The song contains verses for four different characters, including the titular Particle Man. In addition, the lyrics describe Triangle Man as Particle Man's nemesis, Universe Man as an enormous character the size of the entire universe and Person Man as garbage can-dwelling character who is "degraded."  On July 31st, 2014, Tumblr user aleksvitaly[1] posted a multi-pane image macro strip featuring photographs of Jordan “Kootra” Mathewson from the video game commentary group The Creatures and various screenshots of complementary comments about him posted by Tumblr users. In less than a month, aleksvitaly's post gained over 2,000 notes. On April 22nd, 2012, fashion blogger Gabi Gregg posted an article titled “Fatkini 2012”[1] with several photographs of herself dressed in a striped two-piece bathing suit (shown below). In the post, she encouraged her readers not to shy away from sporting bikini suits, regardless of one's body shape or body image. "As always, I truly encourage you guys to get to the beach (or a pool) this summer--don't let body shame keep you from having a good time! I don't expect everyone to feel comfortable in a two piece, but hopefully I can inspire some of you to take the plunge." This facial expression is struck by Ponoka-senpai, a high school girl representing the dark side of this manga, in the ninth episode of the show's first season aired on March 1st, 2013. She made the face after Mai insisted that she wants to watch that face on online live streaming programs by people trading FX. Mi explains that senpai looks like she couldn't distinguish between Japanese hiragana characters "Nu" (ぬ) and "Ne" (ね). On January 10th, 2013, Manning was photographed wearing a hood while warming up during football practice for the Denver Broncos in Englewood, Colorado (shown below).[1] Two days later, Redditor FusRoDah7 submitted the picture to the /r/nfl[3] subreddit, where it gathered upwards of 1,600 votes (91% upvoted) and 200 comments prior to being archived. In the comments, many Redditors mocked the size of Manning's forehead in the photo. Barneyfag's first identifiable post was on February 20th, 2012 on the /mlp/ board, where he responded to a thread asking about funny moments in the show.[1] He posted a screenshot of the schedule for Treehouse TV, in which it revealed that My Little Pony aired right after Barney, thus putting My Little Pony on the same level as Barney. The filename of the picture was "Bronies, this is your mindset." He would go on to post this photo several other times, either in existing threads or making new threads of his own (which would often get deleted). His first post on a board other than /mlp/ was on June 10th, 2012, where he posted it in a /co/ thread talking about Johnny Test.[2] It is unknown when exactly, but he would eventually start posting this picture in response to people posting My Little Pony content outside of /mlp/. He would often post it with the phrase "Die, you fucking Barneyfag" which made others give him the name Barneyfag. The earliest known instance of the meme in its current form was posted to FunnyJunk [1] on August 23rd, 2011, the same day the 2011 Virginia earthquake occurred. The image macro featured a picture of a plastic table and chair set with one chair tipped over, thus mocking the lackluster destructive power of the earthquake.    One of the first examples of humorous notations on sheet music published online was posted on ClassicalConvert[5] on January 25th, 2008. The piece, titled "Faerie’s Aire and Death Waltz" is so covered in notations it seems comical. According to an article on the Internet humor site Cracked,[6] "scrub" originated as a term for bad basketball players in the late 1990s. In January 1999, the R&B group TLC released the track "No Scrubs" as the first single off their third studio album FanMail. The song derides men who cannot afford their own residence and transportation, referring to them as "scrubs" (shown below). In October 2008, the gaming site Sirlin[9] published an article titled "Intermediate's Guide," which contained a section on "scrubs" defining them as players who are "handicapped by self-imposed rules that the game knows nothing about."  The Ghastly Gibus was released in the Haunted Halloween Special event in 2009. The hat was originally earned by visiting a hidden page on the TF2 website. After the Ghastly Gibus was given out to 10,319 players, it can no longer be earned from visiting the page. Instead, it can be earned through the achievement "Ghastly Gibus Grab", which requires the player to dominate another player wearing the Gibus. In 2011, when Team Fortress 2 became Free-to-Play, many new F2P players were seen wearing this hat, as they can not trade or find other hats. This quickly became a "sign" to players that that player is new to the game, and easy to kill. In 2012, during the Spectral Halloween Special, the Gibus got a new version, called the Ghostly Gibus, which would then be earned from the achievement instead of the Ghastly version. The Ghostly version is a bit taller, less dusty and has a ghost doll hanging from the top of the hat. Players who previously had the Gibus could now choose which style they want. Many newer players started wearing this version. Both hats are often paired with the "Pyrovision Goggles" accessory. On June 14th, 2014, San Francisco-based copywriter Claire Wyckoff[2] launched the Tumblr blog "Running Drawing,"[1] with her first post featuring a screenshot of a running trail resembling an amateur illustration of a dog (shown below). On August 1st, 2014, the San Francisco Giants played the first match in a four-game series against the New York Mets at Citi Field in Queens, New York. During the game, two fans were seen on TV holding signs which mocked Giants outfielder Hunter Pence, claiming he is the type of person who would commit the New York faux pas of putting ketchup on a hot dog and eating pizza with a fork. Later that day, the @MLBGIFs[1] Twitter feed posted an animated GIF of the hecklers, garnering upwards of 940 favorites and 860 retweets in the first week (shown below). On August 4th, 2014, YouTuber WNEP-TV[1] uploaded a video titled ""Apparently" This Kid is Awesome, Steals the Show During Interview." The video features WNEP-TV reporter Sofia Ojeda asking Ritter how he enjoyed one of the Wayne County Fair's rides. Ritter begins to ramble in reply, often punctuating his speech with "apparently" and insisting he had never been on live television. Within 48 hours the video gained over 4.1 million views. On August 4th, 2014 6:20am EST, the official KanColle Twitter account announced that the anime's preview had gone online on KADOKAWA's official YouTube account[2]. The trailer for the anime subsequently gained over one million views in less than three days[5]. While the anime had been anticipated, due to the large Japanese fandom already surrounding the game, one particular scene caught attention. The shot originally shows up 55 seconds in the preview, featuring the Aircraft Carrier Akagi holding a bow while skating on the water. The Tumblr blog Bass Dogs[1] was created on July 28th, 2013 by Scottish artist Michael M (@michaelmphysics).[2] One of the first posts tagged #mydashdidathing was published on August 18th, 2013 by Tumblr user aryanightshade,[1] featuring two separate posts from vloggers Dan and Phil. As of July 2014, the post has gained over 100 notes.

On April 16th, 2014, Viner Jessie G[1] uploaded a video titled “people seriously haters suck it,” which was unexpectedly removed almost a year after. In the video, she told those who have criticized her to “suck my ass”. Four months after the original video was published, it gained more than 11.3 million views, 283,000 likes and 56,000 comments. Many mirrors of the now removed video still exist on both Vine (one is shown below) and YouTube. George RR Martin published A Game of Thrones, the first book in the A Song of Ice and Fire series, which the HBO show Game of Thrones is based on, on August 6th, 1996.

On August 17th, 2011, Tumblr user effington[2] posted the same image, but this time, with the caption "hhhehehe" overlaid by the lizard's mouth in the style of interior monologue captioning. As of July 2014, the post has gained over 14,000 notes. The exact origin of the phrase "deep into YouTube" is unclear. The earliest known use of the expression in the context of bizarre content found on the video-sharing site was posted on February 5th, 2010 by Student Pilot Forums[2] member AirVenture, who commented about searching "deep into YouTube" to find a video of a woman regurgitating into a paper bag while flying in a jet airplane.   According to an article by Business Insider,[2] tin foil hats were first referenced as protection against mind interference in the 1927 science fiction short story The Tissue-Culture King by Julian Huxley, which features caps made of foil that are used by the story's protagonist to block telepathy. "Well, we had discovered that metal was relatively impervious to the telepathic effect, and had prepared for ourselves a sort of tin pulpit, behind which we could stand while conducting experiments. This, combined with caps of metal foil, enormously reduced the effects on ourselves." The earliest known examples of humorous tombstone epitaph were highlighted on Colorado resident June Shaputis' personal website Webpanda[1] in 1998 (shown below). The LifeCall commercial which features the line "I've fallen, and I can't get up" was first aired in 1989, and first uploaded to YouTube by YouTuber HauntedGeorge[1] on August 10th, 2007.

The article included a photograph of Dan Osborne, a cast member of the reality television series The Only Way is Essex, as a an example of the spornosexual aesthetic (shown below, right). On June 11th, 2014, Chinese artist Ai Weiwei uploaded an Instagram of himself holding up his one of his legs with both hands while sitting on a chair in nothing but a pair of shorts, socks and a straw hat. The accompanying caption in Chinese read: "Beijing anti-terrorism series." In less than a week, the photograph garnered more than 1,500 likes. One of the earliest incidents of the photo used as a meme was on April 30th, 2014, when 9Gag[3] posted the photo with the title "New meme incoming: Confused Black Lady." As of July 2014, the photo has gained over 80 points.  On January 31st, 2012, the "Gary the Goat" Facebook[1] page was launched, which highlights photos and video featuring Gary the Goat. In the next three years, the page gathered over 466,000 likes.  At the beginning of Nintendo's event at E3 on June 10th, 2014, the company played a video featuring a battle between Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aime and Nintendo of America CEO Satoru Iwata (shown below). This 17-year-old exchange student acted by a Japanese famous female voice actor Sakura Tange[3] has been appearing on the game since its first launch in October 2012, and one of the popular characters in over 70 girls from the very beginning of the service. However, many Japanese people except for the game players didn't know about her characteristic, speaking Japanese with strong French-like accent, till Ameba threw out a huge amount of TV adverts for the game's campaign during the year-end and New Year holidays in 2013-2014 (shown below).

[shown below] As of July 9, 2014, the video received 660,580 views. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wnnv5zySAk  The invention of the style has been credited to the 1990s SUNRISE TV anime series Brave Series[2] and two Japanese anime creators who were involved in its development: Masami Ōbari,[3] who has created the opening credit sequences for many titles in this series and whose individualistic drawing style has deeply affected to SUNRISE robot anime titles not only by himself but also by his followers since 1990s, and Mitsuo Fukuda,[4] who had attended to several early titles in this series as technical director or storyboard writer. On March 4th, 2014, the iggyazaleamusicVEVO[1] YouTube channel uploaded the music video for the track, which recreates scenes from the popular 1995 teen film Clueless. Within four months, the video gained over 81.4 million views and 56,000 comments.  On June 5th, 2014, Viner Nathan Moszyk[3] uploaded a video of his little brother Brady making high-pitched squealing noises while being hit in the head with a basketball (shown below). In the first week, the Vine gained over 233,000 revines and 225,000 likes. According to an interview with Vice[6] contributor Bauce Sauce, the prison pose gained popularity among rappers for album art in the late 1980s. In 1989, rappers Jay-Z and Jaz-O were photographed in crouching positions on the album art for the single "Hawaiian Sophie" (shown below).  The earliest known documented case of Nicolas Cage photos used in a prank was uploaded by YouTuber youjustgotcaged on February 11th, 2011, featuring footage of a friend's room covered in printouts of Nicolas Cage's face (shown below). In Season 3 Episode 1 of Futurama, originally aired on February 4th, 2001,[1] the male crew members of the Planet Express Ship are taken hostage by Amazonians, a tribe of giant women in an alien matriarchal society who use the word "snu-snu" as a synonym for sexual intercourse. Shortly after, the artificial intelligence leader of the Amazonians sentences the characters Zapp, Fry and Kif to "death by snu-snu" (shown below). Daguerreotype[1] is a photographic process introduced in 1839 in which an image is formed on a polished silver surface on top of a metal substrate like copper or brass. On May 29th, 2011, editor Michelle Legro launched the Tumblr blog "My Daguerreotype Boyfriend",[5] with the first post reblogging an early photograph of Russian physician and author Anton Chekhov (shown below). The 1st season of this anime, Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion, was aired from October 2006 to March 2007, and the source footage for this MAD series is taken from a scene in the 23rd episode in the season, where Zero, the alter ego of protagonist Lelouch Lamperouge, declares the foundation of the United States of Japan. On February 24th, 2014, Tumblr user batreaux[1] submitted a post quoting a text message conversation between himself and a girl in which he denies having an automated signature after being confronted for ending each message with "……………….slime man" (shown below). In the first four months, the post gained over 60,600 notes.   The earliest appearances of "ducking" in the place of "fucking" came in the late '90s on cell phones using T9 predictive text, which would complete words for you based on what it was likely to be. One of the earliest mentions of predictive text suggesting ducking was featured in the comments section of a post on the blog Ma.tt[7] on February 14th, 2005, titled "T9 Tip." User Jay Allen commented: The earliest Urban Dictionary[2] entry for ducking was added on August 30th, 2007, by user Kayne M. Dewhurst who defined it as: In Mean Girls, released on April 30th, 2004, the character Regina George (played by Rachel McAdams) scolds her friend Gretchen Wieners (played by Lacey Chabert) for using the term "fetch" as a synonym for "cool." Gretchen: "That is so fetch!" Regina: "Gretchen, stop trying to make fetch happen! It's not going to happen!" On March 1st, 2012, Redditor Keilantra submitted an image macro using a screen capture of McAdams in Mean Girls with a caption urging Google to abandon their efforts with the Google+ social networking service to /r/funny.[5] Prior to being archived, the post gained over 1,000 upvotes and 60 comments. According to a UVB-76 document titled "The Buzzer Primer"[12] by the international radio enthusiast group Priyom,[12] the first reports of UVB-76 transmissions ranged from 1976 to 1982. The earliest known recording of a UVB-76 broadcast was taken by Netherlands resident Ary Boender in January 1982 (shown below).  Pingu[4]is a British-Swiss stop-motion claymation TV series about a family of penguins in the South Pole that premiered on Swiss channel SF DRS on May 28th, 1986 and ran for six seasons over two decades, before concluding with the finale episode on March 3rd, 2006. In the series, the characters speak a made-up language known as "Penguinese," one of the most well-known phrases being "noot noot," which is mainly associated with the titular character. While various clips from Pingu have been used as a popular sample within the YouTube Poop community since as early as 2008, the catchphrase "noot noot" didn't gain momentum online until 2011. The first Urban Dictionary[2] entry for “Noot Noot” referencing its Pingu origin was posted on June 23rd, 2011, by user Enw Ffug who defined it as: According to Snopes,[1] an early version of the copypasta began circulating via e-mail as early as 1999. In the story, a college professor asserts that God must be evil if evil exists in the world, to which a student responds that “evil is simply the absence of God.” The final line reveals the student’s identity as Albert Einstein. Does evil exist? The university professor challenged his students with this question. Did God create everything that exists? A student bravely replied, "Yes, he did!" "God created everything? The professor asked. "Yes sir", the student replied. The professor answered, "If God created everything, then God created evil since evil exists, and according to the principal that our works define who we are then God is evil". The student became quiet before such an answer. The professor was quite pleased with himself and boasted to the students that he had proven once more that the Christian faith was a myth. Another student raised his hand and said, "Can I ask you a question professor?" "Of course", replied the professor. The student stood up and asked, "Professor, does cold exist?" "What kind of question is this? Of course it exists. Have you never been cold?" The students snickered at the young man's question. The young man replied, "In fact sir, cold does not exist. According to the laws of physics, what we consider cold is in reality the absence of heat. Every body or object is susceptible to study when it has or transmits energy, and heat is what makes a body or matter have or transmit energy. Absolute zero (-460 degrees F) is the total absence of heat; all matter becomes inert and incapable of reaction at that temperature. Cold does not exist. We have created this word to describe how we feel if we have no heat." The student continued, "Professor, does darkness exist?" The professor responded, "Of course it does." The student replied, "Once again you are wrong sir, darkness does not exist either. Darkness is in reality the absence of light. Light we can study, but not darkness. In fact we can use Newton's prism to break white light into many colors and study the various wavelengths of each color. You cannot measure darkness. A simple ray of light can break into a world of darkness and illuminate it. How can you know how dark a certain space is? You measure the amount of light present. Isn't this correct? Darkness is a term used by man to describe what happens when there is no light present." Finally the young man asked the professor, "Sir, does evil exist?" Now uncertain, the professor responded, "Of course as I have already said. We see it every day. It is in the daily example of man's inhumanity to man. It is in the multitude of crime and violence everywhere in the world. These manifestations are nothing else but evil." To this the student replied, "Evil does not exist sir, or at least it does not exist unto itself. Evil is simply the absence of God. It is just like darkness and cold, a word that man has created to describe the absence of God. God did not create evil. Evil is not like faith, or love that exist just as does light and heat. Evil is the result of what happens when man does not have God's love present in his heart. It's like the cold that comes when there is no heat or the darkness that comes when there is no light." The professor sat down. The young man's name -- Albert Einstein. Snopes determined that the copypasta was fictitious based on biographical information about Einstein and his expressed views on the subject of religion which have been described as "agnostic." While the origin of the letter "K" as a shorthand for "okay" remains unclear, the term most likely entered widespread usage during the onset of online multiplayer games and mobile texting in the early 2000s. On February 27th, 2003, Urban Dictionary[2] user Brian Black submitted an entry for the abbreviation, defining it as a “term of acknowledgement.” The Twitter account @Everyword[1] sent out its first tweet on November 30th, 2007, which featured the first word in the English language, “A.” The account was created by poet and computer programmer Allison Parrish[3][12] as her graduate project for the Interactive Telecommunications Program at New York University. The account is run by a Python script that consistently tweets one word every thirty minutes. It gets the words from a list Parrish found online which contains 109,229 words.[4] As of June 2014, the account has tweeted more than 109,0000 words in the English language and managed to gain over 95,000 followers. The account completed its task on June 7th, 2014. Autocorrection was first introduced in 1998 as a part of Microsoft Word '97[1] and has since become a part of many Microsoft and Apple Inc. devices, especially on mobile phones and tablets. In 2008, stories about autocorrect blunders began hitting the news when the Guardian[4] published an article on the American Family Association's oversight of running a story in which the last names of people with the surname "Gay" had been changed to "Homosexual." In November 2008, Flickr user Merrick Monroe[5] uploaded a screenshot of a conversation between her and a friend in which the autocorrect function humorously changed the meaning of their messages. The Tumblr blog GuysWithZooEyes[1] was created on May 20th, 2014. The first image post featured an image of actor Nick Offerman (shown below, right), who portrays the character of Ron Swanson in Park and Recreation, with Zooey Deschanel’s signature blue eyes. Within two weeks, the post gained over 200 notes. Rikka's finger Spin appears on the opening movie of the 1st season for the TV anime series aired in October to December 2012. This opneing movie itself also became to a popular subject for the op parodies on NND. The finger spin is inserted in the beginning of the climax part of the song. However, its length is just 2 seconds. On April 8, 2014, Nintendo released their newest trailer for the new Smash Bros, unveiling the Pokemon characters Charizard and Greninja. Although Charizard was revealed early in the video, Greninja was shown as a mysterious silhouette for a large portion, which bore an uncanny similarity to another Pokemon character, Mewtwo. Mewtwo had been a popular character in Super Smash Bros. Melee, an earlier game in the series, and many fans had been clamoring for his return. Upon seeing the silhouette, many viewers immediately assumed it was Mewtwo, an assumption bolstered by the blue energy the mysterious figure produced. Upon the reveal of the figure as the newcomer Greninja, many fans were disappointed. The word ratchet has been traced back to Shreveport, Louisiana, specifically the Cedar Grove neighborhood. In 1999, rapper Anthony Mandigo[3] released a song titled "Do the Ratchet," a track on his album Ratchet Fight in the Ghetto. In 2004 Mandigo's song was remixed and re-released with rappers Lil Boosie and Untamed Mayne, the video for which sparked a ratchet dance trend which involves shifting your weight from one foot to the other while swinging your arms to twist at the waist. The music video was first uploaded to YouTube on October 10th, 2006, by YouTuber Adetiba 'Super-Director'.[4] On April 19th, 2011, Redditor Juu-hachi submitted an animated GIF featuring a stabilized clip from the Patterson-Gimlin of an unidentified subject purported to be the cryptid known as "Bigfoot" to the /r/pics[2] subreddit (shown below). Prior to being archived, the post received over 500 upvotes and 70 comments. Luigi's illusive stare was first picked up by a video titled "Waluigi vs Luigi" (shown below, left), which was posted to YouTube by Rizupicorr[1] on May 30th, 2014, which shows a section of a highlight reel in which Luigi knocks out Waluigi using a green shell, before giving him an uncomfortable stare as he continues to drive past, and gained over 60,000 views. Another video, titled "Mario Kart 8 – Luigi's Death Stare" was also posted to YouTube the same day by user Mega Beardo[2](shown below, right), featuring Luigi attempting to overtake Mario, gaining over 5,000 views. The original YTMND, simply entitled "Uber New Hax", was created by user Bumbastic on July 31st, 2005.[2] It used footage from the 2002 film Spider-Man, and depicted a storyline in which Norman Osborn team-kills and bans his former Oscorp clan members after being kicked out of leadership duties (shown below). The YTMND went on to gather over 1,900 votes (with a site average of 4.21/5.00), over 160 favorites, over 450 comments, and over 260,000 views.[3]   The song "Hitachi Tree" was composed by Asei Kobayashi[2] who also composed "Humans are Nice", and its lyrics was written by Akira Itou.[3] This song is played in Hitachi's famous TV advert running from 1973, which is an image advert which just displays names of Hitachi's group companies/branches in each regions before a backdrop of a large tree. And because the lyrics begins from the line "What kind of tree is this tree?", this song is better known as this alias among many Japanese people. The tree in the adverts is also known as the "Hitachi Tree", and the most famous one is a monkeypod which grows in Moanalua Gardens, Hawaii.[4] Hitach, officially recognizes that tree which has appeared on the adverts since 1984 as its corporate symbol[5], has the agreement of the exclusive right in commercial uses for the tree with the owner of the park. "Kiiiihara-kuuuuuuuuun!!" is not a transcript from the anime but an actual line in the Academy City Invasion arc of the novels. The scene where Accelerator provokes Amata Kihara[1], an antagonist in this arc, with this maddish utterance appears on the 9th chapter in the arc included in the 13th volume of the novel released in April 2007. Meanwhile in the TV anime series, other Accelerator's shouts in the battles with Kihara are also called as this line among viewers. The first footage for those "Kiiiihara" utterances is a trailer for the 2nd season which was published in August 2010 (shown below, left). Then, it appeared in 19th-22nd episodes aired on February to March 2011 (shown below, right). On January 4th, 2014, Cincinnati-based filmmaker John Cain uploaded a video titled "Reporter fired for remarks about missing woman on LIVE TV" which shows a reporter for a FOX-affiliated local news station making inappropriate remarks on camera, including the line "I'll fuck her right in the pussy." On January 7th, Cain's video was highlighted by Ray William Johnson in an episode titled "Things That Kill," giving further boost to its virality on YouTube. As of late May 2014, the video has garnered nearly 2 million views. On May 12, 2014, a day before the release of the second theatrical trailer of the movie. TFW2005 members ILikeSoundwave & SilverOptimus reported news on the site from an Article on USA Today featuring Three new Stills for the Movie. One Includes of a Poster that has Optimus Prime Kneeling on the Ground. Within minutes & hours since the news, Fans across the site had made Image Marcos of the poster featuring Captions based on what if Prime was Doing and/or Saying.[1] On August 5, 2014, two days after the movie reached the 1 billion dollar mark in box office receipts. The poster now became the cover for the film's blu-ray 3D combo pack release.[2] In 1908, the first ceremonial first pitch was thrown by former Japanese Prime Minister Ōkuma Shigenobu at a game in Koshien, Japan. In 1910, the American ritual began at the Griffith Stadium in Washington, D.C., where the 27th President of the United States William Howard Taft threw a ceremonial first pitch at an Opening Day game between the Washington Nationals and the Philadelphia Athletics. On May 17th, 2014, American software developer Bob Lannon launched @SummaryBug, a blog devoted to highlighting incoherent synopses that had been accidentally spliced together, on Twitter[1] and Tumblr.[2] Within two weeks of launch, @SummaryBug has posted over 110 instances of summary bugs and garnered more than 8,590 followers.  During Game 5 of the NBA Eastern Conference finals between the Indiana Pacers and the Miami Heat on May 28th, 2014, Indiana Pacers' Lance Stephenson was caught on camera bending down next to his opponent Lebron James and gently blowing air into his left ear, to which the Miami Heat forward reacted by shaking his head in disapproval (shown below). Immediately after the game, the sports blog Terez Owens tweeted a photoshopped screen capture of Stephenson blowing smoke rings. #LanceStephenson be like #INDvsMIA pic.twitter.com/ELXKrS7Pvp The phrase was originally used as an intentional misspelling of "human being" in the 1952 children’s novel The Borrowers,[1] in which the miniature humans known as the "borrowers" refer to the average-sized humans as "human beans," to mimic how young children may mispronounce it. The earliest known satirization of "human bean" as a commonly misspelled word appeared in the webcomic Monkey Business[2] in a strip titled “Human Bean,” published on November 6th, 2003. Smokey the Bear was originally introduced in 1944 after propaganda rose to prominence during World War II.[1] The first poster featuring the mascot (shown below) was released on August 9th of that year, reminding hikers to put out their campfires after they were finished using them. The character grew greatly in popularity in the following years, appearing in a variety of media and even serving as the namesake for legislation on fire safety.  Sarah McLachlan's ASPCA ad was first uploaded to YouTube on October 3rd, 2006, by user ragefc[1]. As of May 2014, the video has gained over 1.5 million views.  The characteristics of logo for this light novel series are its circuitous wording beginning from "A Certain…" (とある, Toaru) and a gimmick that reads a Kanji word "禁書目録" (Kinsho Mokuroku; lit. "Index of Forbidden Books") as a character's name "Index" by putting English subtitles written in Katakana (インデックス, Indekkusu) under/beside the word. In a similar vein, its spin-off titles, A Certain Scientific Railgun and A Certain Scientific Accelerator, also read "超電磁砲" (Chou Denji Hou; lit. "Super Electromagnetic Gun") as "Railgun" and "一方通行" (Ippou Tsuukou; lit. "One Way") as "Accelerator", both of which are a name/alias of the main character. This unique wording style became to be widely known among Japanese Otakus after the original TV anime for A Certain Magical Index started in October 2008.  On April 23rd, 2009, Ashleigh K. Rajala published a post titled "my life according to the latest facebook meme," on her blog Sandpaper Blue.[2] Rajala described the survery as "the latest Facebook meme, the “My Life According to [insert favourite band here]." Rajala completed the survey twice using songs from The Clash (shown below) and The Smiths. The earliest known use of the question "Is this Attack on Titan?" on Tumblr was posted by user minty-bee on July 7th, 2013. In the post is a close-up of girl whose face is partially covered by a blanket, somewhat reminiscent of one of the titan characters in the show. Despite the later popularity of the phrase, minty-bee's post went largely ignored with only one note [1]. The original image is one of promotional pictures for the 2007 thriller film No Country for Old Men. The picture comes from a scene between Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) and Deputy Wendell (Garret Dillahunt). On July 7th, 2011, sprite artist CosbyDaf, a frequent contributor to horror website Bogleech,[3] posted the first chapter of the creepypasta story titled "Earth & Mars" to the blog NES Godzilla Creepypasta.[1] The primary antagonist of the story (Red) is thought to be inspired by a rumored Godzilla movie pitting the King Of Monsters against Satan, given that the character shares many transformations with the hypothetical Kaiju version of the Biblical figure.[4] The video game screenshots included in the story contained sprites created or modified by CosbyDaf, including many Godzilla Kaiju and several of his own creations. "only my railgun" was written and performed by the Japanese trance/pop duo fripSide[1] as the first opening theme for the anime A Certain Scientific Railgun, which premiered in Japan on October 3rd, 2009. The song was then officially released as a single on November 4th, 2009 and later on the group's album "Infinite Synthesis" on December 1st, 2010, with both being the first to feature singer Yoshino Nanjō as the group's lead vocalist. This song "Square Timber" was written by Ryo Nagamatsu[2], a Japanese composer belonging to Nintendo (shown below, left). Since it's the theme song for Puzzle Plank Galaxy[3], the 1st galaxy of World 2 in Super Mario Galaxy 2, this song is better known for this stage name. Additionally, "Square Timber" is also included in Mario & Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic Games.[4] Meanwhile, this song became to be utilized in MAD videos after a video titled "Au Au Au" was uploaded to NND on November 9th, 2012 (shown below, right). This MAD video featured "Au!", an iconic Moe interjection of Rikka Takanashi from a Japanese light novel/anime Love, Chunibyo & Other Delusions. On June 22nd, 2013, YouTuber Kaye Trill uploaded a hip hop track titled "Do It For The Vine," featuring lyrics describing the practice of making Vine videos with mobile devices (shown below). According to Snopes,[8] a myth claiming that "the average person swallows eight spiders per year" originated from a 1954 collection of common misconceptions regarding insect folklore. In 1993, the claim was reprinted in an article written by columnist Lisa Holst in PC Professional, which contained a list of false statements mocking misinformation that had been circulating in a viral e-mail. The false factoid subsequently circulated widely across the Internet as truth. On January 9th, 2013, Tumblr user Max Lavergne[1] submitted a blog post about the often-quoted factoid, asserting that people eating "three spiders a year" is actually a statistical error due to a man named "Spiders Georg" who consumes "over 10,000" of the arachnids each day. “average person eats 3 spiders a year" factoid actualy (sic) just statistical error. average person eats 0 spiders per year. Spiders Georg, who lives in cave & eats over 10,000 each day, is an outlier adn should not have been counted” This Shift-JIS art of a person smiling with holding up both arms, "＼(^o^)／", has been used for expressing one's joy in young girls texting since the end of 90s. And this simple Shift-JIS had been also used in the same positive meaning among online communities though its use frequency was very occasional compared to 2channel Shift-JIS arts represented by Monā and Giko. A 2channel's thread known for the first instance including "＼(^o^)／" in its title was posted on /game/ board on November 25th, 1999.[1] It was used to express a submitter's pure love to Aya Hasebe, a character from a Japanese adult game Comic Party.[2] Meanwhile, it was in the late 2005 when "＼(^o^)／" began to be utilized in a quite bad meaning in 2channel. Users in that anonymous textboard community reinterpreted that innocent smile as an expression for profound despair of people who have no choice but to laugh with throwing up their hands, and associated it with the phrase "My Life Is Over" (人生ｵﾜﾀ, Jinsei Owata). Villain Holding Koalas[1] was created on May 12th, 2014 by Tumblr user champagnemanagement,[2] who had previously launched other humorous single topic blogs, including Worst Thrift Shop Ever[7] and Baby Sinclair Fan Club.[8] The conflict first appeared online on YTMND when user OrochimaruKuKu uploaded a site called "The Passion Of The Burger King"[3] on March 29th, 2005.[2] The YTMND featured an image of the Burger King being tortured by a group of Ronald McDonald clones in a way similar to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ (shown below). As of May 2014, the site has gained over 10,000 views. One of the earliest commencement speech videos to go viral online was Apple founder Steve Jobs’ address to Stanford University’s graduating class on June 12th, 2005. The video was uploaded online for the first time via Apple History's YouTube channel[1] on March 6th, 2006, followed by another version uploaded via Stanford University’s[2] YouTube channel on March 7th, 2008. However, Steve Jobs' speech received much of its online exposure following his death in October 2011. The two versions have racked up more than 27 million views in aggregate as of May 2014. The standard periodic table layout was developed by American chemist Horace Groves Demin in 1923 based on Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev's earlier version from 1871 (shown below). The exact origin of periodic table parodies is unclear. According to the Internet Database of Periodic Tables,[9] artist and chemist Joseph Di Gregorio illustrated "The Periodic Chart of Contemporary Elements" in 1980, which contained pop-culture terms in place of the original elements (shown below). On January 4th, 2013, Redditor lky1991 submitted a photograph of his friend posed in front of a group of penguins in Antarctica to the /r/pics[4] subreddit, noting that she had traveled to every continent in the world before her 21st birthday (shown below). The post was met with mixed reception on Reddit, garnering 2,800 upvotes, 2,035 downvotes and 860 comments prior to its archival, with the most upvoted comment thread scorning the woman for presumably having had wealthy parents who could financially support her journey around the world. On the following day, Redditor kickinfatbeats submitted an image macro of the photo titled "Entitlement Girl" with the caption "Look at this life accomplishment / my parents bought for me" to the /r/AdviceAnimals[1] subreddit (shown below). Before the post was archived, it accumulated more than 14,900 upvotes and 1,100 comments. Common among elementary school children, the check yes or no note dates back to the 19th century[4] when the yes or no question would be posed on humorous, joking calling cards (shown below) young men would give to young women to inquire whether they could walk them home. On December 20th, 2007, an early version of the Fistful of Frags Half-Life 2 mod was released on the game modification website ModDb.[5] On May 9th, 2014, an updated version of the mod was released as a free download on Steam.[1] In the game, players can repeat the phrase "Pass the whiskey" among other voice commands (shown below). On May 15th, 2014, Redditor Problydrunkrightnow submitted a vertical-oriented image macro of a dog cracking a joke about NASA to a baby in an /r/AdviceAnimals[5] post titled "Their expressions were too good to pass up" (shown below). While the image itself was originally titled "Discussion Dog,", it was soon re-dubbed "Dad Joke Dog" by Redditor waylaidbyjackassery in the comments.  The earliest known example of a "cat fort" photograph was submitted to the r/Trees[2] subreddit on March 30th, 2010 by Redditor jamullah, though the original post has since been removed. The earliest known "cat fort" post that still remains accessible was submitted to the r/pics[3] subreddit on April 23rd, 2010 by Redditor windowbird. During the 2012 Christmas holiday, Rhinehart was inspired to leave his job as a software engineer to work on creating a food substitute after witnessing an elderly, injured friend struggle to feed himself.[9] With no formal education in nutrition, Rhinehart consulted online courses, books and other reference materials to determine what nutrients are essential in a balanced human diet. On February 13th, 2013, Rhinehart published an article on his personal blog titled "How I Stopped Eating Food,"[1] which described how he concocted a liquid shake comprised of various substances to meet a human's daily nutritional requirements.

With the release of the original Metroid game in 1986, the creature was originally depicted as a purple dragon roughly the size of Samus. In Super Metroid, released in 1994, Ridley's size was increased to about three times the height of Samus. On May 19th, 2006, Smash Boards Forums[6] member xianfeng submitted a thread titled "Ridley for SSBB," which contained a proposal for Ridley to be included as a playable character in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, complete with a list of fighting moves. In the thread, user =TF=Omega argued that Ridley was "too big" and that a scaled down version of the character would be "awkward."

Immediately after kissing her, Dio gloats about beating Jonathan to her first kiss by saying “Your first wasn’t JoJo! It was me, Dio!” However, the quote gained much of its traction through its inclusion in the pilot episode of the anime series,[3] which premiered in Japan on October 5th, 2012.

When he inserts the tape into a audio cassette player instead of a Commodore 64 console, a loud, screeching static noise can be heard emanating from the cassette player, prompting Jon to stare blankly at the camera with a frightened look. The caption "(ACTUAL NOISE IT MADE)" appears below Jon's confused face, emphasizing that he did not alter the sound in post-production.

In the mid-to-late '00s, the porn torrent site cheggit.net was strongly encouraging people to post thank-you responses to uploads. This elicited people to post generic thank-yous. The user "zedemonio" started posting thank-yous that contained only the all-caps text: "TNXS. I LOVE YOUNG GIRLS INTO PLAY". Over time, zedemonio posted this to an overwhelming number of uploads (including uploads where it made even less sense, such as MILF porn) to the extent that even the most infrequent user of the site would see it very frequently. Users started responding to zedemonio's posts, with no commensurate reply. Eventually, a Cheggit admin changed his avatar from the generic default to a picture of Mankini Borat with girls, similar to the icon shown here. No one is aware of any response from zedemonio. It has been theorized that zedemonio was not a native English speaker and probably used an automated download tool that automatically posted his thank-yous. If so, it's possible he never knew that anyone ever responded to him, that his avatar was ever changed, or that there was ever any interest in him at all. The statement he posted changed very slightly over time, but when the changes occurred, they were clean breaks from one version to another. The earliest known "Me vs. You" image macro was posted by Tumblr[1] user fuckeverylastoneofyou on June 11th, 2012, which identified a girl falling off a broken swing as "you" and her swinging partner as "me" (shown below).

On April 26th, 2006, YTMND user cdawg82191 uploaded a YTMND entitled "Holy Crap, A Meteor!" featuring a period punctuation mark that resembled a meteor that would imminently impact into Columbia, South Carolina.[2] The site was originally made as a joke[3], but it was met to a degree of acclaim from users, allowing the site to accumulate over 7,200 votes (with a site average of 4.40/5.00), over 290 favorites, over 1,700 comments, over 131,000 views, and a $0.01 sponsorship from another user.[4] On October 5th, 2012, Twitter user @Free_Reign_Flyb[10] posted two tweets with the hashtag "#NationalSendANudeDay" (shown below).   Threads for talking about topics by JJBA's unique wording style had been occasionally posted to 2channel's each boards since early 2000s. And Shift-JIS arts of characters or panels became to be put together with users' posts in late 2004 or early 2005 by the technical progress of 2channel Shift-JIS arts. In this background, there is the huge demand for Shift-JIS arts which have been playing the role of exploitables or reaction faces in that pure text board community which isn't able to upload images. Many famous scenes/characters in the manga were given its Shift-JIS art version in those days. Among them, what has been leading the popularity of the JJBA Shift-JIS arts since quite early days is the Shift-JIS art for Jean Pierre Polnareff[1], one of the main characters in the 3rd & 5th arc of JJBA. It's also known as "Polnareff Shift-JIS Art" (ポルナレフAA) or called by its most famous line "Let me tell you what happened!" (ありのまま起こった事を話すぜ!, Arinomama Okottakoto wo Hanasuze!). This Shift-JIS art is consisting of citing 2 panels in the 249th chapter titled "Dio's World Pt. 3" where Polnareff is trying to explain Dio's stand power that he experienced. This episode is included in the 27th volume of JJBA comic book series released in 1992. This is the most well-used Shift-JIS art among those JJBA Shift-JIS arts because his wording in this scene is quite easy to fit to explain various situations, or to ridicule other silly users in the threads. According to The Guardian,[2] the shooter sandwich was originally made during the Edwardian era as a portable beef Wellington that could be prepared a day in advance.

While the blog's content was initially limited to off-putting messages that the blogger herself had received on dating sites, it quickly began featuring screenshots of chat logs submitted by other Tumblr users. On April 14th, 2014, Redditor Please_Stop_PMing_Me submitted a Success Kid image macro to the /r/AdviceAnimals[1] subreddit, which confessed to tricking his girlfriend into thinking he had irritated a made up body part called the "underloaf" (shown below).

The meme eventually became known as "Yo, Fryman!" after numerous sequel threads appeared on the site under the same title, which in itself is a reference to the way Brutananadilewski often addresses Frylock, another main character from the show. The origin of the phrase may be attributed to the comic (picture below), originally posted somewhere in 2009, where a stick figure is acting like a "retard" in front of two others. One of them calls out the retard, but then he reveals that he was "only pretending." The earliest archived example of the comic can be traced back to November 29th, 2009, on 4chan's /a/ (Anime and Manga) board[1].

In each level, the player is accompanied by an artificial intelligence guide named Skylar, who would mockingly say “where did you learn to fly?” whenever the ship is on a collision course against its surroundings (shown below). On March 24th, 2009, GameFAQs Forum[2] member EdwardoMario16 submitted a thread titled "Crash Where did you learn to fly?" in the Cybermorph board. On the following day, the Angry Video Game Nerd uploaded a video titled "Atari Jaguar (Part 2)," which included a review of Cybermorph. When Skylar is shown repeating the phrase "Where did you learn to fly?," host James Rolfe reacts by shooting her with a gun and replying "Where you learn to be an asshole?" (shown below). Wheel of Fortune premiered on January 6th, 1975, on NBC. The earliest known online parody of the puzzle board game was submitted in text form, rather than as an image, to the Pokecommunity[6] forum by user Shana on July 7th, 2004. In the thread, the OP (original poster) laid out the Pokemon themed puzzle game by explaining: The game continued to be played within the thread for almost one month. The exact origin of the term "basic bitch" is unknown.

Magnotta also performs necrophilia on the body and cut off a part of the body and stuck it on a knife. There was no evidence that cannibalism was actually performed on the body. At the Gamescom conference in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany held in August 2012, Machinima host Adam Kovic interviewed Far Cry 3 producer Dan Hay, saying the game was "like Skyrim with guns." Adam Kovic: I didn't realize what you guys were demoing and it's open world… and I've already told you this, but it feels like Skyrim with guns. Boyfriend Twins[1] was launched on April 6th, 2014 by a Tumblr user who wishes to remain anonymous. In an interview with BuzzFeed[2], the creator said he decided to start the blog after discussing the concept with a friend, initially dubbed "doppelbangers," in order to “start a conversation about narcissism, exhibitionism and sexuality." The earliest known funny exam answers posted online were highlighted on the BBC News[5] Lancanshire blog on August 28th, 2002, which cited a reader named Sam as the source of the answers. "For Fainting: Rub the person's chest or, if a lady, rub her arm above the hand instead. Or put the head between the knees of the nearest medical doctor." The exact origin of the term "muh" is unclear. On June 6th, 2003, Urban Dictionary[4] user wyckid submitted an entry for "muh," defining it as a synonym for the word "my."  In the closing scene of the pilot episode of the animated television series Archer, originally aired on September 17th, 2009, Malory Archer, the mother and supervisor of the titular character Sterling, notices several donuts scattered across the floor and scolds her son, “Do you want ants? Because that’s how you get ants!” (shown below). On January 23rd, 2010, a Facebook[1] page titled “Do you want ants? Because that’s how you get ants!” was launched. The original photograph was taken of a hill in Napa, California on June 24th, 1996, by photographer American photographer Charles O’Rear.[1] Window XP was first released to the public, with the default wallpaper, on October 25, 2001. The first parody was published on a message board thread on Getpaint.net[2] titled "The Bliss Parody Gallery," which was started on July 19th, 2006. The first edited image was submitted by forum user wontstoptalkinga on July 20th and featured fighter jets flying through the sky. The earliest known marriage proposal video was uploaded by YouTuber Dave11 on October 25th, 2005, which featured a woman rejecting a man's proposal in the middle of a basketball court (shown below). The images are taken from the final scene in Finding Neverland in which Barrie promises Peter to always be there for him and assures him that his dead mother has gone to Neverland (shown below). The original image macros are rumored to have originated on 4chan sometime in 2008, but no archived threads have been found. Said by announcer, Rick Rizz[1], on April 11, 2001, and used again in PBS' documentary, The Tenth Inning[2], the phrase, "Ichiro laser beam!" became quite popular; frequently replayed in Japan. This created some minor controversy in American media, doubting whither Ichiro lived up to his hype. On March 5th, 2014, 3:18 PM (ET), a photograph of British prime minister David Cameron discussing the 2014 Crimean Crisis on the phone with President Obama was tweeted via Cameron's official Twitter account.[6] I've been speaking to BarackObama about the situation in Ukraine. We are united in condemnation of Russia's actions. pic.twitter.com/7Rk2k8iOIK</p>&mdash; David Cameron (David_Cameron) April 9, 2014 Over the course of the month, the photo has been retweeted over 9,000 times and received over 4,000 favorites. The interview which Ichiro says "I was almost coming" aired after the victory ceremony in the 2009 World Baseball Classic on March 23rd, 2009. Regardless of the context in dialogue, it was nevertheless seen as an unacceptable expression for broadcasting. Eventually, Ichiro released a public apology by saying "Sāsen", an easy pronounciation of "Sumimasen" (lit. "I’m sorry."): This meme originated from an interview with Ichiro at Safeco Field, the home stadium of the Seattle Mariners that he was belonging to. A screenshot of Ichiro coincidentally shaking his head was taken by a Japanese internet user. And, the caption in this screenshot is his answer to interviewer "I'm getting excited". In the Japanese language, "Tension" (テンション) is a loanword from English which means degrees of excitement or motivation, and it has no negative nuance. For example, Hi-tension (テンションが高い, Tenshyon ga takai) is meaning of "Excited", and Low-tension (テンションが低い,Tenshyon ga hikui) is meaning of "Not excited" or "Unmotivated". However, it's a casual expression which is seldom heard in interviews with middle-aged athletes like Ichiro even in those days. On March 31st, 2014, Instagram user Julieamalone[1] uploaded a video in which she strums the stomach of her cat like a string instrument with a guitar instrumental track playing in the background. In two weeks, the video has gained over 90 likes. On March 27th, 2014, the official trailer for Michael Bay's upcoming film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was released via YouTube. In the last scene of the trailer, Michelangelo makes a dramatic appearance before his future human ally April O’Neil and tries to reassure the frightened reporter that his bandana is “just a mask” before scaring her even more by revealing his anthropomorphized turtle face (shown below, left). Within two weeks, the trailer received more than 30 million views and 29,000 comments. On the following day, YouTuber AJ Jefferies posted an edited version of the scene in which Michelangelo removes the mask to reveal the head of a ninja turtle from the 1990 live-action film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (shown below, right). On May 26th, 2009, the Crappy Taxidermy[3] Tumblr blog was launched, which highlights humorous photos of taxidermied animals. The blog's first post featured a mounted squirrel with a menacing expression and sharp, jagged teeth (shown below). The character of Claude Frollo originates from the Victor Hugo novel of the same name. In the novel, Frollo is portrayed as the Archdeacon of Notre Dame; highly intelligent, yet easily irritated. One night, Frollo finds and rescues an abandoned baby Quasimodo on the steps of the cathedral. Instead of raising the deformed hunchback reluctantly, Frollo willingly raises Quasimodo as his own son. All of this, however, decays, when he becomes infatuated with the gypsy Esmeralda.[1] The rest of the novel shows Frollo slowly dive into madness, and becomes not unlike the version of him as portrayed in the Disney film. In the Disney adaptation of the novel, Frollo is described as a heavily religious Parisian justice minister, who is best known for his ruthlessness in upholding "justice" and utilizing his religious status to justify any of his deeds; be it good or evil.[2] Instead of finding Quasimodo on the steps of Notre Dame, he unwillingly kills Quasimodo's gypsy mother, unknowingly doing such within the boundaries of sanctuary of the cathedral. Realizing his sin, Frollo reluctantly agrees to raise Quasimodo, but continues to treat him as subhuman. Similar to the novel, Frollo becomes infatuated with Esmeralda, but goes to even greater lengths to take her for himself (such as ordering the burning of a farmhouse with its family of wrongly-accused gypsy sheltering.) On February 19th, 2006, a promotional website was launched for the “universal bullshit detector," a novelty wristwatch that makes a mooing sound when activated by the wearer. The phrase is thought to have surfaced sometime in 2008 as an image macro, featuring Zach Roloff[1] from the 2005 American reality TV series Little People, Big World and the caption "Say that to my face fucker not online and see what happens". The earliest archived use of the image dates back to a thread on 4chan's /a/ (anime) board on June 27th, 2008[2]. The Madden NFL series, formerly known as John Madden Football, is an American Football video game series developed by Electronic Arts Tiburon[3] that started in 1988. Prior to 1998, John Madden himself was only featured on the cover of each yearly installment of the series. In 1998, John Madden would again be on the cover of Madden NFL 99. However, in the PAL version of the game, San Francisco 49ers' running back, Garrison Hearst made the cover. After having the best year in his professional career and breaking several franchise records[4], Hearst twisted his ankle in the Divisional round of the NFL Playoffs against the Atlanta Falcons.  In 1993 artist Nina Katchadourian[2] began a photography project titled "Sorted Books"[1] that involved stacking books in a particular order in order to create a sentence or story. A collection of her sorted book photographs, titled Sorted Books,[3] was published by Chronicle Books on March 5th, 2013. The concept was first adapted to poetry in a post on an arts and crafts blog called buildmakecraftbake[4] titled "Book Spine Poetry" published on February 11th, 2009. On April 4th, 2014, Redditor KillerKenyan posted a photograph of a child wearing Spongebob Squarepants pajamas to the /r/funny[1] subreddit, claiming that his friend’s mom mixed up "pajama day" with "picture day" at her son's school (shown below, left). In the comments section of the post, Redditor CastleRuler[2] posted a photoshopped version of the 1930 American Gothic painting by Grant Wood superimposed with the faces of Pajama Kid and Side Eyeing Chloe (shown below, right). In the first 72 hours, the post gained over 54,700 up votes and 1,580 comments. The earliest known selfie featuring the #aftersex hashtag was posted to Instagram[1] by user arielchapaval on September 8th, 2013 (shown below). “Hail Hydra” is the salute used by the fictional terrorist organization of the Marvel Universe named Hydra and the opening line of the group's official motto, which reads: "Hail Hydra! Immortal Hydra! We shall never be destroyed! Cut off one limb and two more shall take its place! We serve the Supreme Hydra, as the world shall soon serve us!" It was first used by the organization’s members in the very same issue of Hydra's debut appearance, Strange Tales #135 published in August 1965, which also marked the introduction of S.H.I.E.L.D., the counter-terrorist organization nemesis of Hydra. On April 4th, 2014, the film Captain America: The Winter Soldier[1], part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise and sequel to Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), was released. In the film, Captain America discovers that S.H.I.E.L.D. had been infiltrated by Hydra decades ago. The scene parodied by this meme features the reveal to the audience that the character of Senator Stern (portrayed by Garry Shandling) is a Hydra member when he whispers to fellow agent Jasper Sitwell (portrayed by Maximiliano Hernández) the Hydra salute after a meeting. On April 6th, Twitter user Kevin M[2] tweeted out the first image macro, which shows Sesame Street character Ernie whispering "Hail Hydra," to Bert. #HailHydra #WinterSoldier #AgentsofSHIELD @clarkgregg @ChrisEvans @SamuelLJackson @MingNa @AgentsofSHIELD pic.twitter.com/Vv566wwDlvApril 6, 2014 The magical girl anime Ojamajo DoReMi[1] was produced by Toei Animations and premiered on Japanese TV stations on February 7th, 1999. The show's opening theme was written by future K-On! lyricist Shoko Omori[2], and performed by MAHO-Dou (MAHO堂), a group consisting of the show's voice actresses Chiemi Chiba, Tomoko Akiya, and Yuki Matsuoka. The song would be released as a single under the now-defunct music label Bandai Music Entertainment on March 5th, 1999. The well-crafted song would receive immediate praise after its release, where it would later be given the award for Best Theme Song at Animation Kobe[3] during 1999. The indexing of "words you must never search" (Japanese: 検索してはいけない言葉), or "keywords you must never Google" (Japanese: ググってはいけない言葉) on the Japanese web began as a compilation of individual threads discussing all sorts of NSFW content and shock sites on the anonymous text board community 2channel. While discussions of shock sites, gory media and computer viruses have occasionally taken place on 2channel's /news4vip/[1] board since late 2007, the first prototype list of "words you must never search" was started on 2channel's /occult/[2] (paranormal & spiritual phenomenon) board in January 2008 and continued to be updated until 2012. The meme originates from the closing scene of the show's season 4 premiere episode, "Two Swords"[1]. The episode was watched by 6.64 million people. This broke the viewership records for Game of Thrones and was HBO's highest ratings for any show since the finale episode of The Sopranos.[2] The episode closing scene featured the characters Sandor Clegane and Arya Stark asking for chickens in a tavern and eventually getting in a fight. The scene featured quotes like "Bring me one of those chickens" and "I understand that if any more words come pouring out your cunt mouth, I'm gonna have to eat every fucking chicken in this room." In the main campaign of Ground Zeroes, Kazuhira "Kaz" Miller (voiced by Robin Atkin Downes)[2] is introduced as second-in-command for the private military corporation Militaires Sans Frontières (MSF) who oversees his superior's mission while preparing its offshore stronghold (known as Mother Base) for an upcoming inspection from the United Nations. However, upon the completion of Big Boss' mission, the inspection is revealed to have been a Trojan Horse for a surprise attack on Mother Base, which catches the MSF soldiers off guard and sinks the base to the bottom of the ocean. Though he barely escapes with his life, Miller rendezvouses with Big Boss and tries to explain the situation, at which time he utters the aforementioned quote. Upon the game's release in March 2014, the quote, along with Downes's delivery of it, quickly gained notoriety for its obtuse placement in such a serious dialogue, soon giving rise to a series of online mockeries on Metal Gear fan forums. IGN columnist Lucy O'Brien criticized the game as being fraught with "gaudy dialogue,"[3], referencing the quote as an example. When later asked about the line in an interview, Downes joked that "You’re about to see some major music coming out of Kaz in the next game. Fiddling is just the beginning of it."[4]  On January 10th, 2012, an Anonymous 4chan [14] user posted a thread on /tv/ – Television & Film board, apologizing for his "poor English" and asking other users "when were you when heat legend dies", a misspelling of deceased actor Heath Ledger. On the same day, Body Building Forums [12] member HITSTICK53 posted a thread titled "when were you when heat legend dies?". On August 22nd, 2012, a version of the copypasta featuring the deceased Beatles musician John Lennon was posted to 4chan.[15] On November 24th, 2013, Beat by Dre released a commercial titled "Hear What You Want" in which professional basketball player Kevin Garnett dons a pair of Beats headphones to drown out the sound of fans of a rival team throwing taunts at him with the song "The Man" by Aloe Blacc playing in the background (shown below, left). On December 8th, the Beats by Dre YouTube channel uploaded a second "Hear What You Want" commercial, in which American football quarterback Colin Kaepernick uses a pair of Beats headphones to ignore insults by a mob of angry rivals (shown below, right). The hashtag was introduced by Chris Hardwick during a segment on his Comedy Central late-night show @midnight that aired on April 2nd, 2014. In the segment, Hardwick held a contest in which guests on the show were awarded points for listing movie titles with jokes about rear ends (shown below). On April 2nd, 2014, Dominican professional baseball player Bartolo Colón made his debut appearance in the MLB National League as the starting pitcher for the New York Mets in the team's second season match against the Washington Nationals. During his six-inning pitch on the mound, Colón allowed three runs on nine hits in a 5 – 1 loss to the Nationals. In addition to his pitching duties, Colón also had to step up to the batter's plate, a rule of the game that he has long been exempt from under the American League's "designated hitter" provision. In one of his chances at batting, Colón was seen on camera standing in an extremely slouched position, which soon caught the attention of Lana Berry[1] on Twitter: crying pic.twitter.com/ACr8AshskV On September 14th, 2013, Vine user Kevin Cartez[10] uploaded a Vine of the hip hop group WeAreToonz, who are credited with creating the dance, dancing the Nae Nae. As of March 2014, the Vine has gained over 40,000 likes and has been re-vined over 53,000 times. The dance is loosely based on the dance style of the character Sheneneh Jenkins from the 1990s comedy television show Martin[2]. The copypasta originated in February 28, 2011 on a thread[1] in the Bodybuilding.com forum[2] by someone who goes by the username, Tank107[3]. In the thread, Tank107, in broken English, says to be a very religious, presumably Christian, closet homosexual studying Fashion at an university in the United States. In his post, Tank107 describes his same-sex relationship with an American who is also studying Fashion and his guilt of being gay. Unable to take said guilt any longer, he called his mother in Russia and came out to her. Tank107 and his lover felt embarrassed about the experience and Tank107 still felt guilty about his homosexuality. Despite that, he continued his relationship with his American lover. "concon" was written by a Japanese composer S-C-U for jubeat knit APPEND released for Japanese arcades on March 23rd, 2011.[1] It was an expanded release of jubeat knit, the third title in the jubeat series launched in the previous year.

On March 20th, 2014, an image macro variation of the copypasta was posted by Facebook user Earl Dibbles Jr, which gained more than 283,100 shares and 241,000 likes in the first three weeks.  While little is known as of yet about the story behind the dance, Houston, Texas-based producer and video blogger Marquis Trill[5] has credited five individuals @1ballout_ @Thefuhkinmann @KronicCaviar @AXXXXJXY @JollyceM @SmashBro_KB as the creators of the Yeet. The earliest known video of someone performing the yeet dance was uploaded by YouTuber Milik Fullilove on February 12th, 2014 (shown below). In the HBO series Game of Thrones, which premiered on April 17th, 2011, Hodor is often shown in the company of the crippled boy Bran Stark and is only capable of speaking his own name.

It takes place in an alternate history, similar to other games like the Half-Life series. You play as “Jack”, an unwilling victim of a plane crash that stranded him near a lighthouse, which sent him to Rapture. Andrew Ryan is the game’s antagonist and creator of Rapture. After being sent by Atlas (actually Frank Fontaine) to Andrew Ryan’s office on a mission to kill him, it is revealed by Ryan that through the duration of the game, Atlas has been mind-controlling Jack using the phrase “Would you kindly?”. Realizing that Fontaine has the upper hand, Ryan then commands Jack to kill him with a golf club. Every time Jack strikes Andrew Ryan with the club, he repeats the phrase “a man chooses, a slave obeys!”, to show that he is dying of his own will. After killing Ryan, Atlas reveals himself to be Fontaine and shuts off Ryan’s systems, and releases splicers into Ryan’s office to finish off Jack. On March 19th, 2014, Brighton University student Lizzie Durley created the Facebook[2] page “Sellotape Selfie.” Durley explained to The Daily Mail[1] that she got the idea from a scene from the 2008 film Yes Man in which the character of Carl Allen, a bank loan officer played by Jim Carrey, wraps and distorts his face with clear tape as to avoid being recognized. The Facebook page gained over 50,000 likes within five hours.  The original comic was posted on the website for the Belgian magazine Humo[2] on October 20th, 2011.

Waluigi's first appearance in the Mario franchise was in the Nintendo 64 game Mario Tennis, released in 2000. He was created by Fumihide Aoki, with Shigeru Miyamoto being consulted with the design, because there were very few human characters in the series, and Wario needed a tennis partner for Doubles. He was designed to be the Luigi's rival in the way that Wario is to Mario, with exaggerated physical traits. Contrary to most people's belief that his name is just a poor offshoot from his partner in crime, Wario, his name actually comes from a pun based on "Warui", the Japanese word for Bad, and "Ruigi", since Japan substitutes the letter L for R, which makes his name literally "Bad Luigi". Waluigi's japanese name (ワルイージ, Waruīji) is also an anagram of ijiwaru, which in japanese can mean several things, such as mean-spirited, mean, nasty, vicious, cruel and ill-tempered.

While the song was initially met by Billboard success and critical acclaim, as years passed, the song eventually started to gain notoriety for its prevalence among young, beginner-level guitarists, who would frequently cover the song at parties and social gatherings to impress others. Although it is unclear exactly when "Wonderwall" first became known as a cliché, such notoriety of the song was noted by the band's lead singer-songwriter Noel Gallagher in an interview for the June 2002 issue of the Guitarist magazine, in which he recalled running across a sign in front of a guitar shop in Manchester that forbade people from playing the song.   "He's dead, Jim," is a popular catch phrase from the original Star Trek television series (infused into modern culture by its countless reruns) that is used as a pronouncement that something is no longer alive or working. Not only in a physiological way, but also in an mechanical, electrical, physical, or temporal sense not related to a biological system. As such, it has expanded from using the personal pronoun "he's" to the general non gender pronoun "it's" that might also could humorously describe some unspecified alien life form at the same time (and hence a joke), though Dr. McCoy was careful to assign gender when he said the phrase. It represents something that needs a formal pronouncement that only a kindly, yet firm and incorruptible country doctor could offer, as others stand around clueless, wondering what has happened or what needs to be done next. That, and the fact the viewer has no way of telling by themselves and need to be told outright. Most often seen with a comma after the "It's dead" it truly represents the slow delivery and dramatic pause, as he looks up, given by the actor DeForest Kelley, with a very serious tone of voice.

The lethal spell would turn Anna into a frozen statue if she does not receive a true love's kiss in time. Desperate and vulnerable, Anna turns to Hans hoping that his love could cure her of the spell. However, much to the surprise of her and the audience, Prince Hans reveals himself to be an opportunistic and power-hungry man who couldn't be further away from Elsa's ideal vision of true love.

Amidst all the disruptions and media commotions, a Japanese TV crew interviewed a young couple in front of Tokyo's Shibuya station. Upon being asked how they feel, the young man responded with an overly saccharine statement, which can be translated as "being in the snow with my lover like this immerses me in a special feeling. I like it" ("恋人といる時の雪って特別な気分に浸れて僕は好きです"). His response, which was seen by some viewers as laughably mawkish or sentimental, soon prompted an outpour of reactions on Twitter, especially after @HOMOMANKO[1] tweeted a screenshot of the interview clip (shown below). 黙れクソメガネ pic.twitter.com/KXJ1kP8zNF In the first few days, the tweet managed to gain more than 36,000 retweets and 15,000 favorites.

(phonetically: A nu chiki-briki i v damki! / "One, two – you're on top!"), a part nursery rhyme and a part idiomatic expression that translates to "Put a fucking bullet in his forehead," which is also referenced in a "Russian chanson" tune broadcast on the Bandits' radio transmission. The tune is loosely based on actual song called Хоп, мусорок (phonetically: "Hop, moosorok"; "Heyho, little cop") that gained memetic popularity in Russia around the time when S.T.A.L.K.E.R was released. According to a GameFAQs forums[1] discussion from September 2009, the term was coined on PlayStation 3's Metal Gear Online community as a corrupted way of telling a fellow player "get better."  On September 15th, 2013, an Imgur gallery of potoo photographs was submitted to the /r/funny subreddit, where it gained over 16,400 up votes and 500 comments in the first four months. Among the photos included a picture of a wall-eyed potoo (shown below, left). On January 25th, 2014, Redditor Robeast submitted an image macro of the potoo photograph confessing a desire to sleep in a pillow case titled "Introducing Weird Stuff I Do Potoo" to the /r/AdviceAnimals[2] subreddit (shown below, right). In the next 48 hours, the post received more than 19,100 up votes and 540 comments. The theme can be heard in the tutorial level of Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance[1] wherein the protagonist Raiden[2] is ambushed by Metal Gear RAY, a type of Unmanned Gears. The vocals kick in when Raiden initiates the finishing move on his enemy, which involves launching the machine upward before jumping on it and cutting off its arm, and the song returns for a reprise when he cuts off the other arm and bisects the Metal Gear. The first parody video utilizing the theme song was posted by YouTuber KazNDS on March 8th, 2013, which featured footage of an obese woman picking up and throwing a table and subsequently blocking and dodging chairs thrown at her during a riot (shown below, left). In homage to the original Guile's Theme Goes With Everything video[3], another YouTuber by the name of RulesOfNatureFitsAll juxtaposed footage of the Super Mario Brothers live-action film with the song on April 24th, 2013, utilizing "Soundtrack Dissonance"[4] in order to make the scene seem more engaging (shown below, right). The original instance of the image, which shows a Korean man holding a fire extinguisher as if it were a saxophone with the caption "Jazz for your soul," was uploaded in early 2007 by Daum blogger Masaru7 and began circulating the Korean blogs and forums, soon going viral after being featured in the HIT gallery of the Korean humor community DC Inside on April 24th. In 2010, the Internet humor television show Tosh.0 began airing public prank sketches called "surprise trust falls," in which host Daniel Tosh would approach people in public and fall into them while yelling the phrase "trust fall!" On January 27th, 2013, the Menswear Dog Tumblr[2] blog was launched, featuring photographs of Bodhi, a Shibu In dog wearing men's clothes (shown below). On January 23rd, 2014, New York Times Magazine editor David Joachim tweeted the cover for its upcoming January 26th issue, featuring Hillary Clinton’s face on the surface of a planet in space. Less than 15 minutes later, Twitter user Luke O’Neil replied to Joachim’s tweet joking that the Clinton planet looked like a “sentient space testicle.” Hillary Rodham Clinton, as you've never seen her, on the cover of this Sunday's NYT Magazine pic.twitter.com/QIsqibZaq5  The first known mashup video using the song was posted by a YouTuber Stalker Humanoid[4] titled "Kill la Eddie" on January 5th, 2014. The video contains a scene from television crime drama series Miami Vice[5] in which Eddie gets shot with a shotgun while "Don't lose your way" segment plays in the background, parodying how the song is used in Kill la Kill. On January 7th, a redditor defearl[6] posted a link to the video on Kill la Kill subreddit[7], coining and popularizing the phrase "Don't Lose Your Way Goes with Everything" among the anime community.  An idea of trapping fictional characters into something isn't so new thing. The bottle meme on the Japanese illustrators community pixiv is a famous example of this kind of illustration memes. The earliest known character art illustration tagged with "Tried to Confine" was submitted to pixiv by user Taste on June 21st, 2013.[2] The image featured a Vocaloid character Len Kagamine with his hands pressed against an invisible glass as if he is locked inside of the phone (shown below, left). However, this 2014 meme caused on Twitter by mainly Fujoshi or female otakus addicted to homosexual shipping, which was triggered by an illustration featuring Dio Brando from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (shown below, right). It was posted by Hz[3] on January 3rd, and had gathered over 5000 retweets and 4700 favorites within the first 24 hours. On March 23rd, 2011, Cracked[1] posted an image gallery titled, “If Movie Posters Were Honest.” The post featured Photoshopped parodies of posters for popular films, such as Jurassic Park, The Never Ending Story and Tron, many with their titles altered to highlight certain criticisms or disappointments surroudning the films, similar to the What I Watched, What I Expected, What I Got image macro series, while others had custom taglines poking fun at their premises in a nutshell. As of January 2014, the post has gained over 2.4 million views.    Urban Dictionary[4] user Donottouchthis submitted an entry for "fedora" on January 26th, 2008, which identified those who wore the hat as a "loser who is desperately seeking for a style to call their own." As of October 8th, 2012, the definition has received 109 up votes and 119 down votes. On November 27th, 2013, marketing professional Jackson Palmer posted a tweet that he would be "investing in Dogecoin." Investing in Dogecoin, pretty sure it’s the next big thing. http://t.co/yHR4bNv6OD In an interview with the tech news blog Motherboard,[4] Markus revealed that he wished to create a cryptocurrency that can reach a broader demographic than Bitcoin, which had previously come under accusations of funding illegal online activities like the Silk Road drug marketplace. After Palmer reached out to Markus on Twitter, the pair launched the official Dogecoin website along with the new cryptocurrency on December 6th, 2013. Dogecoin originally had a supply limit of 100 billion coins, which was removed in February 2014. On April 4th, 2012, the phrase was used in the /v/ (Video Games) board on 4chan[1] in a thread regarding white knight behavior. Online interest in beauty retouching hit its first peak when it was revealed the Dove Real Beauty Sketches had actually been retouched.[10] The revelation that the women in a campaign to promote body positivity and acceptance had their photos retouched lead to closer examinations of Photoshop culture by websites like Jezebel.[14] On September 29th, 2010, the Internet humor site Cracked[1] highlighted a video by the comedy duo Fatawesome, in which the music and vocals had been removed from the music video "Beat It" by Michael Jackson (shown below). The video featured added commentary by Fatawesome, which mocked the odd fight scenes in the film. Kanye was subsequent in coming up with another crazy meme this year. It was only a matter of time before he lost it and on Sway in the Morning he did just that. Due to his clothing line dropping him. He was enraged and ready to burst. Making the recognizable quote come about. It was later that fans and anti-fans alike ridiculed his behavior calling him "immature" or that "he's overreacting." Along with the meme he was viewed as presumptuous and misguided. Saying every time-line and famous company that came to mind. On July 2nd, 2011 the website gifsound.com[8] registered their domain name.[9] The website allows users to enter the URL of a GIF and the URL of a YouTube video to immediately pair them. On August 4th, 2009, Redditor prehack submitted a bait-and-switch confessional from the perspective of the titular character in the cartoon television series Scooby Doo to the /r/funny[1] subreddit. Prior to being archived, the post gained over 16,000 up votes and 820 comments. My job is so fucking unbelievable. I'll try to sum it up by first telling you about the folks I work with: First, there is this supermodel wanna-be chick. Yeah, okay, she is pretty hot, but damn is she completely useless. The girl is constantly fixing her hair or putting on makeup. She is extremely self-centered and has never once considered the needs or wants of anyone but herself. She is as dumb as a box of rocks, and I still find it surprising that she has enough brain power to continue to breathe. The next chick is completely the opposite. She might even be one of the smartest people on the planet. Her career opportunities are endless, and yet she is here with us. She is a zero on a scale of 1 to 10. I'm not sure she even showers, much less shaves her "womanly" parts. I think she might be a lesbian, because every time we drive by the hardware store, she moans like a cat in heat. But the jewel of the crowd has got to be the fucking stoner. And this guy is more than just your average pothead. In fact, he is baked before he comes to work, during work, and I'm sure after work. He probably hasn't been sober anytime in the last ten years, and he's only 22. He dresses like a beatnik throwback from the 1960's, and to make things worse, he brings his big fucking dog to work. Every fucking day I have to look at this huge Great Dane walk around half-stoned from the second-hand smoke. Hell, sometimes I even think it's trying to talk with its constant bellowing. Also, both of them are constantly hungry, requiring multiple stops to McDonalds and Burger King, every single fucking day. Anyway, I drive these fucktards around in my van and we solve mysteries and shit. On January 5th, 2014, Warframe forum user SWIXSAP created a General Discussions thread titled "How is booben Formed?" (a possible reference to the meme How is babby formed?) [1] attempting to ask where to find the parts for the Vauban warframe. While it is unknown whether or not his misspelling was an attempt at trolling, other users soon began poking fun at the user for their extremely broken English and repeated butchering of Vauban's name. After the original thread was locked for derailing, the following day on January 6th, a thread titled "The Booben Megathread" [2] was created, where users posted images of "Booben" and demanded the original thread be unlocked. On May 31st, 2010, YouTuber geminitech uploaded a video clip of the Final Jeopardy round on the television game show Jeopardy!, in which the contestant Jen McFann answers "What is Berkeley?" in response to a clue about the only United States city to share a name with an element from the periodic table (shown below). On January 8th, 2014, cartoonist Mike Rosenthal tweeted a photoshopped screenshot of the Jeopardy! clip with the answer "Who is Dankey Kang?" written as a response to a clue about the video game character Sonic the Hedgehog. Within the first week, the tweet gained over 1,300 retweets and 1,000 favorites. According to the Jeopardy! Archive,[4] the Sonic the Hedgehog clue has never been used on the game show. For Final Jeopardy: This Video Game character is blue, collects rings, and goes fast! pic.twitter.com/Dtk539MGeC Immediately after, Rosenthal tweeted another screenshot of a Jeopardy! contestant whose answer had been photoshopped to read "Who is Princess Zorldo," a misspelling of Princess Zelda from the Nintendo action-adventure game series Legend of Zelda. In early 2002, the website Heartless Bitches International published several pieces on the concept of the Nice Guy.[1] The sections delved into the common character traits of Nice Guys, what makes them undesirable to women, and tips on how they can make themselves more desirable. The sections were particularly critical towards self-professed Nice Guys whose "nice" behavior they saw as hypocrisy, emphasizing on stating that the Nice Guys themselves are the problem. The earliest known media mention of DiCaprio's lack of Oscars came from an article published on E! Online on February 21st, 2011 titled "Do Oscar Voters Really Hate Leonardo DiCaprio?"[3] The article examines possible explanations to why DiCaprio hasn't won a statue. On November 8th, 2011, Funny of Die[1] uploaded a video titled "L. DiCaprio," a parody trailer of DiCaprio's film J. Edgar. The trailer depicts DiCaprio in a state of rage endlessly pursuing an Oscar The Academy refuses to award him. On December 27th, 2013, a car bomb exploded in the busy central district of Beirut in Lebanon, killing six people and injuring at least 50 people. Among the victims of the attack were former aide to the Lebanese prime minister and opposition figure Mohamad Chatah, as well as a 16-year-old boy named Mohammad al-Chaar, who happened to be hanging with his friends near the site moments before the bomb went off. Shortly after al-Chaar was pronounced dead later that same day, a group selfie of al-Chaar and his friends taken right before the explosion and another picture of the bloodied aftermath began circulating on Twitter under the hashtag #RIPMohammadChaar (shown below).   Charles Bartholomew "Chuck" Bass is a fictional character in the Gossip Girl series of novels and the television series of the same name, in which he is portrayed by English actor Ed Westwick. Although he is a secondary, antagonistic character in the original book series, in the television series Chuck is portrayed as an anti-heroic character and is one of the main characters. The television series character is noted for his financial ambition, hedonistic lifestyle, and personal style. (Wiki) In the beginning of the series when Chuck is asked why he should be chosen to be an usher at an Ivy Week School Mixer he responds with "Why should I be chosen to be an usher?…. I'm Chuck Bass". As the series progresses this becomes his catchphrase and even other characters mention "He's Chuck Bass" as an explanation for his behavior (usually promiscuous).  The original photograph of the bear standing upright next to a police officer was featured in the print edition of St. John's daily newspaper The Telegram[7] on June 9th, 2011. According to the report, the photograph was taken at the Terra Nova National Park earlier that month when a bear cub suddenly appeared before the police officer, Const. Suzanne Bourque of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), as she was interviewing witnesses regarding the bear's reported encounters with the public. Although initial rumors by reporters said the bear was subsequently euthanized after being captured by the wildlife enforcement officers, in an interview[9] with the The Daily Dot on January 17th, 2014, Bourque stated that the RCMP was chasing two bear cubs and her corporal told her that the one they later euthanized wasn't the one shown in the photo. In November 2012, Tumblr user teamcocket[1] posted the photograph (shown above, right) with the caption reading "officer, come quick, there’s been a robbery." On January 6th, 2014, Tumblr user Typette[2] reblogged the photo saying it would be a great concept for a cartoon about a police officer and a bear cub going around solving crimes. On January 11th, Tumblr user Lemonteaflower[3] responded to Typette’s idea by reblogging the original post along with a concept image for the proposed cartoon (shown below, right), naming the duo “Miss Officer and Mr Truffles.” As of January 17th, the total post has gained over 170,000 notes.  On November 24th, 2013, actress Christina Ricci tweeted a photograph of herself squeezing into a dryer, proclaiming the image as part of her new photo series "I Can Fit in That!" Being small does have its benefits however. Look out for my new photo series, 'I Can Fit In That!'. pic.twitter.com/sM6HWY6ueD On November 26th, Ricci tweeted a photograph of herself inside of a refrigerator, gaining over 275 retweets and 680 favorites in the first two months. Yes, pants would have been more appropriate fitting-into-fridge attire. But, hey, I saw my opportunity and took it. pic.twitter.com/s3lhRg9Bg3 On April 6th, 2005, the German hip hop music site StopHipHop[12] posted a chat log from the #stophiphop IRC channel in which a user named “bitchchecker” enters the channel and threatens to hack another user named "Elch" for booting him, to which the latter responds by inviting him to attack the localhost[2] loopback IP address 127.0.0.1. Unaware of its consequences, Bitchchecker then ends up repeatedly crashing his own computer.  On January 12th, 2014, the American cable television channel E! livestreamed their red carpet coverage at the Golden Globe Awards in Beverly Hills, California. During the webcast, several popup-style “fun facts” were displayed in the bottom-left corner of the screen, including two particularly off-color factoids about the actors Michael J. Fox and Robert Redford (shown below).  Initially in a post about a Pride and Prejudice based marriage proposal, a user by the name of 'coldcockninja' prompted the idea, to which the original poster posted another set of images the same day, January 10th, 2014. On April 30th, 2013, photographer Daan de Vos uploaded a picture of a blue-colored tree frog (Leptopelis ulugurensis) to the photo-sharing site 500px[1] (shown below, left). On the same day, the photo was posted to the /r/aww[2] subreddit, where it gained over 4,300 up votes and 50 comments prior to being archived. On August 4th, Redditor grizzlyunicorn submitted the first image macro based on the photograph with a caption containing a frog-related pun to /r/AdviceAnimals[7] (shown below, right). On November 6th, Redditor Vacuitymechanica submitted another image macro to to /r/AdviceAnimals,[8] this time, with a caption claiming that the now-extinct mammoth animals were still alive when the pyramids in Egypt were built (shown below). The first time that Dieudonné made the gesture was in 2005 in his show "1905". During one the sketches, he talks about how the mammals are observing the humans and that dolphins are mocking us. He does the gesture to show how deeps the dolphins will screw us with their fins. Kanon was originally an adult visual romance novel released in 1999, following the exploits of a man named Yuichi Aizawa as he struggles with a form of amnesia. By meeting several woman, he slowly regains his memory. Since it's release, Kanon has sold over 300,000 units worldwide. An anime by the same name was released in 2006 by Kyoto Animation, which gained significant popularity due to its tie in with the web novel. The antecedent word "Wapanese" (as in Wannabe Japanese) was most likely introduced in the early 2000s, with the earliest instance on Google search dating back to the Racial Slur Database from June 30, 2002. Wapanese: a slur used to describe a white person who is obssesed with japanese culture. This would include manga/hentai/and anime. - The Racial Slur Database, 2002 From late 2003 and onwards, usage of Wapanese became alarmingly visible on 4chan, often leading to unpleasant exchanges between anime/manga fans and those who were far less interested in their subcultures. At the peak of its abuse in mid-2005, 4chan moderators devised a creative intervention using the word-filter, replacing every instance of Wapanese with "Weeaboo," which was a fictitious term originally coined by Nicholas Gurewitch in his Perry Bible Fellowship comic strip.[1] In its original context, the word "weeaboo" doesn't signify anything but something undesirable and deserving punishment. Since then, many 4chan visitors adopted the word "Weeaboo" in replacement of Wapanese.  On both Reddit and Imgur, users can cast an upvote or downvote for content and comments submitted to the site. On January 6th, 2011, Redditor SuriIllAnimateThat posted an animated GIF of a Reddit alien riding a narwhal through moving upvote arrows (shown below) to the /r/pics[2] subreddit.

As early as August 2013, an email message began circulating claiming that radioactive seepage had spread across the Pacific Ocean from the destroyed Fukushima nuclear power plant, accompanied by an image illustrating the trajectory of the radiation (shown below). On August 28th, a page titled "Fukushima Emergency" was created on the hoax debunking site Snopes,[3] which revealed that the image was actually a map of projected tsunami wave heights and not radiation spread. In September 2005, Starbucks enacted a new policy requiring baristas to write the names of customers on the side of their cups.[12] On May 13th, 2010, a Tumblr[1] blog titled "Starbucks Got My Name Wrong" was launched, which highlights photographs of misspelled names written on Starbucks cups (shown below). On February 26th, 2009, a Tumblr blog titled "Bikini Bridge" was launched, highlighting photographs of bikini bottoms stretched across women's hip bones (shown below). In the anime series Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam, which aired from 1985 to 1986, the character Amuro Ray asks Char Aznable[8] to explain why he has arrived, to which he responds that he came to “laugh at” him (shown below). On November 22nd, 2010, a captured image of Aznable with the subtitle "I came here to laugh at you" was posted to the /tg/ (Traditional Games) board on 4chan (shown below).[1] The exact origin of the phenomenon is unknown. The earliest available appreciation of the squat online comes from the /r/slavs_squatting,[4] which launched on November 29th, 2012. As of March 2021, the subreddit amassed more than 118,000 subscribers.   On October 22nd, 2013, the "PornHub Comments On Stock Photos" Tumblr blog was created by comedian Jason Mustian,[8] with the first post featuring a photograph of a tuxedo-wearing man seated at a laptop with a caption complimenting the quality of an adult film (shown below).

When a blind kitten sees it's first rainbow, you won't be able to hold back your tears.   In the 1994 movie Dumb and Dumber, the main protagonists were driving in a fleece covered automobile. One of the protagonists, the one to the left, asks if they want to hear the most annoying sound in the world. Then, he makes a loud screeching noise. The whole scene was unscripted.  The first instance of Hungaromém, using '60s Spider-Man, was uploaded to a Tumblr blog named TERMINÁL[1] by the user helloanevemb (literally "hellomynameisb") sometime in January 2013. The blog has since been deleted. This first image was made using Meme Generator's "Spider-Man Approves" template, having the caption "A csudálatos/Pauk-embör", which translates to "The Amazing Spider-Man" (referring to the official Hungarian title for the 2012 Spider-Man movie), written in a faux-rural grammar style. A stylistically similar English rendering would be something like "The Bewilderin' Cob-Lad". "Cleaning Levi" appeared in the scene where Levi and his Special Op Squad began cleaning the old recon corps headquarter that had been abandoned for a long time. This scene representing Levi's "clean freak" nature is included in the 20th episode printed in the volume 5 of comic book series (shown below, left), and the 15th episode in the TV anime series titled "Special Operations Squad: Prelude to the Counterattack, Part 2". It was aired on June 20th, 2013 (shown below, right). The original comic panel (shown below) was featured in the March 29th, 2009, issue of the webcomic series Horribleville, by KC Green, in which a passerby exclaims "Jesus Christ, how horrifying" in horror after confusing a fully grown man with a “fat ugly disgusting baby." The father of this head tilt is a Japanese anime director Akiyuki Shinbo.[2] His favorite posing, a character is overly tilting his/her head and suggestively looking down something over his/her shoulder, has been occasionally appeared on his works since before. Besides, this posing has been particularly struck by anime characters in Shaft productions because Shinbo has participated to most of Shaft's productions since 2004. The first instance of this posing which caught an attention among anime viewers is the extreme head tilt by Hitagi Senjougahara, a heroine of the original TV anime for the Monogatari Series Bakemonogatari, that was directed by Shinbo and produced by Shaft in 2009. The anime Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. 2nd GIG was originally aired 26 episodes on a PPV channel from January 2004 to January 2005. But it finally reached to large audiences by terrestrial channels' broadcasting from April to September of 2005. The song for the opening, "rise", was written by Japanese composer Yoko Kanno[2] who is also famous for her works in many anine/game franchises such as "Tank!" in Cowboy Bebop and "Interstellar Flight" in Macross Frontier. Meanwhile, the scene that later became to earn popularity appears at 0:57-0:58 in the movie, where members of Public Security Section 9 are standing out in a row against white background and each of them is looking in different directions. The original phrase was coined in "Ptolemy Private Academy ~ The Burning "Tntervention" Transfer Student: the Second Season" (私立トレミー学園 炎のKAINYU転校生 セカンドシーズン, Shiritsu Toremy Gakuen Honoo no Kainyu Tenkousei Second Season), a non-adult gag doujin comic for one of the incarnations in Gundam franchise Mobile Suit Gundam00.[1] It was released by a doujin circle OMEGA2-D at Comiket75 in December 2008. In the story, Marina Ismail[2], known as the "poverty princess" among fans, uttered this phrase when she was arrested by cultivating potatos in a public park and taken away to an interrogation room. This scene itself is also a parody for the original episode in the anime. Translation: "Humans are Nice" was composed for an ending theme song of the program by a famous Japanese composer Asei Kobayashi[2] and arranged by Joe Hisaishi[3], known as the main composer in Studio Ghibli's anime movies. And its innocent lyrics was written by Akari Yamaguchi.[4] This song was originally aired as the 5th ending theme of that program from 1984 to 1987 and earned a much popularity among viewers. Then it came back to the ending movie in 1990 and continued to be played till the program ended in 1994. Besides, the ending theme had been fixed to this song when the show was re-aired in 2000s. A song for 1992 movie The Bodyguard[2], "I will always love you", is one of the representative songs of Whitney. Her impressive long note in the climax part of the song is well known among many people in many countries. Japan is no exception, this song is often dubbed as "Endaaaaaah!" which comes from a phonetic transcription for the line in the climax part "And I (will always love you)". The first appearance of this pose, later called as "Gainax Pose", is a scene in the 4th episode of original animation video (OAV) Gunbuster[3] released by Gainax in 1988-89, where Gunbuster is standing with its arms crossed and coming up to deck of a space warship slowly in its first launch (shown, below, left). This robot's pose also appears on later episodes along with the protagonist's same pose with her face filled with strong determination against the battle for the future of the earth (shown below, right). As same as many other scenes and settings in the anime, this pose is also the homage to a panel in the 2nd title of Getter Robo[4] series, Getter Robo G[5], written by Ken ishikawa in 1975, where Getter Dragon standing on the head of a metal beast Uzala is coming up from under the sea with its arms crossed in the final battle.  "Platinum Disco" is the opening theme song for the "Tsukihi Phoenix" arc that aired 4 episodes from February 25th to March 17th of 2012. This song was written by Satoru Kōsaki[1] and sung by Yuka Iguchi[2], the voice actor for the heroine in this arc Tsukihi Araragi. The composer is also famous for his many works in The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, Lucky Star and The IDOLM@STER series, and also wrote "Renai Circulation" and "Hello Soybeans Song".   On November 13th, 2013, the Volvo Trucks YouTube channel uploaded a video titled "The Epic Split," in which two Volvo Globetrotter trucks are shown driving parallel in reverse while slowly separating for Van Damme to perform a split between them (shown below). In the first two months, the video gained over 61.4 million views and 37,600 comments. On May 2nd, 2013, freelance cinematographer Ryan Nethery launched a Tumblr blog titled "The Worst Room" as a place to catalog the terrible rooms for rent he had discovered on Craigslist while trying to find housing in New York City. The first post featured a photograph of a windowless room for rent in Williamsburg, Brooklyn for $850 (shown below). On November 20th, 2013, a fusion of the character Wendy from the animated TV series "Gravity Falls" and Frankie from the animated TV series "Foster's Home For Imaginary Friends" called "Wanky"[1] was posted on 4chan's /co/ (Comics & Cartoons) board (shown below, left). Shortly after, a chart was created featuring both characters with the addition of the character Vicky from the animated TV series "Fairly Oddparents" (shown below, right). On September 28th, 2005, the children's book and toy set titled The Elf on the Shelf: A Christmas Tradition was released, which tells the story of an elf who delivers reports regarding the behavior of children to Santa Claus each year. In 2008, 2009 and 2010, the doll won the Learning Express toy retailer's Best Toy Award. On November 28th, 2009, a Facebook[5] page titled "Elf on a Shelf Gone Bad" was launched, which highlights photographs of the Elf on a Shelf doll posed in a variety of violent, sexual and degenerate scenarios. Within the first five years, the page accumulated more than 111,000 likes. In the film Caddyshack, assistant greenskeeper Carl Spackler tells a story about receiving a blessing in lieu of a tip while caddying for the Dalai Lama, ending the anecdote with "So I got that goin' for me, which is nice" (shown below). On June 23rd, 2013, Redditor Thereminz submitted an image macro of Carl Spackler to the /r/AdviceAnimals[1] subreddit, which included a caption about losing his job and having dental work done with the saving grace of receiving a gift of Reddit gold (shown below). Within the first five months, the post gained over 7,300 up votes and 75 comments.  In the middle of 2008, the sound logo of "Salt of Hakata" became to a popular audio resource for MAD videos on NND, and Nico Nico Pedia's article for the salt made in June of that year had earned many voices from users in its comment board[1] which also had Oekaki[2] board system. Hakata-san was born in that board when anonymous users were confessing lewd imaginations for the salt in the beginning of 2009.[3] Translation: I want to lick Hakata-no-Shio-tan's salty pussy and melt it up. 71 ： Anonymous ：2009/01/26(Mon) 02:19:48 ID: Gv95C2/IzB Hakata-no-Shio-tan must be a little boy These 2 nonsensical comments inspired people's imagination to a gijinka character for the salt. Then on February 4th, a NND user ERsansuu (ER算数)[4] drew a rough illustration for "Shio-tan" on that Oekaki board, which was a character wearing on tricolore-colored Mexican hat and poncho, where the source for that solar salt was taken in that country. The TV program Kamen Rider Wizard was aired from September 2012, and the TV commercial movie for the transforming belt called "Wizardriver"[2] started to be aired in the end of August of that year (shown below). The feature of this rider belt is the "Spell Enchanter" speaker sings many phrases in too funky style when the player is holding transformation or magic rings over the belt. And the most remarkable phrase among them is "Shabba Doobie Touch Henshin!!" (Japanese: ｼｬﾊﾞﾄﾞｩﾋﾞﾀｯﾁﾍｰﾝｼｰﾝ!!) , a scat like a jazz player in the transformation sequence. "Linear Slope" was uploaded to both his official website[2] and video sharing services in December 2009. The former is daniwellP's original instrumental version, but the latter is a mashup version with Daft Punk's "Technologic". This mashup version was posted to the Japanese video sharing service Nico Nico Douga on December 13th, 2009[3], and it was officially reuploaded to YouTube by the creator in 2011 (shown below, left). Meanwhile, the first instance that introduced this song into MADs is "Onjouji Toki is "sickly" kawaii" (lit. Onjouji Toki is Sicky and Cute) made by NND user Kanban (看板)[4]. This video featuring Tok Onjouji, a sickly person in Japanese manga/TV anime Saki, was posted to NND on June 2nd, 2012 (shown below, right). Moero Spinner is a pilot version for Japanese yo-yo comic Chosoku Spinner (超速スピナー)[2], also known as English title Super Yo-Yo in the US. It serialized 2 episodes on a Japanese monthly boy comic magazine CoroCoro Comic in 1997, and included in both a yo-yo technical guide book "Hyper Yo-Yo Techniques" released in the same year and the 1st volume of Chosoku Spinner released in 1998. The frame is taken from a double-page spread where a young man called Kenichi Nakamura or Master Nakamura (中村名人; Nakamura Meijin), the national yo-yo champion in Japan who also appears on Chousoku Spinner, is demonstrating several yo-yo tricks to the protagonist boy. Master Nakamura is striking "Spider Baby" in a small frame on a corner of the pages. For Japanese viewers, this English name of this trick and his proud face with overmuch saturated linework on the background look very unfit to that too simple string trick without any dynamic movements because English names usually sound like grandiloquent to Japanese sensibilities. Therefore, this frame creates a weird atmosphere and causes surrealistic lulz to viewers. In this video game franchise running over decades, popular songs as a resource for online parodies are these comical battle theme songs in SNES era: "Battle 1" in Super Bomberman 2[2] (shown below, left) and "Extreme Chaos" in Super Bomberman 5[3] (shown below, right). Both songs were written by a Japanese video game composer Hirohiko Fukuda. The Best Assassin in the World (世界一腕の立つ殺し屋, Seaki Ichi Ude no Tatsu Koroshiya) is a nickname given to an assassin with no name who was hired to kill Haku Ron, the main character and a young boss of the largest mafia in Hong Kong. His nickname comes from a client's order "I want the best assassin you can get!". He became famous for the scenes in chapter 11 and 12, where he attempted to shoot Haku Ron in a park. The reason why he became to a laughingstock is his too original style for snipe: Mayu-tan's Kung Fu (まゆたんのカンフー; Matu-tan no Kanfuu) refers to a frame in chapter 42 where Haku Ron is explaining Kung Fu to younger brothers of Kurumi, the protagonist girl of this manga. Since this eccentric five motions not seemed at all to Kung Fu, it became to be considered as the creator's original martial arts called "Mayu-tan's Kung Fu". According to Nico Nico Pedia's article[1], the animated gif was made in Nijiura, the most aggressive boards in Futaba, for a troll who had continued making threads with the only one sentence "I want to die". Nijiura users made several ridiculously hilarious animated gifs to satirize the guy who apparently didn't had such mind. And, this psychedelic one shining like a garish neon sign (shown above) was one of those instances. Then, the video edition was created and uploaded to YouTube on April 19th, 2006[2], which played 1999 hit rave tune "Got the Groove" by German electro duo SM-Trax[3] in background. In the film, Buddy is disturbed to discover that a mall Santa Claus is actually just a man dressed in a costume. Believing that the man is trying to impersonate the Santa Claus he knows, Buddy reacts with disgust, whispering to the man "you sit on a throne of lies" (shown below). On June 1st, 2005, YTMND user Cryokenetic submitted a picture of Buddy paired with audio of the "You sit on a throne of lies" clip. Within the next eight years, the page received over 220,000 views, 170 comments and the audio clip was subsequently used on over 30 similar YTMNDs.[3][4] On June 15, 2012, Funnyjunk user evanggggg made a post titled "Adulthood Ruined" that featured a theory that adults don't appreciate the fruity shapes in the breakfast cereal Trix because 'Trix are for kids', which also happens to be the cereal's slogan. The post received over three thousand likes, and has 60,000+ views.   The argument arose in the comment section of a submission titled "Blindfold dildo prank…in da hood."[1] One of the residents of the area clearly gestures that he is going to punch the prankster and the incident appears in the video in the span of 2 or 3 seconds. User "Fartingsunshine" refers to the man drawing back to punch the prankster as a "violent degenerate" and is replied to by another user who insinuates that Fartingsunshine came to that conclusion due to the race of the person involved. A 2 day flamewar ensues with accusations of racism, and denials and assertions of the gestures exhibited in the video. The argument concludes with the following exchange. User fb95dd7063: I see a guy upset at being taunted and mocked on camera. In any case. I'm sorry (not really) that you think a white guy (me) is racist for saying "white people" We have reached an impasse and as a result anything else I post here is gonna be pasta. FartingSunshine: Your mother jerks off pigs. She gets down on her knees and crawls through the pigpiss mud slop and snuggles up to the pig, her fingers tracing along it's belly until she finds it's cock. She begins tugging and stroking as her twat moistens, her breasts swelling and her nipples begin to stick out like erasers on a fresh #2 pencil. She grunts with satisfaction as the pig begins eagerly thrusting into her hand, her grip now tightening to maintain control of the pig's greasy corkscrew cock. She lowers her head to watch the cock work in her hand, groans with satisfaction and begins working her clit with her other muddy hand, her hips gyrating with the rhythm of the pig's thrusting. "Oh fucking jesus god yes.." she gasps. She changes positions, still maintaining control of the feverishly thrusting cock as the pig's squealing intensifies. She leans forward and with her lips almost touching the pig's ear, she whispers your name and begins to shudder. She turns her attention again to the pigs swollen member rocking in her hand. She presses it between her hand and her face, the pig thrusting it against her cheeks as she drools. With a massive grunt and a high pitched squeal, the pig's balls explode, beginning a massive shower of hot, sour pig jizz. You mother cups one hand under the fountain of steaming genetic material gathering it in her hand as the thrusting comes to an end. The pig shudders and begins to walk to the trough of slop in the corner of it's pen, but your mother tackles it to the ground. She lifts it's tail and smears the handful of pig load into the pig's own fetid butthole, turning flakes of crusty pig shit into a pigshit-pigjizz mud slop on the pigs ass. Now she tilts her head to the sky and screams your name, not once, not twice, but three times. She slams her face full force into the pig's butthole and it's wreath of shitsemen pudding, her tongue machine gun flicking the rim and then burying itself to the hilt inside the pig's hot colon. Your mother works her tongue around the inside of the pigs ass, and then as a few incoherent syllables escaped her now brown lips, spurts of female ejaculate spurt from her pulsating cunt. Exhausted, she collapses in the mud, rolls over onto her back, and lights a cigarette. She takes one long drag, looks again to the sky, and speaks your name one last time before she drifts off to sleep. That's your mom. Your mom does that.  On December 4th, 2013, the eighth episode of American Horror Story: Coven aired on FX, which featured Madison Montgomery revealing to Fiona that she was resurrected from the dead in a previous episode. Upon returning, Madison confronts Fiona with the line "Surprise, Bitch. I bet you thought you saw the last of me." (shown below) On the following day, Tumblr user WhoreforChrist[6] submitted two GIFs captioned with Roberts' lines, receiving more than 243,000 notes within the first week. The song "I'm hungry" was uploaded to NND on February 2nd, 2010. Different from his previous works that featured UTAU or Vocaloids, this song, just repeating the phrase "I'm hungry", was sung by a female utaite[2] or NND singer Hachimitsu Inu (はちみつ犬; lit. Honey Dog).[3] And as same as his previous works "Get Down" and "Fukkireta", the video for this song is a simple loop animation made by the creator himself. The fart porn video, Farting Punishment, was released by a Japanese minor porn production company Fart FeTish Club (FTC) on August 18th, 2004.[1] In the story, a man looking like an American tried to steal a lady's pantie, but got found and subdued by ladies. Then he forces to smell their fresh farts for punishment. The well-known footage in this video is a part where a lady calling herself Lisa is straddling onto his face and mercilessly continues farting with refusing his pleading. A Lisa's remark in this scene, "Puri-Puri-Pu!", is a Japanese onomatopoeia for farting sounds. Transcript Xehpher is written by a Japanese composer Tatsuya Shimizu, the creator of another popular BEMANI song RED ZONE and better known as his alias Tatsh. This song was first included in beatmania IIDX 12 Happy Sky[1] released for the Japanese arcade in July 13th, 2005. As shown by its genre "MEDIEVAL CHOIR", the feature of this song is its solemn chorus sung by Japanese singers Junko Hirata and Tomomi Natori. This song has been also imported to other BEMANI titles: DanceDanceRevolution SuperNOVA, Toy's March 2 and Sound VOLTEX. Creepyparka, a portmanteau of borrowed English words "Creeper" (クリーパー; Kurīpā) and "parka," (パーカー; Pākā), was first visualized as a concept design and uploaded by Japanese illustrator 221 to Pixiv[1] on April 9th, 2011 and Nico Nico Seiga[2] on April 18th. The TV anime series aired 12 episodes from January to March of 2013. And "Mori! Mori!" appeared in the 2nd episode, where people were training at a Karate Dojo run by the parents of the protagonist's classmate called Moritani. This weird exercise which isn't seem at all to a karate training is a homage to the original manga. In the anime, Moritani family's business has been changed from a new religious group to a karate dojo for various reasons. And, the original "Mori! Mori!" posing in the manga was that religious group's solicitation poster in past (shown, below, left) and its catch copy was "Mori Mori Hairou Moritani-kyo!!" (モリモリ入ろう 森谷教!!, lit. "Let's heartily join onto Moritani group!!"). This ridiculous posing in the solicitation poster was also parodied into the dojo's poster in the 5th episode (shown below, right). The music video for "Heavenly Star" was uploaded to NND not only by a user in July 2007[5], but also by the official in November of that year[6] as the part of a partnership campaign of NND and Japanese recording company AVEX, NND's largest stockholder where Genki Rockets had been belonged to in those days. And the phonetic translation line "Shining Spiral Shit" had been mentioned in both of videos in before, but it was a minor in-joke. On June 10th, 2008. NND's daily popular video chart occurred a glitch of displaying video rankings not by popularity but by alphabetical order of video's ID.[7] In this accident, top 100 in the chart were hijacked by AVEX's official videos since those were given IDs beginning from "ax", different from that of usual NND videos beginning from "sm" or "nm". And becausee the video ranked into the 1st place by this glitch was "Heavenly Star", it forced to become the target of criticism against the glitch, and drew much negative attention. Meanwhile, it also made many NND users be inspired by that silly one liner. Then they quickly created the complete version of funny phonetic translation lyrics on the floating comments of the video on the same day. Editor's Note: NND's video which was given the phonetic translation lyrics is edited version into 2 and a half minutes. So the lyrics for the latter part doesn't exist. Via: LetsSingIt[8] (Original lyrics) and Nico Nico Pedia[9] (Japanese lyrics) Interpretation This game was a game announced in 2008, and developed by Deep Silver. The game was cancelled in 2009 but wasn't cancelled in 2013. It was originally going to be a open-world game, but the developers closed down but they werent, rebuilding the game without the open world and being split into other titles for all gaming platforms.  "Big Blue" first appears as the second course of the original F-Zero released in 1990. Its theme song, "Decide in the Eyes" written by Japanese game composer Naoto Ishida, is one of the most famous tunes representing this video game series, and its arranged versions have continued to be included in almost all of subsequent F-Zero series. This stage and the song also have made guest appearances with Captain Falcon, the main character in the series, in Super Smash Brothers series and 2012 game Nintendo Land.[2] On December 10th, 2013, Redditor Beerdrummer submitted a post titled "My wife looked like a 60 year old woman as a child" to the /r/funny[1] subreddit, featuring a photograph of a young girl with a short haircut and large eyeglasses (shown below). In the first 48 hours, the post received over 23,800 up votes and 940 comments. After The Avengers were released pictures on the internet circulated (commonly as Reactions to Hostile, Violent or Troll Comments) Especially on Tumblr and rarely Reddit. Eventually Scenes from Other Movies and Television Shows (such as Supernatural) The first appearance of "Kill Me Dance" was on the first comic book cover's backside which was released in January 2009. It shows 16 "discontinuous" movements with the caption "Let's make a flipbook by clipping each panels and sorting them along the numbers! Make an anime by yourself!". Then, the TV anime series for this manga aired from January to March of 2012 visualized this joke into the real dance in the ending movie with the theme song "The True Secrets of the Pair's Feelings" (ふたりのきもちのほんとのひみつ Futari no Kimochi no Honto no Himitsu) sung by voice actors Mutsumi Tamura[2] and Chinatsu Akasaki.[3] On December 1st, 2013, the Amazon Prime Air drone-based delivery system was announced by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos on the American television news program 60 Minutes as a service in development which can ship any product weighing five pounds or less to a customer within a 10 mile radius in less than 30 minutes. The same day, the online retailer released a promotional video featuring a drone test flight on YouTube (shown below). In the first 72 hours, the video gained over 7.9 million views and 6,800 comments. On November 28th, 2013, Elan Gale, a producer for ABC's reality dating show The Bachelor, began tweeting[1] about a rowdy passenger on his homebound flight: Our flight is delayed. A woman on here is very upset because she has Thanksgiving plans. She is the only one obviously. Praying for her According to Gale's account, he then "sent her" a glass of wine with a handwritten note criticizing her for being self-centered and causing nuance to others, triggering a back-and-forth exchange of passive-aggressive remarks between them (shown below, from left to right). To which Gale then responded: After the plane landed in Phoenix, Arizona, Gale tweeted that the woman on the flight came up to him and slapped him, almost prompting an agent at the gate to call the police, to which he responded by handing her a final note to inform that their in-flight exchange had gone viral on Twitter. Well, "Diane" just slapped me wip The origin for the saying "Cry Me a River" was in 1955 when the popular song "Cry Me a River" was sung by Julie London, and then Ella Fitzgerald. It gained internet notability around April 23, 2003 when it was submitted to Urban Dictionary. The original photoshopped parody of the Donkey Kong 64[4] box art was seen as early as October 8th, 2012 in a thread on 4chan's /v/ (Video Games)[1] board. The image shows a digitally composited caption that consists of the words "Expand" and "Dong" cut out from the box art for the 1999 Nintendo 64 platformer game Donkey Kong 64.  Live-tweeting has its roots in the news media coverage of current events, one of the earliest examples being the CNN and Facebook's joint "live-tweet" coverage[1] during inauguration of Barack Obama in January 2009. The visual novel Little Busters! was originally released for Windows in Japan on July 27th, 2007 and with several other editions being released in later years. The opening credits were made in a typical style for visual novels, by showcasing the main cast's character illustrations along with it's theme song. The credits have been published as a trailer several months before the release date. A year later, the adult version of the game, Little Busters! Ecstasy, was released in Japan on July 25th, 2008 and with it's opening being shared online as early as May of that year. The remark "Balsamic Vinegar" is uttered by Tsukasa in the 5th episode of the TV anime aired in May, 2007. In the scene, she got addicted to the feeling of the phrase from a TV informercial which was strangely emphasising "Su"'s accent, and uttered it repeatedly to enjoy its sound. Kaori Fukuhara[1], the voice actor for Tsukasa, revealed that scene was an ad-lib of her in an interview uploaded to the official information page for Lucky Star in June of that year.[2] The phrase is taken from the 4th chapter of the manga where Shigeru Shikishima talked with Neri Oishi, the protagonist convincing herself that the traffic death of her older sister was caused by the sister's teammates in a high school volleyball club (shown below, left). That childhood friend of her said this phrase to expostulate with her who had that unjustified resentment based on misunderstanding and refused to face to the truth. The comic book including this episode was released in 2006. Meanwhile, the original of Yuno's smile picture is taken from the 1st episode in TV anime Hidamari Sketch aired in 2007 (shown below, right). This is a funsub and there are no proper translations for this phrase because official English version for the manga hasn't released. Other English translations found on the web are "If you think so, You could to Yourself" and "If you think so, it must be so." You the Rock★ derived the word "Dynamo Feeling" to agitate audiences in Nona Reeves's in-store live show at Tower Records Shibuya on October 3rd, 2000. As he joined to their tune "DJ DJ ~ Todokanu Omoi" (lit. DJ DJ ~ I'll never break your heart) released in the previous month, he had a guest appearance on the stage. Nona Reeves played this song and "Love Together" in this 10-minute session, and it was live-broadcasted by Japanese music pay channel Space Shower TV (SSTV). Translation (from 00:25-): Video clips recoreded that program were uploaded to YouTube by pure music fans in 2009 and 2011. Then these were imported to NND by Inmufags in November 2010[3] and August 2011.[4] This is because Nishidera has earned a cult following among Inmufags who believe he has a close resemblance to Yajuu Senpai (野獣先輩, lit. Beastly Senoir, abbr. YJSNPI), their most favorite gay porn actor in the A Midsummer Night's Lewd Dream series since before. Inmufags call him by an acronym "NSDR" and like to collect his videos to their homeground. Figu@Mate was released on November 24th, 2006, and its opening movie including the theme song "Gacha-Gacha Cute Figu@Mate" (ガチャガチャきゅ〜と・ふぃぎゅ@メイト) was uploaded to the official product page for promotion.[3] This song was composed and performed by Mosaic.wav[4], a Japanese moe-pop band well-known for its many dempa song works from the rise of the scene in the first half of 2000s.  "Cyclops Senpai" comes from a Japanese gay porn "Scooop!!! 1 – Virtual Sex – Meet the Team!!!" (Scooop!!! 第一弾 virtual sex-イカせ隊・見参!!!) which was released by COAT Corporation on May 20th, 2001. The remarkable feature in this video is its quite weird opening scene where a guy with silver body painting is wearing a black head-mounted display and connecting to a virtual sex machine. This opening scene is colored by 1999 hit tune “Sandstorm” by a Finnish trance music producer/DJ Darude. And, this silver guy, the protagonist in this video, is the same actor as Yajuu Senpai who appeared in the 4th chapter of A Midsummer Night's Lewd Dream, the most famous Japanese gay porn video released by the same production in that year. Transcript  In 2006, official music track It Burns! Burns! Burns! was released on iTunes by eyedentity records.[2] On October 13, 2008 the animation studio Animalada uploaded the new episode of the Don't Bother me Mosquito animated series.

On December 20th, 2009, firefighters attempted to resuscitate Murphy after she was found unconscious in her bathroom in Los Angeles, California. She was subsequently brought to the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and pronounced dead after going into cardiac arrest. On February 4th, 2010, a report from the Los Angeles County coroner determined that the cause of death was pneumonia, iron-deficiency anemia and drug intoxication. Later that month, the coroner released additional information, claiming that Murphy had elevated levels of several prescription medications. On May 23rd, Murphy's husband Simon Monjack was found dead at the same home. The following month, the Los Angeles Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter reaffirmed that the death was caused by pneumonia and anemia and that there was “no indicators that it was from mold” as some had speculated.

The original post has since been removed from n4ughtybear's blog. The Tumblr blog Selfies at Funeral[1] was launched on October 28th, 2013 by Fast Company's senior editor Jason Feifer[3], who had previously experimented with a similar concept through Selfies At Serious Places[2], which highlights various selfies taken in inappropriate places and/or circumstances. In the episode Phineas and Ferb Musical Cliptastic Countdown which was aired on October 12, 2009[1], Doctor Doofenshmirtz plays a video that he scientifically created to get stuck inside people's heads to hypnotize them into his bidding[2]. Perry the platypus manages to stop the video but not before all of the audience members getting hypnotized. While it remains unclear when or where the copypasta originated from, the earliest known instance was posted by Twitter user @asprosphere on August 18th, 2013. In the following months, the offensive joke slowly began spreading across the microblogging network with several dozens of retweets. While some dogs are born with eyebrow-like colorization, the fashion trend for pet dogs originated from East Asia in the early 2000s, as evidenced in an article published by the Chinese news site TVBS in March 2004 and a forum post submitted to the South Korean humor forum Bittalk on in October that year (shown below). In August of 2011, a "Scumbag Parents" page was created on the image macro generator website Quickmeme.[6] The earliest featured instance was submitted on August 29th, which complained about parents demanding a room be cleaned for visiting relatives (shown below).  Adobe Photoshop has included Content Aware Scaling as a tool since the release of Photoshop CS4 on October 15th, 2008. The main principle of content aware scaling is applying an algorthm to an image to detect paths of least importance. This paths can be deleted or added to change the image size without changing the important parts.[1] On August 21st, 2007, Youtuber and businessman Siim Teller uploaded a demo video offering a step-by-step instruction of the process. On November 4th, 2013, comedian Patton Oswalt introduced the hashtag in a tweet with an intentional typo substituting the word “dong” for “dog.” In just over 24 hours, the tweet gathered over 630 favorites and 450 retweets.

The diarrhea medicine brand Imodium has produced several advertisements with the slogan "Where will you be when your diarrhea comes back?" in the mid to late 2000s. On January 22nd, 2008, YouTuber Dairenn Lombard uploaded an Imodium ad featuring a woman dancing with a man in a record store who is suddenly struck with diarrhea (shown below).   On October 22nd, 2013, Swedish balloon artist and blogger Katja Wulff launched the single topic blog Meowfit of The Day[1] to share photographs of her 16-year-old Siamese cat Gucci dressed in stuffed leggings. According to Wulff's interview with The Metro[11], the idea came about randomly as Wulff and her boyfriend Dan tried to come up with a new prank to play on their cat. The phrase is said to have been inspired by an aerial photograph of an isolated storm taken during a flight between Washington and Arizona, which was submitted to /r/Pics by Redditor zaikman, a friend of the photographer, on September 3rd, 2009. In the following years, the photo was reposted to Reddit twice more, in January 2010[2] and February 2011,[3] before phrases similar to “fuck this specific area” began appearing in the comments. The phrase became popularized through the 1990s PBS science educational program Bill Nye the Science Guy[1] in a recurring feature segment called "Consider the Following," in which Bill Nye presents a series of scientific facts on a particular subject or topic. The earliest known colloquial use of the phrase on 4chan can be traced back to a reply comment in an /a/ (anime) board thread posted on July 18th, 2009. In the post, the commenter In Season 2 Episode 6 of How I Met Your Mother, the architecture firm owned by the protagonist Ted presents a design to which the client responds by saying "that's a penis" (shown below). On January 30th, 2011, Tumblr user brokentripod reportedly created the GIF. However, they posted the earliest available usage of the meme on February 3rd. The post received more than 154,000 notes in less than 10 years (shown below). One of the first known pieces of toast art was a rendition of The Mona Lisa (shown below) created by Japanese artist Tadahiko Ogawa[1] in 1983. The work was completed in two weeks using 63 slices of bread.[2] In 2013, Spiritual Teacher Eyang Subur was accused by Adi Bing Slamet and a number of celebrities for spreading heresy in his teachings. On March 25th, 2013, Arya Wiguna, one of Eyang Subur's former followers, released a statement in front of the press where he challenges his ex-mentor "for God's sake". On the same day, a video containing the statement was uploaded to Youtube by news site KapanLagi.com which gathered over 680.600 views within 3 years(shown below). On April 17th, 2013, Youtube user Calengklik uploaded one of the first remix videos titled Arya Wiguna – Demi Tuhan which uses clips from various movies with the Guile theme playing as background music. The video gathered over 2,7 million views within 3 years. The popularity of the remixes became the subject of news by a number of sites such as SoloPos,[2] Bingkai Berita,[3] CiriCara,[4] and KapanLagi.[5] The phrase was first used in a series of advertisements for the Force Factor bodybuilding supplement (shown below) that began appearing online as early as August 2011. The ads typically featured a man with prominent upper body muscles accompanied by a paragraph claiming that "Cambridge scientists" had discovered a powerful new muscle-building supplement. On October 26th, 2013, New Zealander vlogger Andrew Strugnell[1] uploaded a video titled “The Great Giraffe Challenge (Facebook Riddle)." In the video, he offers up a riddle about having a surprise breakfast with one's parents at 3 a.m. and requests the viewers to message him on Facebook[2] with the correct answer. Strugnell also adds that if the answer is incorrect, then the challenger must change the profile picture to a giraffe for three days. The video gained more than 55,000 views in the first 48 hours. Here is the riddle: 3:00 am, the doorbell rings and you wake up. Unexpected visitors, It’s your parents and they are there for breakfast. You have strawberry jam, honey, wine, bread and cheese. What is the first thing you open? The original image was titled "Jake_and_Maribelle" and was uploaded to Deviantart by user TDIGURL12. The image has since been removed from the site and the account deactivated, but the image continues to resurface throughout the Internet.  The origin soundtrack is made by the artist Kenet & Rez.  Honchkrow first appeared in the first Pokémon games of the 4th Generation: Pokémon Diamond and Pokémon Pearl versions, though it's exclusive to Pokémon Diamond. The use of Honchkrow as a meme started in 2012, when an Anonymous poster from 4chan's Pokémon board, /vp/, posted a thread with a picture of Honchkrow and said "Honchkrow is weak to Machamp". After said thread was posted, the /vp/ users started to express their hate for Honchkrow in various ways such as going insane. On August 2nd, 2010, DeviantArtist[3] littleliesel uploaded an image showcasing a zombie apocalypse team made up of eight different characters from animated television shows and video games (shown below). The post cited a deleted Tumblr[4] post as the origin of the template image.

On April 6th, 2012, Redditor blue_tidal submitted a story titled “The Smiling Man” to the /r/LetsNotMeet[1] subreddit, a community for sharing stories about creepy encounters in real-life, which recounted a tale about being stalked by a tall, smiling man while walking down a sidewalk in an undisclosed “major city in the U.S.” Prior to being archived, the post gained over 1,300 up votes and 170 comments. "About five years ago I lived downtown in a major city in the US. I've always been a night person, so I would often find myself bored after my roommate, who was decidedly not a night person, went to sleep. To pass the time, I used to go for long walks and spend the time thinking." I spent four years like that, walking alone at night, and never once had a reason to feel afraid. I always used to joke with my roommate that even the drug dealers in the city were polite. But all of that changed in just a few minutes of one evening. It was a Wednesday, somewhere between one and two in the morning, and I was walking near a police patrolled park quite a ways from my apartment. It was a quiet night, even for a week night, with very little traffic and almost no one on foot. The park, as it was most nights, was completely empty. I turned down a short side street in order to loop back to my apartment when I first noticed him. At the far end of the street, on my side, was the silhouette of a man, dancing. It was a strange dance, similar to a waltz, but he finished each "box" with an odd forward stride. I guess you could say he was dance-walking, headed straight for me. Deciding he was probably drunk, I stepped as close as I could to the road to give him the majority of the sidewalk to pass me by. The closer he got, the more I realized how gracefully he was moving. He was very tall and lanky, and wearing an old suit. He danced closer still, until I could make out his face. His eyes were open wide and wild, head tilted back slightly, looking off at the sky. His mouth was formed in a painfully wide cartoon of a smile. Between the eyes and the smile, I decided to cross the street before he danced any closer. I took my eyes off of him to cross the empty street. As I reached the other side, I glanced back… and then stopped dead in my tracks. He had stopped dancing and was standing with one foot in the street, perfectly parallel to me. He was facing me but still looking skyward. Smile still wide on his lips. I was completely and utterly unnerved by this. I started walking again, but kept my eyes on the man. He didn't move. Once I had put about half a block between us, I turned away from him for a moment to watch the sidewalk in front of me. The street and sidewalk ahead of me were completely empty. Still unnerved, I looked back to where he had been standing to find him gone. For the briefest of moments I felt relieved, until I noticed him. He had crossed the street, and was now slightly crouched down. I couldn't tell for sure due to the distance and the shadows, but I was certain he was facing me. I had looked away from him for no more than 10 seconds, so it was clear that he had moved fast. I was so shocked that I stood there for some time, staring at him. And then he started moving toward me again. He took giant, exaggerated tip toed steps, as if he were a cartoon character sneaking up on someone. Except he was moving very, very quickly. I'd like to say at this point I ran away or pulled out my pepper spray or my cellphone or anything at all, but I didn't. I just stood there, completely frozen as the smiling man crept toward me. And then he stopped again, about a car length away from me. Still smiling his smile, still looking to the sky. When I finally found my voice, I blurted out the first thing that came to mind. What I meant to ask was, "What the fuck do you want?!" in an angry, commanding tone. What came out was a whimper, "What the fuu…?" Regardless of whether or not humans can smell fear, they can certainly hear it. I heard it in my own voice, and that only made me more afraid. But he didn't react to it at all. He just stood there, smiling. And then, after what felt like forever, he turned around, very slowly, and started dance-walking away. Just like that. Not wanting to turn my back to him again, I just watched him go, until he was far enough away to almost be out of sight. And then I realized something. He wasn't moving away anymore, nor was he dancing. I watched in horror as the distant shape of him grew larger and larger. He was coming back my way. And this time he was running. I ran too. I ran until I was off of the side road and back onto a better lit road with sparse traffic. Looking behind me then, he was nowhere to be found. The rest of the way home, I kept glancing over my shoulder, always expecting to see his stupid smile, but he was never there. I lived in that city for six months after that night, and I never went out for another walk. There was something about his face that always haunted me. He didn't look drunk, he didn't look high. He looked completely and utterly insane. And that's a very, very scary thing to see. On April 30th, 2013, a user named Eddie uploaded a video. On Newgrounds, a user named “eddie998” uploaded an image. http://eddie998.newgrounds.com/news/post/871596 On October 24th, 2013, Redditor j0brien submitted an image macro complimenting a woman's body with a wordplay on F5, a function key that serves as a shortcut command for reloading a webpage, in an /r/AdviceAnimals[1] post titled “Introducing: Overly Suave IT Guy" (shown below). In the first 24 hours, the post gained over 28,100 up votes and 690 comments.  The earliest known use of the phrase "RIP in peace" was posted in a thread titled "RIP in Peace Shane Cross" by Newgrounds Forums[3] member Glue-Sniffer on May 12th, 2007, which lamented the death of professional skateboarder Shane Cross. The phrase "nightmare fuel" used in this manner was first uttered in episode 521[1] of Mystery Science Theater 3000, which originally aired on December 24th, 1993. While watching the film "Santa Claus," Crow T. Robot sees an animatronic Santa that causes him to exclaim "That's some good old-fashioned nightmare fuel."

According to the profile description, the man is searching for a female aged 16-20 years old to live with him in Saint-Petersburg, Russia. As early as February 2013, the trend took off in Japan as "チュン顔" or "ちゅん顔 ," which translates to chun-gao or "chirp face." On February 5th, 2013, Fashionsnap.com[1] noted the slightly agape smile was popular in the Japanese fashion magazine AneCan, comparing the look to to Duck Face and “てへぺろ,” , a Japanese photo fad that involves sticking one's tongue out to the side of the mouth. Six days later, similar selfies began appearing on Instagram under the hashtag “ちゅん顔” (shown below). As early as October 3rd, 2013, in-game screenshots and various details about Goomy began circulating on the Smogon forums[2], 4chan’s /vp/[3] (Pokemon) image board and the /r/Pokemon[4]subreddit, where they were universally met by positive responses from the fans. On March 10th, 2011, the blog “Sad Etsy Boyfriends” was launched on Tumblr[2] with several photographs of men wearing hand-knit beanie caps taken from Etsy product pages (shown below). The quote originally appeared in a multi-pane webcomic depicting "Weepinduo," a hybrid Pokémon Fusion character made from Weepinbell and Doduo, created by Tumblr user ohcorny[1] on May 19th, 2013 (shown below). As of October 19th, the original post has accumulated more than 120,000 notes on Tumblr. In the comic, the two-headed creature is depicted as a pair of siblings learning to cope with their apparent physical deformity, with one asking the other "do you love me brother," to which the latter determinedly responds "be strong Clarence, be strong for mother" in internal monologue. The nature of the webcomic dialogue has been compared to another vertical multi-pane image featuring two brothers from the 2011 BeyBlades eBay Auction, though it remains unclear whether the phrase "be strong, Clarence" was directly inspired by the instance (shown below). Nightmares Fear Factory established their first website, nightmares-niagra.com in October 1998. As early as July 2002[2], the site has hosted a gallery of candid photos (shown below) taken inside the attraction as people are walking through.

Originally created as a character in the h-manga, Yotsunoha Legs, she would come to later fame when an edited version of the manga was uploaded to 4chan's /V/[3] board which replaced all sexual situations with images of both an NES and a cartridge of Battletoads. On August 14, 2013, the first page of the edited manga was posted in Know Your Meme's Hentai Quotes gallery by user Habanero-tan. In the following days the rest of the manga would be uploaded by users synge (formerly ImmaHeMan) and Baron O Beefdip (formerly SirBrownBear). Each new post garnered comments which generally expressed shock and disgust with the manga, yet at the same time, excitement over the idea of a community adventure that all had been able to take a part in. Approximately one month later user ImmaHeMan tried to garner the same response by posting an image from an Attack on Titan doujin. This caught the attention of several users, most notably Deustodo and That Glaceon (formerly Deltamelon).

Throughout the 1990s, the spots were parodied on other television shows[3], most notably on Late Night with Conan O’Brien (shown below, right) and Family Guy.  As early as June 2000, Houston, Texas-based artist Bill Davenport[1] had been making sculptures from objects housed in crocheted yarn objects, which were likened to tea cozies[2], a cloth or knitted cover used to insulate a teapot. This idea spread to Portland, Oregon by 2002 when artist Shanon Schollian[3] debuted the Stump Cozy Project, in which a group of knitters covered tree stumps in yarn. However, the term "yarn bombing" was not coined until October 2005 when Houston artist Magda Sayeg[4] created the group Knitta Please[5] (shown below), whose mission is to make "warm and fuzzy" street art.

Downvotes here I come, because I guess I'm going to be the only one to stick up for that poor Uruk-hai. He looks nothing like that hideous monster." In response, Redditor jun2san commented "Ahhhh, the old reddit switch-a-roo." The comment was later edited to link to a rage comic explaining the history of the switch-a-roo (shown below) and was later edited again to link to the music video for the song "Never Going to Give You Up" by Rick Astley.

On October 15th, 2009, Flickr[1] user Mike Woodridge uploaded a photo of a Halloween sign with the word "Spoopy" written in a skeleton-style font (shown below). The quote is taken from a scene in Mean Girls wherein the antagonist Regina George (played by Rachel McAdams) drives up to the protagonist Cady Heron (played by Lindsay Lohan) in a sports convertible car and yells “Get in loser! We’re going shopping” (shown below).

On April 8th, the day before the shutdown would go into effect, Virginia-based Twitter user delrayser tweeted out one of the earliest instances of hashtag as #GvtShutdownPickUpLines, referencing how a shutdown would leave workers deemed “nonessential” without a job and pay for its duration with a pick up line declaring the only nonessential aspect of the person to be their pants. The tweet was retweeted more than 400 times and was copied by the D.C. culture blog Famous D.C.[19] approximately an hour and a half later. Baby, the only thing that's "nonessential" about you is those pants. #govtshutdownpickuplines  On October 2nd, 2013, Redditor theguysspot submitted an image macro of a woman standing with outstretched arms in the middle of a street in a /r/funny[2] post titled “Just ran into this woman at the local red light” (shown below).

The earliest known use of the phrase “you think this is a fucking game?” can be found in the first verse of hip hop artist DMX's 1999 hardcore rap song “What’s My Name?” (shown below). As early as in July 2010, the phrase began appearing in disapproving reaction images of Starecat on the imageboard 4chan. While the exact origin of the Starecat image macro is unknown (shown below, right), its earliest known instance can be found in an article published by the cricket video game enthusiast blog Gamers Cricket[1] on August 4th, 2010. According to a thread Facepunch forum member Seed Eater, the abbreviation "2Spooky" was inspired by the creepypastas "And Then a Skeleton Popped Out" and "Mr. Bones Wild Ride" from the /x/ (paranormal) board on 4chan. Forum members began making using the term "2SPoOkY4U" after forum member Mr. Royzo posted the song "Spooky, Scary Skeletons." Episodes centered around the use of polygraph tests have been a recurring theme on the Maury show, where guests agree to the lie detector test to support or contest various claims (shown below). On October 2nd, 2012, a page titled "Maury Povich LOL" was created on the image macro website Meme Generator,[1] featuring an image of Maury Povich reading off a card while seated in a chair with many captions ending with the phrase "the lie detector determined that was a lie."  Sarcastic clapping[5] was parodied as early as 1991 in an Saturday Night Live skit titled "The Sarcastic Clapping Family of Southhampton."[6] Online, this type of sarcastic clapping was used as a text-based reaction as early as February 2003 on the alt.fan.don-n-mike[7] newsgroup in a discussion of a different Saturday Night Live skit. The image of Starecat first appeared as a disapproving reaction face throughout 4chan. The cat's given name is Helia Peppercats,[1] a golden-shaded British shorthair cat owned by the Russian breeder Peppercats.[2] She was born November 24th, 2004 and has earned the Federation Internationale Feline title of International Champion. How Helia was given either of her nicknames is still unclear, however she had been deemed "Grafics Cat" as early as July 6th, 2010[11] on 4chan's comic book board, /co/. One of the earliest archived examples of Starecat derivatives took place in a thread on /v/ (videogames), from August 22nd, 2010.[3]   In Season 5 Episode 4 of the television drama series Breaking Bad, the protagonist Walter White and his son Walter Jr. rev their car engines while the closed caption reads "[revving intensifies]". On December 27th, 2012, an image macro featuring the Gorilla Munch cereal mascot with the caption "Rustling Intensifies" (shown below) was posted to the /tv/ (Television & Film) board on 4chan[7] in response to the television crime drama series The Wire being called "a cop show." On July 17th, 2013, Tumblr user Burgrs posted a cartoon drawing of a spider holding a steaming mug with the caption “helo would u like some of this hot choclety milk?” (shown below). In the first two months, the post gained over 58,900 notes. On January 17th, 2013, YouTuber Eltorro64Alt uploaded a tutorial video on how to make Garry’s Mod machinima videos. On the following day, YouTuber ugotaphonenumber uploaded a video titled “SeeS or Soos?”, in which two TF2 characters repeatedly utter “sees” and “soos” back and forth. (shown below, right). In the first nine months, the video gained over 345,000 views and 3,600 comments. Owned and operated by Japanese real estate company P Studio, Hanazono Room[1] was built in Tokyo's Shinjuku district sometimes in the early 2000s. Due to its proximity to Japanese model agencies and production companies, the studio's indoor pool became frequently used as a backdrop for swimsuit photo shoots and adult films, especially low-budget productions with limitations on location shoots. However, it is unclear exactly when people took notice of the location or coined the nickname "That Pool." On September 8th, 2013, during the Major League Soccer (MLS) season match between New York Bulls and Houston Dynamo, New York Bulls' captain Thierry Henry scored a goal at 47 minutes into the first half of the game, breaking his recent streak of no goals in six consecutive games. Upon scoring, Henry immediately got up on his feet and leaned against the goal post to celebrate his goal. Then on September 14th, Henry once again staged the same ceremony after scoring the first goal during a season match against Toronto FC. On September 19th, The YouTube sportscast channel KICKTV[1] tweeted an illustration breaking down the elements of Henry's unenthusiastic goal ceremony, dubbing the pose "Henrying" in similar fashion to the previous photo fads based on athletes. Head down. Hand on hip. This is #Henrying (GIF: http://t.co/EalfoziagA) 101: pic.twitter.com/axY3JullDt Inside the MLP fandom "Scootaloo Is A Chicken" gag comes from the show when Scootaloo being mocked by the character Appleboom, pretty similar as the other fandom-inside jokes. Weird looking face of scootaloo comes from the 3th season episode 4 while Scootaloo skips around(shown below). The catchphase comes from an adult cartoon show "Aqua Teen Hunger Force"’s third season premiere, “Video Ouija,” which was an episode where Master Shake is ground into a stew in Carl’s pool.[1] In order to resurrect Shake, Frylock hires “Billy Witch Doctor,” whom specializes in resurrecting chickens. After numerous pranks, the group comes together in a séance circle and begins the resurrection ritual, which despite Frylock’s questioning, was supposedly for more than chickens. The ritual would involve Billy smacking his chicken staff to the ground, urging the group to chant, “Arise, Chicken, Arise!” After many failed attempts, Frylock gets bored and kills Billy with his laser beam eyes.[1]  While there are many versions of the story about how this meme was created, the correct one is: A Brazilian poster created a thread on Ylilauta's /int/ board, asking people to suggest memes he could force on Krautchan's /int/ board, since that board is hated by most Ylilautan posters due to the posters there being "Assburgers". THCM's personal friend (under an anonymous Icelandic poster name and icon) posted THCM's picture on that thread,telling the OP and other posters to force it as much as they could. Since the posters liked that picture so much, they immediately started doing so on Krautchan's /int/. However, it wasn't successful. A German poster from Krautchan (under the name "that Singen autism",), that people suspected was one of Krautchan's admins, went to Ylilauta's /int/, and started forcing THCM's picture there (along with other spin-offs he created himself) as much as he could, probably as "payback" for the raids Ylilauta had done on Krautchan in the past. The meme actually caught on in Ylilauta, thus leading to most users embracing it, and naming it "Thin Hair Chin Man". Nowadays, the meme spawns many spin-offs, and is one of the most popular memes in Ylilauta. It has also been spread around 4chan and the wider interwebs. This song was written by the independent artist in 2008 and it was included to his music album "Tsugaru Mandara" (津軽曼荼羅) released in November of thay year. Its title "Shinmachi" refers to a town name known as the bustling area in Aomori City, Aomori Prefecture[1] which is on edge of north in Honshu island and has a severe winter and slumping economy. And, this song is fully consisting of Hiroyā's impassioned plea for "Sex". Written and directed by Japanese film director and animator Hayao Miyazaki, My Neighbor Totoro was released in 1988 and met by much critical acclaim in both Japan and overseas.[1] In one particularly memorable scene (shown below), the two main characters Satsuki and Mei are seen standing next to a bus stop while waiting in the rain for their father’s bus to arrive. As the two daughters wait, the forest spirit character Totoro appears at the bus stop as well, with only a leaf on his head to shield himself from the rain. Satsuki then gives Totoro the umbrella they had been saving for their father to help protect him from the rain. The scene was used as the theatrical poster for the film’s Japanese release.[6] The earliest known parody of the scene was created by deviantART user ~sachsen[7] and uploaded on June 16th, 2007. The grimdark fan illustration portrays Totoro as a sharp-teethed, flesh-eating monster who appears to have eaten the children's father, while Satsuki stands blood-soaked beside him, holding a rifle along with the umbrella. As of September 2013, the image has been viewed more than 614,000 times and favorited more than 34,000 times with nearly 5,700 comments. On September 12th, 2013, a resident of Troutdale, Oregon snapped a photograph (shown below, left) of a homeless, feral cat missing its right eye. In hoping to find a new home for the injured animal, the photographer then shared the picture with friends on Facebook. On the following day, the one-eyed cat and his two siblings were brought into the Multnomah County Animal Shelter, all suffering from upper respiratory infections and calicivirus, a highly infectious feline disease.[2] In addition, the one-eyed cat was also diagnosed with a broken jaw, flea anemia and a heart murmur. On September 14th, local resident Blazer Schaffer volunteered to foster the trio until they were healthy enough to be adopted. That same day, she submitted a photo of the newly-dubbed "Sir Stuffington" (shown below, right) on photo sharing site Imgur[3], where it gained more than 284,000 views and 360 comments in nine days. One of the earliest novelty accounts on Reddit was GeorgeWBush[16], a parody of former President George W. Bush created on September 17th, 2006. Though the account has not posted since January 2009, Bush's last night in office, it accrued more than 16,000 comment karma while it was active. On July 17th, 2008, the single serving site CakeFarts.com was launched with a video clip of a nude woman expelling gas on to a variety of cakes. As September 2013, the original site is no longer in operation, however, there are several mirror sites and duplicate uploads available online.   The original clip, simply titled "Waffle Falling Over,"[1] was uploaded as part of an ongoing documentary project by YouTuber Schnooleheletteletto on August 14th, 2013. However, the video largely remained under the radar until it was linked to Reddit[2] on September 9th. In the following 48 hours, the YouTube video garnered more than 630,000 views and at least 8,600 likes. Prior to the viral takeoff of "Waffle Falling Over," Schnooleheletteletto[7] had uploaded a handful of similar videos in which various food items are shown succumbing to the gravity (shown below). This phrase "Houtou Yeah!" was uttered by Maiko Saito (斉藤舞子)[1], a female TV announcer belonging to Fuji Television, in a weekend morning show "Haretara Iine!" (晴れたらイイねッ!, lit. It'll be a beautiful day)[2] originally aired on November 27th, 2005. According to the official digest archive for this episode[3], participants including her went to foot of Mt. Fuji to report Houtou (ほうとう)[4], a popular regional dish in Yamanashi prefecture. While the traveling, they visited a small stand in Heartland Asagiri guest ranch, and had soft creams where the master told them "Our soft cream is so delicious, you can't help but shouting". Just after eating it, she got so excited to deliciousness of the soft cream and suddenly ran out to road while shouting the remark "Houtou Yeah!" even though it wasn't Houtou-flavour. Then, she fell down flat on a halfway and dropped her soft cream like a child. Translation:  On August 27th, 2013, the SourceFedNERD YouTube channel released one of their regular "TableTalk" shows where they discuss topics submitted by their fans. They had recently moved to a new set for this show, and Steve Zaragoza, said "When I was a kid, I wanted nothing more than to be an entertainer.. what have we got over there, a coffee machine's goin'?" Elliott Morgan instantly picked him up on this, mimicking him by saying "What is THAT? Is that, like, a coffee machine?!" Steve then used it in context as a meme by imitating a dean, saying "When you come to this school… what is that a coffee machine?" and they continued to use examples throughout the remainder of the show, finishing the show by panning the camera around to show the coffee machine is actually whirring on the set: http://youtu.be/SV3O60kwJuM?t=11m21s On September 6th, 2013, Tumblr user chronicallylate[1] posted a photo set titled “How To Make a Cute Dress Out of Shorts,” which demonstrates how to turn a pair of gym shorts into a women's dress in a three-step process. The post was subsequently featured on Tumblr's staff-curated LOL tag, receiving more than 343,000 notes within the first 72 hours. Ylvis is a comedy duo from Bergen, Norway consisting of brothers Bård and Vegard Ylvisåker.[1] Active since 2000, the group is primarily known in their home country for improvisational comedy on the TV Norge network.[1] "The Fox" was written and recorded by the duo for their TV series I Kveld med YLVIS[2] and was produced by renowned Norwegian production duo StarGate.[3] The music video for the song was directed by Ole Martin Hafsmo[4] and uploaded to the TV Norge YouTube channel on September 3rd, 2013.[5] The video features people dressed in animal costumes dancing in time with onomatopoeic sounds describing what a fox would sound like. Within the first week, the YouTube upload garnered more than 11.4 million views and 57,000 comments. On September 5th, 2013, The Daily Mail[1] published an article with paparazzi photographs of the celebrity couple Jay-Z and Beyonce Knowles vacationing in Stromboli, Italy on Knowles’ 32nd birthday, which included an image of Jay-Z awkwardly diving off a luxury boat into the ocean (shown below). The same day, Twitter user ReedoBrown tweeted a photoshopped image of rapper Lil’ Wayne falling off a skateboard with Jay-Z diving behind him. In the first four days, the tweet gained over 180 retweets and 45 favorites. JAY-Z TRY TO CATCH WEEZY pic.twitter.com/PmGcOJfvem On February 2, 2013, a Facebook page was created under the name "Why helo it is i jimbles notronbo", which occasionally posts images from the show. On August 8, 2013, a Twitter account was created under the name "Jimbles Notronbo" that has not been active since September 2013. Another Twitter account launched on October 27, 2013 under the name "jimbles notronbo" that has actively posted since it's creation. A YouTube account has also been created on Feb 26, 2013, and has uploaded 4 videos, the latest one on Dec 23, 2013. The channel's videos are meant to be random and non-sensical, this has also followed with the comments section of the videos. According to the Online Etymology Dictionary,[1][2] the earliest known appearance of the word "plebeian" in English was used in the 1530s to describe the class of citizens who were not members of the ruling class in ancient Rome. Meanwhile, The earliest appearance of the colloquial shorthand “pleb” can be found in Irish writer John O’Keefe's 1795 comedic play Life’s Vagaries, as cited by the Oxford Dictionaries[6] blog: "You’re under my roof, you pleb."   In fiction, canon refers to the conceptual material accepted the work is based on, being the overall set of storyline, premises, settings, and characters offered by the source work, and the specific incidents, relationships, or story arcs that take place within the overall canon. The term dates back to Ronald Knox's 1911 essay "Studies in the Literature of Sherlock Holmes" to distinguish Holmes stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle from those penned by fans of the character. The term "headcanon" has been used to describe fan-given traits since as early as July 2007, when a LiveJournal fanfiction author used the term to describe her interpretation of the mother of Gwen from the animated sci-fi franchise Ben 10. Although the first usage of these style of text posts is impossible to trace back, the reason of the common letters can be explained. The most common keyboard style used by modern day technology follows the QWERTY-style[3] key layout (shown below, left). On QWERTY keyboards, the home row consist of the letters "asdf" and "jkl;" for the left and right hand (shown below, right). With standard browsing, people commonly use their right hand for the mouse. Because of this, quick replies typed in the style of grawlix commonly make use of only the left hand to prioritize browsing and replying speed. Stringing home row keys together in place of words as a way to test a system dates back to as early as November 1995.[8] One of the earliest instances of a string of letters being used as a method of expressing an intense emotion was submitted to Urban Dictionary[7] on August 1st, 2006 when "asdfasdf" was defined as signifying "a number of emotions including but not limited to distress, anger, amazement, joy, disbelief, confusion, dumbfoundedness, fear, and despair." The definition also used "asdfjkl," "asdffda," "asdfdsa," ";alsfkdj" and "fjdksal;" as similar examples, each featuring a string of letters from the home row of a QWERTY keyboard.  The anime series was aired between January and March in 2011 and its ending theme song "Ari Ari Mirai" was sung by Japanese voice actors Erika Kitamura, Marina Inoue and Kazusa Aranami. However, it had totally fallen behind Puella Magi Madoka Magica the huge succeeded TV anime aired in the same season. Instead, it caught an attention among anime Otakus due to its out-of-date character design, characters' too long neck, and the ending movie in which almost all scenes were made only by scrolling stock images (shown below, left). This quite cheap and strange ending movie soon became to a topic on the Japanese web, and people began to post many parody videos to the Japanese video sharing service Nico Nico Douga (NND) after this Pokemon version was uploaded around the middle of February 2011 (Shown below, right).  This 17th century Anglo-American song is given original Japanese lyrics taken from fatherless mountain lovers' song about Japanese North Alps[2] and has been familiar to Japanese people as a lively mountain song "Alps of 10,000 shaku[3]" (アルプス一万尺, Arupusu Ichiman Jaku). Besides, it's a popular hand-crapping song among Japanese children since 1960s (shown below, left). Meanwhile, the trigger of this fad was a hand-drawn animated video titled "Stylish Ichiman Jaku" where Archer and Tokiomi Tohsaka from Fate/Zero, a prequel to Fate/Stay Night by Type Moon, strike "stylish" posing and a smug look along with the song (shown below, right). This video was posted to NND by female user Kei (けい)[4] on December 3rd, 2011. The creator said in the video's description[5] that she made it to introduce this very stylish and elegant hand game invented by a frined of hers and share it with other people. Translation:  In the 2001 comedy film Zoolander, the main character, Derek Zoolander (played by Ben Stiller), says the line in anger after confusing a scale model of his charity project Derek Zoolander Center for Kids Who Can't Read Good with the actual building itself. Derek Zoolander: What is this? [smashes the model for the reading center] A center for ants? Mugatu: What? Derek Zoolander: How can we be expected to teach children to learn how to read… if they can't even fit inside the building? Mugatu: Derek, this is just a small… Derek Zoolander: I don't wanna hear your excuses! The building has to be at least… three times bigger than this! Mugatu: He's absolutely right you know.   The original soda-shaking animation was created by Nico Nico Douga user Chikurin no min (竹林の民), and was uploaded to the site on October 14th, 2012.[2] It was initially shown as bonus footage for a "smooooch ・∀・" parody video (shown below, left) featuring the 2channel characters known as Yaranaio.[3] An extended version of the animation, which also included a pie fight between the characters, would be uploaded to Niconico by its creator a week later, on October 22nd, 2012.[4] (shown below, right) Confessions aired on August 25th, 2013 on AMC, immediately receiving widespread critical acclaim, with many reviewers citing it as one of the best episodes of the series.[1][2] During the episode, Walter White (played by Brian Cranston) is shown giving his in-laws a DVD supposedly containing his confession to being the mysterious Heisenberg. While watching the video at home, Hank and Marie Schrader (played by Dean Norris and Betsy Brandt, respectively) discover it is actually blackmail as Walt names Hank as the mastermind of the Heisenberg empire, and claims he coerced Walt into cooking meth for him. The unconventional spelling of the phrase "that though" was most likely conceived during the rise of SMS communications and microblogging platforms in the mid to late-2000s, with the earliest notion of "dat" and "tho" found in the title of the Facebook community "I hate when people don't spell right (dis, dat, tho, u, nd, lik, etc.)," which was created on November 2nd, 2009. On April 16th, 2013, YouTuber TSirDiesAlot[7] uploaded a video game video titled "Dat Dagger Tho." As of July 2014, the video has gained over 100,000 views. The line 'It's No Use' is said by Silver the Hedgehog, a hedgehog from the future that Sonic must battle in a boss fight. He says it every time the player attempts to get near to Silver, or when Silver gets close to the player. The soundtrack to Cave Story was made available some time in 2010 via CaveStory.org[2] and that year, YouTuber mssnor[3] uploaded the first remix video using one of these tracks. The video remixed the game's self-titled theme (shown below, left) with artwork from the cartoon webseries Baman Piderman (shown below, right). Though mssnor's account was later deactivated, the video was reuploaded by vbictor97 on July 5th, 2010, gaining more than 8,100 views. On April 22nd, 2013, Vine user Ryan McHenry[1] began uploading a series of videos titled "Ryan Gosling Won't Eat His Cereal." The videos feature various screen projections of Canadian actor Ryan Gosling’s intense acting scenes meanwhile at the end the videographer is approaching his spoon full of cereal. The origin and spread of this meme seems to have originated on social networks. Given that there is no consesus as to what template to create aside from the wording, it is difficult to pinpoint its exact creation. However, the first use of this joke was from the movie "Hangover", where in a scene, the character Sid Garner (played by Jeffery Tambor) tells Doug Billings (played by Justin Bartha) that "what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas… Except for Herpes". Sasso uploaded his first lemon Vine titled "Facing personal challenges head-on." on February 19, 2013, depicting him looking at the fruits displayed in the grocery store. After returning to his car with a bag of lemons, he is shown spitting one out of his mouth seemingly out of nowhere. As of August 2013, he has uploaded multiple other videos of this nature, however lemons are not always present prior to his final spit. According to custom Google search, the Racist Dog page has existed since January 21 2010 On February 9th, 2013, Vine user Marlo Meekins and her husband Nick Cross uploaded videos in which Meekins turns her head towards the camera while drooling a dark liquid from her mouth with "Everybody Hurts" playing in the background. Following a tumblr post by user theyaimtomisbehave that was posted onto the image sharing site imgur, people began to band around the idea of using Cosmo as a meme. This prompted imgur user wowthisisalongusernameitbetterendsoonitisbeginningtostrainmyeyes to make a post featuring the first use of the "Cosmo Sex Tips" meme, and also providing the template for others to use the meme. The post went viral, with the original post and another album featuring Cosmo Sex Tips memes hitting the imgur front page. The advice animal originates from the single topic blog "Carceral Feminist Cat". The content of the blog varies from actual critiques of carceral feminism to comments on the laziness of cats. The blog h THIS PAGE IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION. EDITORS AND IMAGE UPLOADS WELCOME.  The source footage of Ernie and Bert sketch is taken from 801th episode in Sesame Street originally aired on December 8th, 1975 (shown below, left).[2] In 2007, a YouTuber HAYW1R3[3] made a remix of this video with the song "A Divine Proclamation of Finishing The Present Existence" by Dutch goregrind band Last Days Of Humanity[4] (shown below, right). As of August 2013, this video has earned over 5.4 million page views. On July 15th, 2008, a Facebook[3] group titled "One Million Strong Against Unnecessarily Long CVS Receipts" was launched, which mocked the drugstore chain in the page's description: "My last CVS receipt for $3.34 was 25.5 inches long. And that's too fucking long. I don't care that they use my CVS card to track me across the planet, I just want a receipt that isn't 1/3rd my height."  The game Age of Time was created by Eric "Badspot" Hartman who also created a fairly popular blocky sandbox game called Blockland. Abbreviated AoT, it is an action/rpg game created on the Torque Game Engine which is now not very popular and has not been updated since about 2007. It shares a portion of its forum with the popular Blockland forums where users now sometimes create joke topics. In the Clan Discussion section, a user named Acerblock created a humorous clan called TOSSMATAOTG that was imitating "overprotective urban soccer moms" who are against pornography and protect their children from NSFW content on the internet. At one point, user Ipquarx from another joke clan called SGFKSUWNSOA told his members to unite in a point in the topic. On January 9th, 2013, Tumblr user andrewpauldavis[18] submitted a screenshot of an Instagram post in which he commented "Oh I love hot dogs" on a photograph of a pair of legs in a bathtub (shown below). Within six years, the post gained over 55,500 notes. The game was developed by the indie game developer animey, a 19-year old student from Caen, France.[1] The game was released in April 2013 and, by the great success of the game, a sequel is planned.[2]    In the action-comedy film series Austin Powers[1], the antagonist Dr. Evil (played by Mike Myers) often resorts to air quotes to highlight certain keywords when discussing his world domination strategies, most notably in the second installment of the series, Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (shown below): On October 3rd, 2012, FunnyJunk[5] user niack submitted an image macro featuring an outline illustration of Dr. Evil making the air quote gesture with the caption "I call it / 'YOLO'" (shown below).  The phrase originates from the 2001 film, Training Day. The film is about two LAPD narcotics detectives who enforce the law in the ganglands of Los Angeles. At one point in the film, Denzel Washington's character and Ethan Hawke's character are in a car, and are having a conversation about something. During the conversation, Washington's character says to Hawke's character, "Mah Nigga," and puts what appears to be a marijuana joint in his mouth.   Prior to the advent of image manipulation software, black-and-white photographs were colorized using hand-coloring[1] techniques with watercolors, oils, crayons, pastels or other paints applied to the original image surface. Computerized colorization came with the proliferation of digital image processing with cheaper computers in the 1970s.[2] On July 25th, 2002, the earliest known photo colorization tutorial was posted on the photo manipulation blog Worth 1000.[10] The fourth episode of the anime Kiniro Mosaic, which was produced by Studio Gokumi, was originally aired in Japan on July 27th, 2013. In the used footage, which can be found after the intro, the characters Aya Komichi and Yoko Inokuma remembered Shinobu Omiya's birthday and gave her gifts. Alice Cartelet realized she couldn't give her an object as a gift, so she sang the song "Happy Birthday" in Japanese. At the end, Shinobu is asking desperately to Alice why she didn't sing the song normally in English. On April 29th, 2011, Tumblr user NaturalChocolate[1] posted a photograph of a blue watermelon slice (shown below). Within two weeks,[3] Tumblr user Unremixable[2] reblogged the photo, adding a caption claiming that the fruit is a "moonmelon" that grows in parts of Japan and can alter the taste of other foods after it is consumed. In the first three years, the post gained over 76,000 notes. On July 1st, 1999, the Phoenix New Times[4] published an article about a collection of humorous 911 call anecdotes titled Did You Say An Alligator? published by Tolleson, Arizona emergency operator Beth Compton. In June 2001, Leland Gregory's collection of offbeat 911 phone call transcripts were published as a book titled What's The Number For 911 Again?. In the early 2000s, funny or offbeat 911 emergency calls were mostly spread via message boards in the form of transcripts, though some audio recordings were occasionally played on-air by radio jockeys. On February 10th, 2003, Neoseeker[2] forums member Weatherlover submitted a thread containing transcripts of humorous 911 calls from What's the Number for 911 Again?.   In May 1997, a blogger known as Deuce of Clubs received a copy of the independent zine Wig Out![1] at a show for the punk band Girl Trouble. In the Letters to the Editor section, a letter from Californian Mr. N. described a telephone located in the middle of the Mojave desert, 15 miles from the main highway. After going on a trek to find it, he learned the booth was put there after World War II for the people working in a nearby mine that ceased operations in the 1960s. Finding that it was still operational, Mr. N provided the number, (619) 733-9969, for anyone interested in calling. The number later changed area codes from (619) to (760). Deuce of Clubs began calling the number every day for approximately a month before someone answered the phone. Soon after, he launched a website[2] dedicated to the phone booth to share his personal calling experiences as well as draw more attention to the lone booth.  On July 5th, 2013, YouTuber rhubarblady uploaded a video in which two people are shown confronting a woman who is stealing rhubarb on their property (shown below). Upon being questioned, the angry woman begins to aggressively insult the property owner by calling her a "bitch" and claims the rhubarb is available to the public. The original video has since been removed. Rhubarb Lady: You Pinocchio fuckin' nose -- go mind your own business! Fence Lady: Why don't you? Rhubarb Lady: Why don't you? Fence Lady: Why don't you grow your own? Rhubarb Lady: This is not your fucking property, go somewhere else! Fence Lady: [Something something] my property … Rhubarb Lady: Fuck you!

Transcript via NY Mag.[6] On July 27th, 2013, YouTuber anangrysockpuppet uploaded a video titled “Team Service Announcement: ‘Pop it, Don’t Drop it’” in which the Medic is shown giving the middle finger and dancing to "Dream a Dream" by Captain Jack after evading the enemy's ambush by using the ÜberCharge (shown below). In the first three weeks, the video gained over 200,000 views and 1,300 comments. On January 5th, 2007, YouTuber Kwilinski uploaded a video of a six month old deaf child hearing for the first time following the activation of his cochlear implant device (shown below).    The collaboration was announced[5] on October 22rd, 2012 with the launch of Domino's Japan Vocalo Creative Club[6], asking fans of Hatsune Miku to help contribute song ideas or illustrations so Domino's could produce their own song with the character. An introduction video (shown below) was also posted on Domino's Japan's official YouTube channel seeking contributors for the project. Over the course of the next several months, Domino's uploaded progress videos in a series titled Road to VocaloidP to their YouTube[7] and Nico Nico Douga[8] channels. By December 2012, three songs had been written.[9] On March 6th, 2013 Domino's announced the launch of a Miku Hatsune mobile app in a YouTube video featuring the CEO and President of Domino's Japan, Scott Oelkers. It was reuploaded to their Nico Nico Douga channel[10] the following day. As of August 2013, the announcement has nearly 760,000 combined views. In addition to naming a handful of Domino's employees who had been involved in making the Vocaloid songs previously available on the Domino's Japan Vocalo Creative Club, the announcement reveals that the collaboration would also including Hatsune Miku-themed pizza boxes (mirror below). Meme was created on Coub: platform for creating mashups of looped videos and sounds. "Eye to Eye" was released in April 2013 and had been airing on several music programs in Pakistan. The music video was already uploaded to his Dailymotion[2] and Vimeo[3] account in that month. However, it became viral via Twitter and Facebook after the video was posted to YouTube in the end of June 2013. eye to eye, eye to eye essential, sensational eye's my eye's and your eye's colorful eye's our eye's fabulous, exciting eye's eye to eye, eye to eye hmmm, hmmm, hmmm aahaaha, aahaaha, aahaaha keep your love in the soul make love with eye to eye your face and glorious eye's i' can see with my spectrum eye's it's a genuine classic love serious feelings romantic love my pride eye to eye glowing with your sparkling eye's our elegant special love sincere promise blessful love eye to eye, eye to eye simple, charming eye's my eye's and your eye's dreaming fairie's eye's our eye's stylish excellent human's eye's eye to eye, eye to eye hmmm, hmmm, hmmm aahaaha, aahaaha, aahaaha eye to eye make's epic era love life time once in a life. substantial love is heaven for precise eye's. spectacular eye's, our eye's, my eyes and your eye's, eye to eye, eye to eye beautiful eye's has endless love your eye's are like sun shine your precious heart belongs to me because i' love you true love always smile, you are mine, always mine, your love is faithful forever and ever without you i' am like a butterfly without flower eye to eye, eye to eye hmmm, hmmm, hmmm aahaaha, aahaaha, aahaaha wonderful, gorgeous eye's my eye's and your eye's emotional and happy eye's all lovely eye's full of life eye to eye, eye to eye hmmm, hmmm, hmmm aahaaha, aahaaha, aahaaha Via: Taher Shah Official Website[4]   The earliest known incident of violence resulting from playing the so-called "Knockout Game"[1] took place in St. Louis, Missouri on April 16th, 2011, when the then-18-year-old Elex Levell Murphy fatally punched 72-year-old Vietnamese immigrant Hoang Nguyen to his death. According to the police investigation[2][3], the attack was revealed to be part of a dangerous game "which involves unprovoked attacks on innocent bystanders." The song “We Can’t Stop” was released as the lead single for Miley Cyrus’ fourth studio album on June 3rd, 2013. On the following day, the official Miley Cyrus Facebook[3] page announced that the singer’s upcoming music video for the song will feature a series of fan-made twerking videos. The status update also contained a link to a Facebook application[4] through which the fans could submit their videos with the hashtag #FanMade.[5] On June 19th, the music video premiered on the MileyCyrusVEVO YouTube channel (shown below), which gained over 105.8 million views and 746,000 comments in the first six weeks. The shot of the character was taken from a scene in the film "The Iron Giant", which was released in August 6th, 1999. The image since then has been modified and used as a reaction image. The earliest documented usage of it can be dated back to June 1st 2009 on 4chan's /tg/ (Traditional Games) board [1], in a thread discussing techpriest and psyker melee capabilities in Warhammer 40K. On July 16th, 2013, Tay Allyn published the music video for her song "Mass Text" on YouTube (shown below). Within the first two weeks, the video received over 770,000 views, 10,400 comments and 23,000 down votes. As early as July 2007, descriptions of how to play One-Man Hide and Seek were posted on Japanese horror bulletin boards.[9] The instructions tell the reader to fill a bathtub with stuffed animals, turn off all of the lights and chant ritualistic phrases while holding a knife. It asserted that people who had done this found that the toys had moved slightly and the television had turned on, blaring music. Around the same time, Japanese YouTubers began uploading videos[8] documenting the results of their attempted rituals.   The earliest known reunion video to spread online is a video clip a man hugging a lion named Christian from the 1971 Australian documentary Christian, The Lion at World's End (shown below), which was first posted on a fan web site in 2002.[1] The use of the misspelled word "doge" to refer to a dog dates back to June 24th, 2005, when it was mentioned in an episode of Homestar Runner's puppet show. In the episode titled "Biz Cas Fri 1"[2], Homestar calls Strong Bad his "d-o-g-e" while trying to distract him from his work.  "Panchira of Joy-Toy" is a comical rock tune drawing men's passion to Panchira (パンチラ)[2], situation of female underwear being glimpsed from skirts or pants. It was included in Group Tamashii's second major album Araburu Nihon no Tamashii Tachi (荒ぶる日本の魂たち) released on June 23rd, 2004. The first hand-drawn animated video was posted to NND on June 24th, 2008[3] by NND user cdm. The characters reproducing the lyrics along with the song in this video come from CAPCOM's video game series Sengoku BASARA.[4] Due to its lovely illustrations and comical rendition, the original video on NND had reached over 1 million page views in October 2012. ore ga panchira miteru wake janee! omae ga panchira miseten darou! sou darou! koushou seiritsu!

Twice more than before I need heeeeelp!   The concept of Madoka Titus was conceived by dozens of Japanese Twitter users at an offline meet-up for plastic model hobbyists held in Akihabara, Tokyo on November 23rd, 2011. During the meet-up, participants began swapping the arms and legs of their figures with those of Gundam AGE-1 Titus close combat mobile suits. The suits had been mocked for their overly macho and bulky design by Gundam fans (shown below, left). Photos of the hybrid figures created by this limb swap were then uploaded to witter (shown below, center & right) described as "Titus mode."[3]  This whiskey, Zen, aired 21 types of TVCMs in total from 1998 to 2004. All of them featured Japanese actor Hiroyuki Sanada (真田広之)[1] and had the same punchline: in serious situations or good atmosphere, he denies or disagrees suggestions/questions with quite cool face by this remark "Zenzen" (全然, lit. "Nope" or "Not at all"). Then, two Zen bottles appeared on the screen with his voice "Zen, Zen". The most well-known version in this series is "A Singing Man" played first in this video below. It originally began to air in September 2001. However, Zen's TVCM series hadn't been featured on internet humor sites till 2010s though it was indeed humorous. Suntory discontinued the production of Zen in 2004, and erased its product page[2] from their official website in the end of 2011. In early January 2012, DirecTV launched a new advertising campaign dubbed "Get Rid of Cable." Created by New York-based ad agency Grey New York, the first three commercials for the satellite TV company poke fun at some of the most common frustrations experienced by cable TV subscribers, such as dealing with the customer service and increasing price of cable bills, while encouraging the viewers to switch to DirecTV in order to avoid the hassle altogether. On January 3rd, the first installment of the series titled "Don't Wake Up in a Roadside Ditch" was uploaded to The DirecTV YouTube channel, garnering over a million views within 18 months. On January 22nd, the earliest known parody of the commercial was uploaded by YouTuber KartoonManagement in a video titled "Don't Get Anally Raped." On May 28th, 2013, the Cheerios YouTube channel uploaded a commercial produced by the advertising company Saatchi & Saatchi titled “Just Checking,” in which a mixed-race child asks her white mother if Cheerios are healthy before jumping to a scene of her black father waking up from a nap to find a pile of the cereal on his chest (shown below). In the first two months, the video gained over 4.1 million views.  Mobile Suit Gundam AGE was aired from October 2011 to September 2012, and its production focused on getting new low-age Gundam fans. So, different from the previous titles, there were many comic-like depictions in its storylines, characters and mobile suits designs. It often became the subject of controversy among existing Gundam fans, and the anime finally didn't achieve enough commercial success as a Gundam title. In that context, the remark was uttered by Iwark Bria (イワーク・ブライア) in the 6th episode aired on November 13th, 2011. In the scene, this middle-aged guy with oddly short fat body (shown above) told the protagonists, Flit and Emily, with a detached tone about their hard life forced by pointless ideologies of people on topside in their space colony. Shortly after, he suddenly uttered the remark along with saturated linework. Transcript This combination of Iwark's serious remark, quite eager look and strange body shape, and sudden comic-like saturated linework effect in inappropriate timing gave a strong feeling of strangeness to viewers. Furthermore, his ridiculousness was so much emphasized by his foolhardy attack to battle mobile suits by unstylish work mobile suit "Desperado". As early as September 2009, fans from the Pixar Planet[2] message board theorized about whether or not Pixar's films existed in the same universe. In nearly 50 discussion posts, fans noted that the films sometimes offered small nods to each other, including a child reading a The Incredibles comic in Finding Nemo (shown below, left) and a postcard with Up characters Carl and Ellie's home address appearing in the trailer for Toy Story 3 (shown below, right). Pacific Rim[3] is a 2013 American science fiction film directed by Guillermo del Toro and released by the American film production company Legendary Pictures, which was first premiered in London on July 4th and later followed by an American release on July 12th. The film is set in the 2020s, when Earth is under attack by colossal monsters called Kaiju. To fight these monsters humanity has created gigantic humanoid mechas called Jaegers. To promote the film, Warner Bros added a Jaeger Designer app[1] to the official site[2] on May 11th, 2013, which allowed users to customize their own Jaegers alongside given them a name and a country of origin.     The American reality television series Storage Wars premiered on the A&E Network on December 1st, 2010, featuring the auctioneering couple Dan and Laura Dotson and several buyers, including Barry Weiss, Darrell and Brandon Sheets, Jarrod Schulz, Brandi Passante and Dave Hester. When rent is not paid on a storage locker for three months in California, the contents can be sold by an auctioneer as a single lot of items. The show follows professional buyers who purchase the contents of the lockers based on five-minute inspections of what they can see from the door while it is open. Hester is known for bidding on units by using his signature catchphrase "Yuuup!" 4chan's anonymous posting style has long been a way for users to request and post socially unacceptable content and taboos without facing many risks. Although 4chan houses content that other areas of the internet wouldn't post in public, the site still maintains a set of rules which also forbid the posting of "anything that violates local or United States law".[1] Regardless of this, users commonly try to post such content with the hope the site moderators won't spot it, such as in "mods are asleep" threads. On October 17th, 2011, FunnyJunk user pablocabron submitted a demotivational poster image featuring a seagull resting on the head of an eagle with the caption "Excuse me, sir / Can you spare a moment for Jesus Christ?" (shown below). Within the next two years, the post received more than 3,800 up votes and 450 comments.  On June 16th, 2011, Kyle M uploaded a video titled “Keisha Fabo” (shown below), in which two 3D custom avatars from The Sims gossip about their friend’s sex life. In the first three years, the video gained over 1.35 million views and 2,700 comments. On March 15th, 2013, “Blurred Lines” was released as the lead single for Robin Thicke’s sixth studio album of the same name. Five days later on March 20th, the music video was released as both explicit[7] and edited (shown below) versions, featuring Thicke, T.I. and Pharrell flirting with scantily clad models Emily Ratajkowski, Jessi M’Bengue and Elle Evans. As of August 2013, the censored YouTube upload has been viewed nearly 129 million times while the uncensored version has gained more than 8.7 million views. Following its viral reception, Thicke revealed that Universal Interscope Records refused to fund the production of the music video, saying that the executives "didn't get" the song,[25] but he was able to secure the budget from Rémy Martin, a French cognac firm where Thicke and his wife serve as spokespeople. The single topic Tumblr blog “Animals Being Dicks”[7] was launched on July 11th, 2011, with the first post highlighting an animated GIF of two dolphins colliding in mid-air (shown below). Within the first two years, the post gained over 470 notes. On June 3rd, 2011, One Direction member Harry Styles tweeted the phrase "I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair." Though it went unattributed, it may have been a reference to the title of Scottish singer-songwriter Sandi Thom's 2005 debut single.[1] By July 2013, this tweet had been retweeted more than 55,000 times and favorited more than 32,000 times. Though it went relatively unnoticed at first, around March 28th, 2013, One Direction fans began tweeting photoshopped images of Styles wearing flower crowns in response to this tweet. I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair. In 2011, Kanye West and Jay-Z collaborated on the song "No Church In The Wild" for their album "Watch The Throne". The song featured Frank Ocean and The-Dream and was released as the last single from the album on March 12, 2012 and features themes of decadence and religion. On August 25th, 2003, the song “Milkshake” was released on August 25th, 2003 as the lead single for Kelis' third studio album Tasty. During the chorus, Kelis repeats the phrase “My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard” in alluding to her own sex appeal.  On May 10th, 2011, DeviantArt user seniorpony submitted a comic titled "the pen is lonelier then the," featuring the My little Pony: Friendship is Magic character Twilight Sparkle and her well-known obsession for books. In just a month over two years, the DeviantArt submission gained more than 84,000 views and 570 comments.   Although the origin of the term is currently unknown, an early use of the phrase is from the song "Ain't Gonna Suck Itself" by the country band Cracker on their 2003 album Countrysides. The song's video received a little over 40,000 views. The phrase was used online as early as December 2001 in a petition[1] to have George Lucas hand over his position of director on the third Star Wars prequel film to Peter Jackson, who directed the Lord of the Rings movie franchise. This campaign was launched in response to Lucas allegedly “ruining” the fans' childhood memories of the Star Wars through his prequel works, which were met by poor reception upon releases. The petition received 7487 signatures. The next year, the phrase "ruined childhood" was used on Something Awful[5] to describe a Photoshop Phriday contest in which users changed titles of classic literature and comics into sexual innuendos, attempting to change how people thought of the content, similar to One Letter Off Movie Posters. The illustrator behind the instruction remains unknown, however, the earliest known instance of the image was hosted on a Tumblr blog and submitted to the /r/Pics subreddit[1] on August 21st, 2010. The post received 1,787 upvotes, 893 points overall and 124 comments prior to being archived. The top comment on the post pointed out a similarity to a comic featuring parody superhero the Tick (shown below, right), in which artist Ben Edlund instructs readers to draw the tick by first drawing an oval with a line in it, followed by drawing the Tick holding the oval. This comic was first published in 1997 as part of The Tick Omnibus[2]and shared online as early as 2008.[3] Though it is unknown where the hashtag #oomf[13] originated, one of the earliest tweets using the hashtag was posted on February 21st, 2011 by @MissShantae_, who was upset that one of her followers did not text her back. #oomf didn't text me back… smh! The original photograph of the bald eagle, titled "Bald Eagle Portait #010," was taken by American nature and wildlife photographer Bob Rozinski and uploaded to his online portfolio at DancingPelican.com (shown below, left).[7] On August 6th, 2012, Redditor submitted an image macro titled "One-Up America" to the /r/AdviceAnimals[4] subreddit, featuring a bald eagle picture with the caption "Sees Britain is hosting Olympics / Lands on Mars" (shown above, right) in reference to the Curiosity Mars rover landing.  On July 22nd, 2011, Redditor x2sean1x submitted an image to the now-defunct /r/reddit.com subreddit titled Scumbag America[3] with the caption "Starts space program uniting the world / Shuts down program to fund wars" in response to NASA's final space shuttle launch earlier that month.[4] The post gained 16,151 upvotes, 653 comments and 1,805 points overall prior to being archived. On June 23 2013, Gökçek recorded a vlog against anti-government protests in Turkey, telling his fact that protests are actually based on provocations mostly held by Turkish people from abroad. The parodies are mostly used on last minute of video, Gökçek's response music after his conclusion words.  On the night of July 2nd, 2013, a 4chan anon created a new random thread on /b/, in which he requested an explosion to be added to a picture of his friend. As with most Photoshop requests on 4chan, the request was not taken seriously, people refrained from working on it and a few joke images were created. However, 22 minutes later, one anon fulfilled the request. After the first image was created, an influx of edited images were posted. At least 50 images were created and posted in this thread. The original stock photo of the bearded magician was taken by Australian photographer David Freund[1] and uploaded to iStockPhoto[2] on April 20th, 2010. Years later on July 6th, 2013, Redditor unenlightenedfool submitted the first Household Magician image macro to the /r/AdviceAnimals[4] subreddit with the caption “For my next amazing act / I will put this air mattress back into its original package,” describing the cumbersome process of repackaging an inflatable mattress after it has been used. The post received more than 17,000 upvotes, 2,300 points overall and 260 comments within 48 hours. Redditor unenlightenedfool provided the blank template for the image macro series in a comment on the post, which accrued more than 400 upvotes, making it the top comment on the thread. The brown, hound-tooth patterned baseball cap is a limited edition of Boston Red Sox A-Tooth fitted cap manufactured and licensed by New Era.

On August 2nd, 2011,On August 2nd, 2011, Twitter user Tommy Donbavand tweeted two altered titles for the books Catch 22 and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, accompanied by the hashtag #bookswithalettermissing. Cath 22 #bookswithalettermissing Charlie and the Chocolate Factor #bookswithalettermissing — Tommy Donbavand (@tommydonbavand) August 2, 2011 On June 16th, 2013, the "Exploding Actresses" Tumblr[6] blog was launched, with the first post highlighting an animated GIF of a scene from the 1959 musical The Sound of Music edited with Julie Andrews' head exploding (shown below). While the stereotypes about attention-seeking female gamers began to emerge with the popularization of online multiplayer games in the early 2000s, the earliest known use of "gurl gamer" as a derisive label can be found in a Gaia Online forum thread titled "I'm a girl gamer! GIRL GAMER PRIDE …Okay," submitted by forum member Dimigo on January 24th, 2010 (shown below). On June 26th, 2013, Hernandez was arrested for gun charges and suspected murder of his friend Odin Lloyd (shown below). Hours later, Twitter user @Amburglar_ tweeted a photo of two women posed with their arms inside their shirts with both hands behind their back as if they were handcuffed, describing the pose as "Hernandezing." First, we had Tebowing. Then, Bradying. May I present: Hernandezing pic.twitter.com/SpjojFiKka The earliest known "it was my privilege" thread was posted to the imageboard 4chan on January 9th, 2013, according to several screenshots archived on the image-hosting site Imgur (shown below).[1] In the thread, several green text stories were submitted depicting hyperbolic descriptions of typical social interactions between men and women ending with the phrase "It was my privilege." The first archived instance of the original comic dates back to December 17th, 2007, when an anonymous 4chan user managed to get a 9,000,000 GET[1] (a post with a significant post number) on 4chan's /v/ (video games) board. The comic itself shows a crudely drawn MS Paint style featuring the main character from the Devil May Cry[2] series, Dante, sending a note reading "ur a faget" to his brother Vergil in an over the top manner. On June 26th, 2013, the FIFA Confederations Cup semi-final match between Brazil and Uruguay took place at the Mineirão stadium in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. In the 86th minute, score of 1 – 1, Neymar, a 21-year-old rising star who had recently signed with Spain's renowned FC Barcelona, assisted the tie-breaker with a corner kick which was then headed into the goal by Paulinho. Then in the 90th minute, with only overtime left in the game, Neymar got in a scuffle with Uruguay defender Walter Gargano, at which point he suddenly took a dive to feign a foul (edited footage shown below). Neymar developed a reputation for diving from other players thanks to that game[1][3][6] and others.  On October 25th, 2010, a post was submitted to the /r/todayilearned[3] subreddit, which revealed that pressing the number keys 1-10 allows the user to skip to different parts of a video in 10 percent increments. Prior to being archived, the post gained over 4,200 up votes and 250 comments. On the following day, the /r/todayilearned post was featured on the technology blog Lifehacker.[4] The practice of inhaling alcohol to get drunk quicker was first reported in 2004 as an emerging trend in the American and British nightlife scenes with the introduction of liquid nebulizers known as Alcohol Without Liquid (AWOL) devices. The earliest known video demonstration of smoking alcohol was uploaded by YouTuber Jmersh on January 4th, 2007. In the video, Jmersh shares an alternative method by pouring alcoholic beverage over dry ice and inhaling it directly. However, in the following years, the trend quickly waned as AWOL devices became banned from many regions. Then on January 19th, 2013, YouTuber "skippy62able" uploaded a seven-minute video clip in which he demonstrates how to vaporize alcohol using a plastic bottle and a bicycle pump with a cork attached to it. He repeats the process eight times with various alcoholic drinks and mixtures. As of June 25th, 2013, the video has garnered over 2.7 million views and over 21,000 likes. The first appearance of the term "Yowane Haku" was November 14th, 2007, and it was a mere joke by an anonymous user in a thread for Hatsune Miku in /mascot/ board in the Japanese text board community 2channel.[2] The word is a pun for "Hatsune Miku" and a Japanese "Yowane [Negative Words/Thoughts or Complaining] (wo) Haku [Utter/Say]", literaly means "Show the White Feather". It expresses a state of mind of the people who can't make the full use of Hatsune Miku even after they bought the software inspired by well-made Vocaloid songs on the web. Translation On November 21st, 2007, Yowane Haku was reborn as a character by a Japanese amatuer illustrator CAFFEIN. He posted illustrations to his web site[3] and pixiv[4][5], which were gijinka version of the term based on additional personalities coming from other anonymous user's posts. Translation According to Redditor Cosmoviking,[5] Santana would often play the LoL champion character Heimerdinger, whom he initially nicknamed "donger." Santana subsequently used the phrase "dongsquad" as a password for his subscribers, which fans began spamming in Twitch TV along with the code-term "420", in a similar vein to the expression "420 blaze it".  The original image came from the cover of the album "Ma Gangsta"[1] by the rap group Beantown Mafia.[2] The first known image macros were posted in a compilation to Reddit[3] in a thread that reached the front page on January 21st, 2011 and received 8,607 up votes prior to being archived. A commenter in the Reddit thread identified the young man in the photo as Blake Boston, also known as "Weezy B." In an interview with Know Your Meme, Blake revealed that the picture was originally taken by his mother.  The original video is Are You an 8-Bit Video Game Fan? by Chris Pirillo, posted the 12th june 2009, he is testing the 50 in 1 console by dream Gear, which is an game controller/console hybrid system that contains 50 8-Bit games, that can be connected directly to the TV. He tells that it costs 13$, and then he dances on the main menu's music. On June 11th, 2013, Rhode Island-based blogger Clara Beyer[2] tweeted[3] (shown below, left) an idea for a single-topic Twitter feed called “feminist Taylor Swift.” The next morning, Beyer created the account @feministtswift[1] and tweeted a parody of lyrics from Swift’s 2009 hit "You Belong With Me" (shown below). Within five days, it had been retweeted more than 4,400 times and favorited nearly 1,900 times. She wears short skirts / I wear t-shirts / Neither of us is asking for it The image was initially used in health articles about excessive sweating.[2] On September 30th, 2011, the illustration was posted in a thread on the /v/ (video games) board on 4chan[1], in which an anonymous user told a green text story using the sweating man drawing (shown below). In the post, the sweating towel guy is meant to represent the feeling of anxiety felt by a guy awkwardly trying to leave a Gamestop store.  On April 21st, 2012, Tumblr user familyfriendlyurl[2] posted an animated GIF of a dancing green alien captioned with the phrase “when u Mom com home and make hte spagheti.” As of June 20th, 2013, the post has more than 98,000 notes. The dancing alien GIF[3] has been used online since the 1990s in banner ads for mortgage loan services.[1]  In the 1987 film Lethal Weapon, Homicide Sergeant Roger Murtaugh repeatedly says the memorable quote "I'm getting too old for this shit" when faced with dangerous and frustrating circumstances while on the job after recently celebrating his 50th birthday. One of the earliest known uses of "that guy" in a pejorative manner appeared in the 1994 college comedy film PCU.[7] En route to see a concert, James 'Droz' Andrews (played by Jeremy Piven) explains to Gutter (played by Jon Favreau) that wearing the shirt of the band they were going to see would make him "that guy." In 2002, this was included as one of Buddyhead's Rules for Audiences of Rock[8], who noted that if you are the show to begin with, it is already clear you like the band and do not need to reemphasize that with a shirt. The Feminist Ryan Gosling[1] Tumblr blog was launched by writer Danielle Henderson on October 8th, 2011, featuring "feminist theory flashcards from your favorite sensitive movie dude-turned-meme." According to the blogger's FAQ page, Henderson started the Tumblr as a humorous way to keep track of the feminism and gender study theorists she was studying at the University of Wisconsin. The series was inspired by the fanmade Tumblr site FuckYeahRyanGosling[10], one of the earliest "Fuck Yeah" Tumblrs that has been curating images of the actor captioned with innocent "Hey Girl" pick up lines since 2008.  According to the blog “Unknown History of Misandry,”[1] the earliest known use of the term can be found in a review for the anonymously written novel Blanche Seymour in an 1871 issue The Spectator magazine: "We cannot, indeed, term her an absolute misandrist, as she fully admits the possibility, in most cases at least, of the reclamation of men from their naturally vicious and selfish state, though at the cost of so much trouble and vexation of spirit to women, that it is not quite clear whether she does not regard their existence as at best a mitigated evil." According to Google cache, the Tripod-hosted website Misandry Today[3] was launched as early as February 1996, which featured lists of notable quotes by feminists and general social conventions that may be perceived as being discriminatory against men.  In August of 2009, the single topic Tumblr[1] blog “Obama is Literally Hitler” was launched, which featured photographs of Barack Obama juxtaposed with Adolf Hitler to illustrate tenuous similarities (shown below). As of June 2013, the blog has since removed all published posts.   At the end of Episode 10, Season 1 in My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, Swarm of the Century,[1] Princess Celestia receives a welcome from the Mane 6 in the form of a bow. When Twilight Sparkle stands back up, she can be seen with the scrunched face (shown below). The video game Wii Fit was released for the Nintendo Wii console on December 1st, 2007, featuring a female virtual personal trainer that guides the player through various exercises. On June 11th, 2013, Nintendo announced that the franchise-crossover fighting game Super Smash Bros. for the 3DS and Wii U consoles would launch in 2014 during their presentation at the E3 conference. In the reveal trailer, the Wii Fit personal trainer was presented as a new playable character (shown below). The original clip art of the formally attired sloth was illustrated by Portland-based graphic designer Ryan Berkley.[2] The earliest known pairing of the Sloth and the Wu Tang Clan lyrics "dolla dolla bill y'all"[5] was submitted by Redditor jermtheworm on September 1st, 2011. The post was met by a modest sum of 240 up votes prior to being archived. Hachune Miku first appeared in a video parody of Loituma Girl, which was first uploaded to Japanese video sharing service Nico Nico Douga (NND) on September 4th, 2007.[2] The Vocaloid version of levan Polkka was composed by Otomania[3], Japanese music creator and flash animator who was previously well known on 2channel. The redrawn moe version of Miku was done by Japanese flash animator Tamago (たまご).[4] On September 11th, 2007, Otomania announced in a blog post that they decided to call her "Hachune Miku,"[5] as "Hachune" is a childish mispronunciation of "Hatsune." During the Nintendo Direct broadcast at 2013’s Electronic Entertainment Expo, a promotional trailer for the Super Smash Brothers Wii U and 3DS games was revealed. The trailer, which begins with the Animal Crossing Villager opening his mailbox and discovering a letter sealed with the Super Smash Brothers logo, shows the character attacking Mario with an insect net, alongside the two additional characters Capcom’s Mega Man and Nintendo’s Wii Fit Trainer.   While the phrase has been used as an English idiom to introduce one's pet peeve since as early as 1987 in the comedy film Planes, Trains & Automobiles,[13] its online popularity can be largely attributed to a gag featured in the 2005 direct-to-DVD animated film Family Guy Presents Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story. In the film, Peter Griffin hosts a local access news program titled “You Know What Really Grinds My Gears,” in which he complains about things and people that irk him, including Lindsay Lohan, people who lived in the 19th century, and the lack of new jokes about priests and rabbis. The gag is a parody of the 1976 satirical film Network[2] that follows the story of a newscaster whose on-air rant causes ratings to skyrocket and ultimately save his job. The earliest known variation of the phrase was posted to the Wireplay Forums[2] on January 2, 1999, when user Pokey submitted a thread titled “You know you’ve been playing too much Unreal when…” to discuss some of the most commonly observed behaviors associated with players of the first person shooter video game Unreal Tournament. The original image comes from a scene in the movie Dodgeball in which ESPN8 sportscaster Cotton McKnight (played by Gary Michael Cole) announces that one of the finalist teams has forfeited the championship, to which his co-announcer Pepper Brooks (played by Jason Bateman) responds by calling the decision a “bold strategy” (shown below). "It's a bold strategy Cotton. Let's see if it pays off for him." On February 25th, 2012, a Quickmeme[2] page titled "Bold Move Cotton" was created, which featured a screen captured image from the Dodgeball scene. In the first 16 months, the page accumulated over 680 submissions.   The line was uttered by the protagonist Bilbo Baggins (played by Martin Freeman) early on in the film after deciding to join Gandalf (played by Ian McKellen) and a group of dwarves on their quest to reclaim Erabor from Smaug. Known for keeping to himself, Baggins says the line to a farmer who inquires about his haste as he runs through Hobbiton. The scene was first revealed in a trailer made available online in September 2012.[2]  The Litterati movement originally began as a personal Instagram project by Jeff Kirschner[4], who was inspired by his environmentally conscious daughter to start a voluntary street-cleaning campaign using the crowdsource model. On August 13th, 2012, Kirschner posted his first two #literatti images[8] of a water bottle cap and an empty beverage bottle via Instagram. On May 2nd, 2013, one of Hofman’s 54-foot high yellow inflatable ducks was launched in Hong Kong’s Victoria Harbor (shown below, left). On May 15th, the sculpture mysteriously deflated (shown below, right), which resulted in the hashtag “#bigyellowduck” rising to the top searched keyword on the Chinese microblogging and social networking site Weibo.[2] Sina Weibo user Weiblog[7] subsequently posted a photoshopped version of the 1989 photograph “Tank Man”[3] (shown below, left) from the Tiananmen Square protests, in which the tanks were replaced with the large duck sculptures (shown below, right). Leading up to the anniversary of the protests on June 4th, several words were censored on Sina Weibo, including “1989,” “In today,” “anniversary” and “big yellow duck."  The first Ratboy Genius video was uploaded to YouTube on July 23rd, 2007. The video was the first chapter in the Ratboy Kingdom series, describing the absurd events of the character's every day life. The video places the animated characters over on scenic photographs, depicting Ratboy Genius turning into a fish and going for a swim. As of June 2013, the video has more than 14,000 views. On May 4th, 2013, two young men from the state of Veracruz set up a Facebook fan page for their cat under the pseudonym "candigatomorris". According to a Mural interview[1], one of the owners who works as a graphic designer used the fanpage to publish some propaganda for the campaign, including some stickers pasted on citizens' cars. The objective of this propaganda was to mock Mexican politicians and their campaigns, pointing out their laziness and distance from the people, and that anybody can make the vague promises they make. The fan page has since been used to promote campaigns against animal cruelty, and to spread public denouncements about current government actions. Some of the more notable campaign slogans include: On December 12th, 2012, the Prancercise YouTube channel uploaded a video titled "Prancercise: A Fitness Workout," which featured Rohrback performing various dance moves while walking down a pathway in a park. As of June 2013, the video has received over five million views and 200 comments. While it was first used for certain transformers fans on TFArchive, it is uncertain when or where the term for pokemon fans was first used, it was referenced on DeviantArt[2] as early as March 4th, 2012 in an image of the first generation character Charizard with the caption “Stealth Rock.” Introduced in the Generation IV games, Stealth Rock[3] is a move which causes the opponent's Pokémon to take damage upon entering the battle. The damage taken is based on the Pokémon's weakness/resistance to Rock-type moves. Because Charizard is Fire/Flying, and thus 4x weak to Rock, Stealth Rock causes it to lose 50% of its total health upon switching in. Because Charizard is a favorite of Genwunners, the image is meant to annoy them by pointing out Charizard's flaws. In the description, creator KKtheProphet explained that the image was representative of people who were tired of Genwunners arguing the first 151 Pokemon are the best. The first known video depicting a cat fighting with a printer was uploaded to YouTube on April 23rd, 2006 by Azahara Carreras León. The video depicts her cat Marcus attacking a HP Deskjet printer as it prints, violently ripping up the paper. As of June 2013, the video has been viewed more than 1.8 million times.  Marcos Castro proposed the meme in a video of his channel,the vlog "Idiotices", what mean Stupidities. The trigger of this fad was posted by Twitter user おーきぽょ (@2525_1919)[1] on April 27th, 2013[2], which depicted a young male jumping in the air, appearing as if he was about to jump on to the back of the person in the foreground. This tweet had earned over 4,800 retweets and 2,000 favs in its first month. Besides, the name of this photo fad "Shingeki no Koyjin Gokko" was coined by this tweet. 進撃の巨人ごっこしたよ twitter.com/2525_1919/stat… “Fan service”[7] is a term originating from anime and manga fandom used to describe material that involves racy, sexual or erotic content added solely to please the audience. Various anime series have gained a reputation for focusing on fan service and placing less emphasis on the story. In this context, “watching it for the plot” is used as a tongue-in-cheek excuse for those who watch a show for fan service but the exact origin of the phrase is unknown. The fad began with the launch of the single topic blog Baguette Me Nots[4] on October 8th, 2012, which was started by Tim Bierbaum[1] and John Milhiser[2] of the Brooklyn-based sketch comedy group Serious Lunch.[3] That day, the bloggers posted 12 photos of people carrying out everyday tasks, such as weightlifting (shown below, left), watering the lawn (shown below, center) and shaving (shown below, right), with baguettes instead of ordinary objects and tools that are more appropriate in context. Calne Ca was created by 3D CG artist and sculptor Kotaro Maeda (前田幸太郎) also known as Deino.[3] The first illustration to feature Calne Ca was uploaded to pixiv on March 15th, 2009[4] previewing a model Deino was working on for an upcoming music video. The music video was uploaded to Deino's Nico Nico Douga (NND) account on July 2nd, 2009 (shown below, left); it was for the song "Machine Muzik" by Ding Saya (鼎沙耶).[5] A day later a music video with only a few illustrations and some limited animation was released for "Corpse Attack!" by Utsu-P (鬱P) on Utsu-P's NND channel (shown below, right).[6] According to illustrations for explaining Calne Ca's character settings which were later uploaded by Deino[7][8], she is essentially a robotic female skeleton named Calcium (シーエ)[9] cosplaying Hatsune Miku or sometimes other Vocaloid or Utauloid characters. She has interchangeable parts and her "skin" is a casing that's as much a part of the cosplay as her clothing so her appearance can vary from skeletal, to cybernetic (her most common appearance), to insectoid, to human. She almost always has a stylized wharf roach named "Sodium Sulfite", usually called by the nickname "Nato-kun" (ナトくん)[10], living on top of her head.   On May 1st, 2012, YouTuber kawnra replied to a faux-instructional video demonstrating how to touch an apple to a wall with the following comment: “The instructions weren’t clear enough. I got my dick caught in the ceiling fan.” Within the next year, the comment received over 14,200 up votes. On October 26th, 2012, FunnyJunk[1] user pocoloco submitted two photographs of a chihuahua in a post titled "creepy chihuahua is pleased" (shown below, left), which gained over 28,600 views and 990 up votes in the following seven months. On February 25th, 2013, an edited version of the photo with the caption "Do she got a booty / she doooo" (shown below, right) was posted via Twitter[3] by user @robbybeackman.  The dog was originally showcased towards the end of the Xbox One reveal conference[1] on May 21st, 2013. During Activision's presentation of Call of Duty: Ghosts, an exclusive title for the upcoming console, they briefly revisited a canine character from Modern Warfare 3 before introducing the latest canine character as "a member of the team" who aids by sniffing out dangers throughout the missions. The dog was rendered with motion capture technology and modeled after a former member of the Navy SEAL K9 squad. The announcement quickly became a subject of parodies on Twitter, with video-game blog Kotaku[2] editor Kirk Hamilton[3] stating that the announcement of in-game dogs arrived shortly after the developers stated that they wanted to do "the right thing". "We didn't want to do the safe thing, we wanted to do the RIGHT thing," says guy making the new Call of Duty, before revealing in-game dogs This is originally from the SBS comedy series, Fat Pizza season 2 episode 7, 'Freaky Pizza'. The Ronnie McDoggle scenes were uploaded to Youtube on October 20, 2012. (Not a Youtube Poop) Ronnie McDoggle scenes in G-Major A Reverse Video Ronnie McDoggle has a rivalry with Ronald McDonald. More Video Examples The Scene was originally from the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Season 1 episode, 'A Pig Surprise' in 1994. YTPooperGuy has uploaded the original scene in October 27, 2012. Soon in November 24, 2012, Another video has been uploaded by YTPooperGuy. These are the remade examples. A Video in Reverse. Some Various Youtube Poops   The origin of the meme is unknown. However, while the origin could not be confirmed, based on the drawing, it's likely that the earliest version of the meme was "Hide Jewish Posts" (shown below, left). The earliest available version was posted on September 24th, 2012 by an anonymous 4chan user in the /jp/ board (shown below, right).[1] Throwback has been associated with things that are deemed classic or vintage since as early as 2003, when it was first defined on Urban Dictionary.[1] The earliest known mention of "Throwback Thursday" can be found in the title of a series of revamped retro cartoon characters that were illustrated by animator Saxton Moore and uploaded onto his blog[2] in January 2006 (shown below). Prior to being used as an advice animal, the photograph of the young man was initially featured in acne-related articles online as early as May of 2010 (shown below, left).[1] On May 10th, 2012, Redditor NewNormal submitted an image macro titled "Introducing Old Economy Steven… you know, your dad" to the /r/AdviceAnimals[2] subreddit, which featured the same photograph paired with the caption "Fails out of high school / Gets job, buys house, retires happy" (shown below, right). Prior to being archived, the post received over 10,600 up votes and 950 comments. The earliest known use of the phrase in a reaction image can be found in an animated GIF uploaded by DeviantArtist[4] hprince329 on June 11th, 2003. Titled “Hahaha – NO," the image shows a small laughing emoticon that abruptly turns into a serious face (shown below). The meme was first appropriated from MGoBlog, a Michigan fan blog whose author, Brian Cook, supposed the existence of an "Angry Michigan Safety Hating God" in 2005 to explain the multitudinous injuries to University of Michigan safeties. Cook also made mention of the Michigan Safety Hating God on the Blogpoll (a ranking system that uses votes from top college football bloggers around the country) then written by Cook for AOL Fanhouse). Several early mentions of this proto-deity were made on MGoBlog around the time of the 2005 Michigan-Iowa game, in which Michigan was forced to burn the redshirt of cornerback Brandon Harrison to fill the now-empty safety depth chart. Adam Jacobi, founder of the Iowa blog Black Heart Gold Pants, began to apply similar wording to describe the far more extensive history of injuries that plagued Iowa running backs since 2001, specifically in reference to supposed starting running back Shonn Greene's perpetual difficulties in remaining eligible in light of potential backups Kalvin Bailey and Corey Robinson both leaving the school for academic reasons. Cook and Jacobi became a sounding board for the meme, with Jacobi and his readers using it on BHGP, and Cook publishing those mentions on his weekly Fanhouse column (also since moved to SBNation) "This Week in Schadenfreude."  The phenomenon was discussed as early as December 5th, 2009 on Yahoo! Answers[4], where an anonymous user asked why people simply quote a post and add “this” underneath it. The question only received one answer, which suggested that the person did not finish what they were typing. The game of bingo[1] can be traced back to approximately the year 1530 with the Italian lottery game "Il Giuoco del Lotto d'Italia". Over the course of the next few centuries, the game was eventually co-opted by the French in the late 18th century. Bingo reached the web in the mid 1990s through virtual game rooms on Bingo Zone[11] and Pogo (shown below, left).[12] In 1995, the derivative game Slingo[13] (shown below, right) launched, replacing the traditional bingo format of calling one number at a time with randomization inspired by slot machines. Although it is unknown when bingo cards first became customized using words and phrases instead of numbers, custom bingo generators were created on the web as early as February 1st, 2001.[2][3] On October 25th, 2011, photographer Beth Saravo uploaded a photograph of a dog looking out a car window titled "Majestic as Fuck" to her Flickr[1] account (shown below). On October 3rd, 2011, a photograph of a casually attired young male protester with a sign which revealed the outfit was the same one he was wearing when he was raped was posted the official SlutWalk NYC Tumblr.[6] The photo was taken that day at the SlutWalk[7]protest held in Union Square against victim-blaming, slut shaming and rape culture. According to a post on The Slut Project[8], the image was captured by photographer Francesa June. Though its original post has been deleted, the photo has more than 35,000 notes on Tumblr as of May 2013. [image: A teenaged boy at Slutwalk NYC. He has short pink hair and is wearing jeans and baggy grey tshirt. His jeans are ripped at the knee, but are otherwise unremarkable, and his tshirt has some sort of maroon logo. He is looking directly at the camera, and holding a large white sign. His sign reads: THIS IS WHAT I WAS WEARING. TELL ME I ASKED FOR IT. I DARE YOU.] On April 10th, 2013, Gucci Mane appeared in court where he was indicted for assaulting a military soldier with a champagne bottle.[3] On April 17th, Redditor hellpony submitted a photoshopped screenshot of a local news report to the /r/Funny[2] subreddit, which changed the on-screen text to read "Rapper Gucci Mane responds with 'bitch I might be' when asked if guilty" (shown below), referencing a lyric from his 2006 single Pillz."[1] Within one month, the post accrued more than 10,300 upvotes and 360 comments. As early as 1996, the phrase “laughing ’til my sides hurt” (LTMSH) was included on a list of internet acronyms.[1] By October 27th, 2000, “my sides” had begun to appear in comments to express how hard someone laughed at a post, as seen in the comments section of a blog post listing 50 ways to get kicked out of a mall (shown below).[2]  The earliest known example of a "cat beard" photo was uploaded by Tumblr user Catasters on July 28th, 2011, depicting a man touching noses with his tabby cat (shown below). Two days later, Catasters' image was submitted to the /r/pics subreddit, receiving nearly a thousand up votes. In the following days, the same image was featured on a number of internet humor blogs, including Neatorama[3], Tastefully Offensive[4], Buzzfeed[5], and the Huffington Post[6]. On March 29th, 2012, Ahmed Angel began uploading photographs of himself to his profile on the Russian social networking site VK[6] (shown below).  The term originated on 4chan's /v/ (video games) board by hardcore gamers who view people who play casual games in a negative light. The first archived use of the term[2] was posted on August 30th, 2008 in a parody thread about how an average discussion plays out on the board. The phrase "Choo Choo Motherfucker" was used on 4chan since as early as March 25th, 2009 when it was used in a thread on /a/[1] (Anime and Manga). While discussing a leaked image of Link in a conductor suit from the game The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks[2], a user criticized the choice of including a train aspect to the game.  The fan character was created by pixiv user Ryūsei (リューセイ)[1] on February 2nd, 2010.[2] The drawing was originally titled “Mikku Miku ni Shiteyanyo,” a parody of the lyrics from the Vocaloid song “Miku Miku ni Site Ageru” (みくみくにしてあげる♪).[3] In a scene in The Dark Knight, the Joker disguises himself as a nurse to meet with the character Two-Face while he is in the hospital. Upon visiting him, the Joker mocks how differently the citizens of Gotham react to his threats of violence depending on who the targeted victim is (shown below). "If, tomorrow, I tell the press that, like, a gang banger will get shot, or a truckload of soldiers will be blown up, nobody panics, because it's all 'part of the plan'. But when I say that one little old mayor will die, well then everyone loses their minds!" On April 14th, 2012, a Quickmeme[1] page titled "Joker Mind Loss" was launched, featuring a screen captured image from the scene accompanied by various captions ending with the phrase "everyone loses their minds!" "Late Night with Conan O'Brien" aired a well loved [1] skit called "Satellite Channels" featuring "a channel that's called "Not Cool, Zeus"" wherein Zeus (played by Matt Walsh [2]), the Greek god and master of Olympus, eats his roommate's burrito, sweats on gym equipment without toweling it off, and cannonball's into a pool getting two people wet.  The earliest known use of the phrase "horror movie logic" online can be found in a review for the 1999 horror film The Blair Witch Project posted on the Wiccan blog Witchvox[1] on November 5th, 2000. In the review, a scene where it is revealed that the protagonists failed to back up their research is referred to as "horror movie logic": "With delicious horror movie logic, we learn they didn't back up their research on the computer: their only copy now lies strewn around the forest floor." On September 30th, 2010, Sputnik Music Forums[5] member Tyler created a thread titled "Repost this is you are a beautiful strong crack whore who don't need no man," which received over 5,000 responses in the following year. In 2011, Tumblr user brave-neville posted (broken link) a image with the caption: “And now, a poem by Tom Riddle :) Roses are red. Violets are blue Avada Kedavra!! I love you <3” This image has been reposted by a number of other Tumblr users (see sources). In April 2012, it has appeared slightly changed in Desmotivaciones.es. The following month, some Facebook pages of Brazil started to make variations of this comic and spread the format that it becomes popular. On May 9th, 2013, Time Magazine[1] released the cover for their upcoming issue titled "The Me Me Me Generation," featuring a photograph of a young woman taking a picture of herself with an iPhone (shown below). "Millennials are lazy, entitled narcissists who still live with their parents. Why they’ll save us all.” According to a Buzzfeed[1] interview, Princess Monster Truck was found by New York City-based artists Tracy Timmons and Joseph Bryce[2] on the streets of Brooklyn. They led the cat to their home, where they cleaned her up and decided to keep her as their pet. Timmins began posting photos of the cat to her personal Instagram account[3] (shown below, left) on December 12th, 2012. On April 9th, 2013, they launched a separate account[4] just for the cat. As of May 13th, 2013, Princess Monster Truck has more than 8,1000 Instagram followers.  Though nail art[1] has been part of high fashion for decades, it has been discussed online since as early as 1994, beginning in the alt.fashion newsgroup. One of the earliest discussion threads was posted on May 2nd, 1994 by a student named Lisa at Michigan State University. The post[2] discussed airbrushed nail art (example shown below) that is available for people who used acrylic-based extensions for their nails. The exact origin of carved pencil art is unknown, though some of the early pioneers include Brazilian artist Dalton Ghetti, who began carving pencils as early as 1986 according to his website’s bio page,[1] and Japanese artist Mizuta Tasogare, who created a honeycomb-patterned pencil sculpture (shown below) in the fall of 1987, as featured in the JAD Project Internet Museum.[2] On November 21st, 2011, Tumblr user Char the Butcher[1] made a post containing a photo showing off a tattoo that reads "Die Cis Scum" (shown below). In the post, Char explains they got the tattoo the previous day in honor of the annual Transgender Day of Remembrance, a day to memorializes those killed as a result of transphobia. The phrase was chosen as a way to highlight the continuing violence endured by the trans community, and to express the blogger's feelings of fear and worry about walking around in public.  On July 15th, 2009, K.C. Green released the eighth issue of his webcomic series The Anime Club,[1] which featured a panel showing the character Mark calling his friend Mort a "dense motherfucker" for purchasing an infected anime DVD (shown below).    The original video with singers Miku and Luka was uploaded onto Nico Nico Douga (NND) on May 1st, 2009[2] by user Ryūsei-P (流星P), with an illustration by Yunomi-P (ゆのみP). The video reached great popularity, and was uploaded onto YouTube on the same day. As of this writing the YouTube broadcast has over 2 million views. In May of 2009, this song was also included in Ryūsei-P's second indie album with the same title released in Doujin market. Comic Sans MS was created in October of 1994 by Vincent Connare[15] for Microsoft. The font was inspired by the lettering found in comic books Connare kept in his office, specifically Alan Moore's Watchmen[1] and Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns.[8] It was originally intended to be used solely in children's programs after Connare saw a beta version of an interface called Microsoft Bob[16] (shown below, right), which used a Times New Roman typeface in a comic-style setting.[19] However, the font was not completed in time to be used in the program. Instead, Microsoft used Comic Sans in pop-up windows and the help section of the 1995 program 3D Movie Maker[17] before it was included in Windows 95 Plus! Pack as one of the standard fonts.[2] Microsoft[18] describes Comic Sans as a “groovy script font." Cowboy Bebop[1] is a sci-fi action anime created by Japanese animation studio Sunrise[2] in 1998. Set in the year 2071, the series details the lives of four bounty hunters whose dark pasts are revealed as the story progresses. The title animation was inspired by the aesthetics of the 1966 film Tokyo Drifter[6] and the pop art of the 1950s – 60s[7], using squares and rectangles of various sizes with the silhouettes of the main characters. The theme song "Tank!"[4] was composed by Yoko Kanno and performed by her jazz band, the Seatbelts.[3] The song is mainly instrumental, utilizing a double bass and bongo drums for a Latin flavor, except for one line of lyrics spoken by Tim Jensen. One of the earliest parodies of the Cowboy Bebop opening theme was uploaded to the Newgrounds[9] Flash portal on November 10th, 2002, which was originally designed as a Flash-based introduction to the now-defunct website Fantasy Realm.    #FollowATeen[18] was first proposed by Something Awful writer David Thorpe via Twitter in late December 2011, who suggested that adults on Twitter should follow teenagers to get a perspective on modern teen life. Your twitter feed isn't complete unless you follow a random teen and just enjoy their little teen life. #followateen   The cap was first introduced through the Workaholics[1] character Adam DeMamp (played by Adam Devine[2]) in an episode titled "Stop! Pajama Time" (Episode 6, Season 2), aired on October 25th, 2011. In the episode, DeMamp wears a baseball cap that reads "Top Gun" on the front, which he claims to have won for being the "top sales gun of the month" to his coworkers, though it is quickly revealed that he had just purchased it at a convenience store. DeMamp's hat is referenced several times throughout the episode and was also mentioned on the show's official Tumblr blog[4] prior to the broadcast. On Aprul 29th, 2013, RhettandLink uploaded a commercial titled "Shift It," featuring footage of Arlen's Transmission in Pasadena, California (shown below). Within one week, the video surpassed 2.39 million views and 4,500 comments. In the early 1990s, Apple Inc. released a promotional video for its Macintosh and Apple II products. In the video, a young boy identified as Brent Rambo is shown nodding at a computer monitor while narrating a letter to Apple CEO John Sculley[8] (shown below). Brent Rambo: "Dear Mr. Scully, Mac rules the world. Your Mac friend, Brent Rambo" The earliest known usage of the scene as a meme was published by Redditor[13] phracker in the /r/mac subreddit. The post, entitled "'Nuff said," received more than 260 points (86% upvoted) as of February 2020 (shown below). In the video game Metal Gear Rising, the final boss character Senator Armstrong is confronted by the game’s protagonist as to why he cannot be killed, to which he responds “Nanomachines, son” (shown below). The phrase is meant to indicate that he is using nanotechnology to armor himself and achieve invulnerability Raiden: Why won't you die? Senator Armstrong: Nanomachines, son!  In the November 2nd, 1995 Seinfeld episode "The Soup Nazi"[1], the main characters check out a local soup shop with an incredibly strict chef (played by Larry Thomas[6]) who is nicknamed "Soup Nazi" for his rules about ordering. After Elaine Benes (played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus) attempts to subvert his ordering procedure, the chef utters the statement, banning her from the shop for an entire year. Thomas' character was inspired by a real-life soup vendor named Ali "Al" Yeganeh[16] whose Manhattan restaurant, Soup Kitchen International, had been notorious for having strict ordering rules[17] since 1984. The scene originated from episode 41a The Algae's Always Greener of season 3 where Mr. Krabs leaves the Krusty Krab in defeat for Spongebob (and soon after) the entire Krusty Krab to let out a "victory screech".[1] It all started on a Brazilian television show called "Vox Populi". Caetano Veloso was there answering several questions. In one of the questions, a reporter asked a question about the military regime in Brazil and Caetano replied repeating several times that "he was stupid". The interview was first aired in 1978. In 1997, the Star Wars Trilogy Special Edition was released to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Star Wars Episode 4: A New Hope. George Lucas, the director of the Star Wars series, made several changes to the original trilogy while remastering it. Most of these changes were aesthetic, however one scene that was changed was the confrontation between Han Solo and Greedo, a bounty hunter sent by Jabba the Hut, in Mos Eisley Cantina. In the original 1977 release, Han shoots Greedo under the table while Greedo is pointing his blaster at him. In the altered 1997 version however, Greedo shots at Han first and misses, and then proceeds to be shot by Han in a small scene that was not present in the 1977 version. The original photograph of Nashville, Tennessee resident Adam Holland posing with his drawing was taken during an art class for mentally disabled students at Vanderbilt University in 2004.[9] However, the image didn't gain notoriety until in 2006, when a page titled “Retarded Handicap Sign Generator”[3] was launched to allow users to customize the text in the sign (shown below, right). On June 11th, 2012, Redditor HomeButton submitted a post titled “Mad Karma with Jim Cramer” to the /r/AdviceAnimals[1] subreddit, which featured a screenshot of Cramer hosting Mad Money with the headline news ticker edited to list trending memes on Reddit instead of stock quotes. The image macro was captioned with "Dump all your karma in pictures of feet" (shown below), referencing a foot photograph post that had reached the front page the day before.[2] Prior to being archived, the post received over 4,300 up votes and 100 comments. One of the first known name generators was built in C++ and shared on the fantasy roleplay enthusiast Usenet group net.games.frp[9] on April 1st, 1983. The program would generate a list of 20 words inspired by Sindarin[10], the fictitious language created by J. R. R. Tolkien for his series The Lord of the Rings, that could be used as names for characters, places, weapons and other things in role playing games. The Mentos campaign launched in the early 1990s with the slogan "The Freshmaker," depicting young people solving problems in a quirky manner.[3] The campaign was incredibly successful, helping sales rise from $20 million to $40 milion in three years.[5] Rock band Foo Fighters was the first to parody these commercials in their 1996 music video for the song "Big Me" (shown below), poking fun at the campaign's overwhelming optimism.[6] On October 3rd, 2000, a post titled "Nice Things That Restore my Faith in Humanity" was submitted to the writing database Everything2[7] by user Nailbunny, which featured a short story about a heartfelt phone call from a close friend. According to the Wikipedia,[1] the earliest known use of the expression with its current meaning was uttered by British politician and orator John Bright when referring to the Reform Act of 1867, which called for a more democratic representation in Parliament. In an speech describing his attempt to peak the Parliament's interest, he compared it to the act of flogging a dead horse to make it pull a load. On March 24th, 2000, an email regarding the phrase "beating a dead horse" was posted on the website Phrases,[4] which cited the origin as John Bright's speech regarding Parliament. On April 27th, 2013, Redditor Notmiefault submitted an image macro titled “Confession Kid” to the /r/AdviceAnimals[2] subreddit, recollecting how he used to believe as a child that automatic doors were controlled by an unseen person viewing a surveillance camera (shown below).    The deviantART user Rafe15 has a collection of such pictures that can be dated back to 2010. The earliest instance of such pictures was titled "A very different Jake", featuring a character Jake from 1990 Disney animated film The Rescuers Down Under[1]. It was uploaded on June 10, 2010. Pay attention to the following description.  On December 6th, 2009, the Internet news blog BoingBoing[1] published a post titled "Just look at this awesome banana slicer," which linked to the Amazon[2] page for the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer. The product page remained relatively unknown until March 2nd, 2011, when the first satirical review was submitted by Amazon user elven, who lauded the product by comparing it to the Honey Badger and Charlie Sheen. "I can't believe I have wasted the first 35 years of my existence on this earth by not having this wonderful banana slicer. All this time I have been standing there at the kitchen counter like a complete IDIOT wasting countless seconds slicing my bananas with a knife. A KNIFE!!!! Can you believe how foolish I was? Listen. This banana slicer will change your life. After slicing a banana, or two, or three (hell slice as many as you want – it takes no time at all)you will feel like you have honey badger blood flowing through your veins and have Charlie Sheen DNA." On March 25th, 2013, Tumblr user louwhis[1] posted a series of three Kaomoji emoticons, with the first depicting a serene character wearing a flower. The second shows the emoticon with wide eyes paired with the phrase "what you say 'bout me" while the third shows the emoticon passing the flower off to someone, paired with "hold my flower." As of April 24th, 2013, this post has more than 90,000 notes. The earliest known use of the phrase online can be found in a post titled “Childhood Ruined or Enhanced?” submitted by user QuadLife to the Internet humor site FunnyJunk[8] on August 26th, 2010. The post featured an adult-oriented alternate universe illustration of creatures from the Pokemon franchise (shown below). On April 22nd, Redditor realms_board submitted a post titled “How I picture the Australians coming on to reddit” to /r/Funny,[16] suggesting that Australian Redditors tend to take over the posts submitted by American Redditors due to differences in time zones. By the next day, the image had accrued more than 23,000 upvotes, 1,300 points and nearly 900 comments. On April 23rd, 2013, Redditor lefoss submitted an image post titled “Team Ameristralia, with our powers combined….” to /r/AdviceAnimals,[1] which depicted a koala riding an eagle with the caption “We will rule Reddit by day and by night.” Within 19 hours, the post accrued more than 21,000 upvotes, 1,100 comments and nearly 1,700 points overall. Prior to this post, the portmanteau had been used in a discussion thread about American expats living in Australia on the Family Based Immigration forums[2] in December 2010. On April 8th, 2013, YouTuber MisterEpicMann[1] uploaded a video showing two men seated at a table sharing a meal, with one of them performing an interpretive dance to show how different species of animals eat while the other sits quietly, unaffected. In just four days, the video reached 7 million views.[12] Within the first two weeks, the video accrued nearly 47.5 million views on YouTube and 3.5 million shares on Facebook.[2]   On February 16th, 2013, an anonymous user of 4chan's /tv/[1] board posted an image of comedy magician Penn Jillette's photograph along with a greentext story about being a job recruiter, looking at a resume that lists "cinema or TV shows" under the "hobbies" section, and throws the resume out, illustrated by the phrase, "into the trash it goes" (shown below). This is the earliest known post using the phrase. The post inspired numerous others following the same format of uploading an image of Penn Jillette (often the same photograph, but not always) and writing a greentext story about looking at a resume with something undesirable or cringeworthy on it, ending each with a variation of the phrase "into the trash it goes" (examples from March 2013 shown below).[3][4] The character was originally conceived as an alter ago name for Tumblr user Kitchiki, who was given the name "Moon Moon" by a name generator titled "What is Your Werewolf Name? (shown below).[1] On April 5th, Kitchiki noted the silliness of the result in response to the original image post, which gained more than 158,000 notes in the first two weeks. The term is derived from a mispronunciation of "video" that was uttered in the March 1st, 1998 episode of adult animated sitcom King of the Hill.[1] Throughout the series (shown below), the protagonist Hank Hill continues to pronounces the word "video" as "vidya" reflecting his Texan accent.[6]  Though its exact origin is unknown, the term has been used since as early as July 2012, when the Facebook fan page Mundo De Princeso[14] launched with inspirational photo quote-style image macros about love and romance from the perspective of a young man in love. At the start of the episode one of the girls, Nonohara Yuzuko, says it and they realized how it rolls of the tongue extremely well and how catchy it sounds, so they start singing it. On April, 2013, the catchphrase was discussed on the 4chan /a/ board in the episode thread, with comments like: "Guys I can't stop saying nantsutte tsuchatta, help me please" or simply saying "Nantsutte tsuchatta!" On March 15th, 2010, YouTuber themcrookedvultures uploaded a video titled "Dave Grohl in FRESH POTS!", featuring several clips of Grohl yelling the phrase "fresh pots!", drinking coffee and frantically playing a variety of musical instruments (shown below). At the end of the video, a slide is shown claiming that Grohl was rushed to the hospital two weeks after the video was shot due to "unwanted physical effects caused by too much caffeine." In the next three years, the video gained over 3.75 million views and 5,500 comments. On April 9th, 2013, Detroit's web-based magazine Model D Media[2] published an op-ed article on the city's potential for economic growth, which featured a photograph of Jason Lorimer (shown below, left), founder of the philanthropic and civic consultancy firm Dandelion.[1] On April 11th, a Quickmeme[3] page titled “White Entrepreneurial Guy” was launched, with the first submission featuring the same picture of Lorimer accompanied by the caption “His new restaurant will create jobs for ‘the community’ / like bussing tables” (shown below, right). The phrase was first uttered in a scene from the science fiction film Inception in which the character Dom Cobb (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) speaks to Robert Fischer (played by Cillian Murphy) about planting a thought inside someone's mind. The film was originally released in theaters on July 8th, 2010. On July 20th, Redditor YoungCleanLegitSon submitted a post to the /r/pics[5] subreddit, featuring a vertical comic with an Xzibit Yo Dawg image macro followed by a screen capture of Cobb with the caption "We need to go deeper" (shown below). Prior to being archived, the post received over 1,300 up votes and 140 comments. The phrase "Science Bros" was coined by Tumblr blogger killianing[1] in a GIF photo set depicting various interactions between Banner and Stark posted on May 5th, 2012, following the release of the 2012 live action film based on the Marvel comic series The Avengers.  The earliest known use of the term "Hyperlapse" can be attributed to a short video project uploaded to Vimeo by Spanish filmmaker Fran Muradas on December 27th, 2008. Titled "Test Hyperlapse / Timelapse Paseo por Pontevedra," the clip shows a downtown walking tour of the city of Pontevedra in time lapsed sequence. Snickers began their "You're Not You When You're Hungry" campaign during Super Bowl XLIV in 2010, where grumpy people in troublesome situations were portrayed by celebrity actors Betty White and Abe Vigoda. Upon eating a Snickers bar provided by a concerned friend, the character is transformed and indicates that the are "better" (shown below, left). In 2012, a similar ad ran in the United Kingdom starring actress Joan Collins (shown below, right). On April 6th, 2013, Redditor Nutty_Nadim submitted a post to the /r/funny[1] subreddit titled "Kim, Eat a Snickers," featuring a multi-pane comic featuring screen captures from the United Kingdom Snickers commercial with photographs of North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un transforming into the pop star PSY (shown below). Within the first two months, the post gained over 85,000 up votes and 1,500 comments. On May 3rd, 2006, Break.com user Tommydyhr uploaded a video titled "Condom Sucking From Nose to Mouth," in which a young man snorts a condom through his nose and extracts it out of his mouth (shown below, left). In the next seven years, the video received upwards of 73,500 views and 130 comments. In the following years, several other condom snorting videos were subsequently uploaded to YouTube, but the name "condom challenge" was not coined until May 23rd, 2012, when YouTuber Isaac Mathers uploaded a video performing the same stunt titled "Condom Challenge" (shown below, right). Within one year, the video received over 9,300 views and 25 comments.  Sakura Matō (shown below, left) is one of the three main heroines in the visual novel Fate/Stay Night[1] by Type-Moon released in 2004. That year, Fate/Stay Night was the highest-selling visual novel on adult games retailer Getchu.com, resulting in a large fan following which also spread to the western web. The earliest version of the Sakurafish image was posted in a collection of images of the character[3] on the South Korean search portal Naver[5] on October 6th, 2006 (shown below, right). The watermark on the image in the post traces the creator back to Naver blogger yoow889.[4] The first archived instance of a Sakurafish thread was posted to 4chan's /a/ board on February 7th, 2008[2], as earlier threads had not been saved  Joel Osteen is the senior pastor of the Lakewood Church in Houston, Texas, where he hosts the church's television program reaching 7 million viewers in 100 countries.[17] He has written two commercially successful books, titled Your Best Life Now: 7 Steps to Living at Your Full Potential and Become a Better You: 7 Keys to Improving Your Life Every Day. Osteen is considered a reputed figure in the Christian community, having been named one of ABC News' "10 Most Fascinating People" and "Most Influential Christian in America" by The Church Report.[18][19] On April 2nd, 2013, the now-suspended fake Twitter account @PastorJoelOsten was created with its first and only tweet reading “I am leaving the Christian faith and I have resigned as pastor. Please visit our site at joelostenministries.com for more info.” The now-defunct website referenced in the tweet looked similar to Osteen’s official site but contained a message announcing his resignation as pastor. Many of their criticisms are legitimate. What they don't know is that deep down in my heart, for a number of years now, I have been questioning the faith, Christianity and whether Jesus Christ is really my, or anyone's, 'savior'. I am now at the point that I am comfortable enough in what I believe that I am ready to announce to the world that I am no longer a Christian. I am no longer a believer in Christ. I no longer believe the Bible is the word of God. I believe now that the Bible is a fallible, flawed, highly inconsistent history book that has been altered hundreds of times. There is zero evidence the Bible is the holy word of God. In fact, there is zero evidence "God" even exists. I believe I am more like God than the God of the Bible, a fictional character. Today, I informed my closest colleagues of my decision to leave the church. Our ministry will continue in a bare-bones fashion as we liquidate our assets and fulfill various financial obligations. I want to thank my wife, our parishioners and our faithful followers, the City of Houston, Lakewood, the State of Texas and my close friends, Oprah Winfrey and Larry King, for all of our support over the years We're also having some trouble transferring ownership of some of our web sites, so as of now, I haven't been able to update everything on all of them. I'm dealing with some church leaders who refuse to accept my resignation. They are refusing to change or alter any of our many web sites, and this is the only one I have control over." The same day, the ChristianityNews YouTube channel uploaded a video featuring photoshopped images of news sites reporting that Osteen had renounced his faith in Christianity (shown below). The dance is named after the ring name of American professional wrestler Curtis Jonathan Hussey, who made his debut as "Fandango" during an airing of WWE RAW on November 5th, 2012. On March 18th, 2013, Fandango made an entrance to his wrestling match while dancing to his theme song “Chachalala” originally composed by WWE composer Jim Johnston (shown below). On April 8th, Fandango's entrance at the Izod Center in East Rutherford, New Jersey was met by WWE audience members humming the tune of his theme song while pointing up their fingers. Following this event, the gesture soon became known as “Fandangoing," though it is unclear who coined the term. The earliest hallway swimming video was created by a group of music students and posted to YouTube by Joe's Untitled Web Show on May 17th, 2009. As of April 2013, the video has more than 18,500 views.   The "Sports Balls Replaced With Cats" (SBRWC) Tumblr[1] blog was launched on April 7th, 2013, with the first posted image featuring a rugby player getting tackled in mid-air while holding a small kitten (shown below).[2] Within four days, the post garnered over 40 notes. Text-based jokes using "Juan" as a pun for "one" have been shared online since as early as July 2000, when "The Infamous Juan Joke"[2] was shared on encyclopedic website Everything2. The joke consists of a lengthy absurd story about the political career of a man named Juan. However, after he attempted to murder his pet aardvark, he was sentenced to death by firing squad. According to the Body Building Forums,[1] the face was taken from a panel in the third issue of the Defenders comic book published in 2005. In the original comic, the character Bruce Banner is shown making odd facial expressions as he attempts to transform himself into his alter ego The Hulk: The earliest known use of the image as a reaction face can be found on 4chan’s /tg/[2] (Traditional Games) board in a thread about the Zombie Quest comic series posted on September 23rd, 2010. In the thread, one of the repliers posted the "Ooh Face" to express that he disagrees with another poster's view.  Directed by M Night Shyamalan and starring Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment, The Sixth Sense was released on August 2nd, 1999. In the film, the child protagonist Cole Sear (played by Haley Joel Osment) can be heard uttering the line before Dr. Malcolm Crowe (played by Bruce Willis) to reveal that he can see ghosts. The quote was also prominently featured in a number of promotional clips and official teaser trailers. It was parodied in the 2000 horror spoof film Scary Movie[13] (shown below, right) after the character Shorty (played by Marlon Wayans) smokes too much marijuana. As early as 2001, the catchphrase evolved into a snowclone, with one of the earliest variations substituting "dead" with "dumb" and posted via a personal website[6] on January 4th, 2001.  The exact origin of the expression is unknown. According to a post on /r/OutOfTheLoop,[2] 4chan users began posting the phrase on the /pol/ (politically incorrect) board after Obama was elected in 2008, but no archived threads have been found. On April 8th, 2013, prominent British conservative politician and former prime minister Baroness Margaret Thatcher died of a stroke. Befitting her reputation as the "Iron Lady" who redefined British and modern European politics, the news of her death was met by mixed feelings from liberals and conservatives on Twitter. Meanwhile, it soon became apparent that many younger Twitter users had little knowledge who Margaret Thatcher was, especially after the British boy band One Direction's Harry Style tweeted a condolence message. RIP Baroness Thatcher .x The confusion quickly prompted the launch of the Tumblr satire blog Who is Margaret Thatcher[11], numerous articles concerning the public unawareness of the Thatcher's legacy[12], as well as the duplicit Twitter hashtag #nowthatchersdead.  Catbug made his debut on January 10, 2013 in the episode "Gas Powered Stick." Catbug is a half-cat, half-ladybug alien creature with a childlike curiosity and positive, enthusiastic outlook on life. He has also been featured in the episodes "Ultra Wankershim" and "Catbug." Catbug has the ability to travel through space-time to other dimensions, as explored in the season one finale "Catbug." Catbug has become a fan favorite character and viral hit on the Internet spinning off parodies and references to his standout lines from the series so far. The quote was originally said by Ygritte in Chapter 15 of A Storm of Swords (page 213, U.S. paperback edition). In the chapter, Ygritte says the line to Jon Snow in anger. This happens because Jon asks why she was crying because of a song about "the last of the giants" when he had just seen hundreds of them. There were tears on Ygritte's cheeks when the song ended. "Why are you weeping?" Jon asked. "It was only a song. There are hundreds of giants, I've just seen them." "Oh, hundreds," she said furiously. "You know nothing, Jon Snow… In HBO's Game of Thrones, Ygritte (played by Rose Leslie) delivers the line once in "A Man Without Honor" (Season 2, Episode 7) that aired in May 2012 and made several additional appearances throughout Season 3 in accordance with the novel series. Gwiyomi (귀요미, pronounced as Kiyomi) is a South Korean internet slang term[2] meaning "cute" or a "cute person" used in somewhat similar vein to the Japanese term "Kawaii." Composed and performed by two South Korean aspiring musicians Dandi and Hari, the song was originally uploaded in late January 2013 and officially released as a digital single on February 18th, 2013 (shown below, left). Within days, the title of the song had become the most searched term on the Korean search portal site Naver. The repertoire associated with the song known as "Gwiyomi Player" was invented by Korean pop star Ilhoon Jung and introduced in a segment of the MTV show "MTV Diary BTOB" (shown below, right).  The earliest known instance of an online grassroots fundraiser dates back to 1997 when American fans of the British rock group Marillion independently funded and organized an entire U.S. concert tour through an Internet-based campaign, raising over $60,000. A few years later in 2000, the first music-focused crowdfunding platform ArtistShare was launched. Early examples of crowdfunding campaigns also sprang up in Japan with the group Electric Eel Shock raising £10,000 from 100 fans in exchange for lifetime guestlist privilege, becoming one of the first unsigned acts to fund their recording albums and concert shows. On July 25th, 2010, Florida resident Meagan Renea McCullough was arrested for driving under the influence. Her mugshot (shown below, left) and arrest information were subsequently uploaded to the arrest record database Arrests.org.[3] On August 9th, 2012, the photograph was included in a compilation of mugshots featuring attractive women on the men's interest blog The Chive[4] (shown below, right). On August 13th, the pictures were posted on the Japanese news website Daily News Agency.[7] On August 16th, a "sexy mugshots" gallery was submitted to the /r/pics[6] subreddit, which contained the McCullough picture. On August 26th, the Japanese pop culture blog RocketNews[8] reported that the photographs had been posted on the popular imageboard 2chan. On April 3rd, 2013, Redditor vestra submitted McCullough's mugshot with the caption "Wanted / In 50 states" (shown below) to the /r/AdviceAnimals subreddit.[1] Within 48 hours, the post received over 8,800 up votes and 550 comments.

Bison (character progression video shown below, left).[2] Chun Li's best-recognized move is Hyakuretsukyaku,[3] commonly known as Lightning Kick, during which Chun-Li performs a flurry of high and low kicks (example video shown below, right).     The earliest known mention of Spoderman appeared on the website WrestleWarehouse.com,[7] advertisting a Spider-Man cape for kids. However, due to what the site is selling, it's can be assumed that this is a typo and not related to the meme. The earliest known appearance of Spoderman appeared on FunnyJunk[9] on March 29th, 2012. User evilfederation posted a picture of the character, a poorly drawn version of the Marvel comics superhero (shown below), received more than 770 upvotes and 64,000 views in five years.  The “Actresses Without Teeth” Tumblr[1] blog was launched on March 26th, 2013, with the first post featuring a photoshopped picture of actress Julia Roberts from the 2009 romantic spy film Duplicity without her upper teeth (shown below).[2] Within eight days, the post received over 400 notes.

On March 28th, 2013, video journalist Christine Lee took a photograph of American golfer Jason Dufner slouching against the wall during his visit to the Salesmanship Youth and Family Center (shown below). The same day, Twitter[4] user David Watkins tweeted the photograph which was subsequently picked up by the Gawker sports blog Deadspin.[1]  According to a related origin story, the 10% myth most likely arose from a misunderstanding of neurological research in the late 19th century or early 20th century. For example, the functions of many brain regions are complex enough that the effects of damage are subtle, leading early neurologists to wonder what these regions did.[2]The brain was also discovered to consist mostly of glial cells, which seemed to have very minor functions. Dr. James W. Kalat, author of the textbook Biological Psychology, points out that neuroscientists in the 1930s knew about the large number of "local" neurons in the brain. The misunderstanding of the function of local neurons may have led to the 10% myth.    Since pre-antiquity, tools have been made and improved on. It is impossible to tell when tools were first used, but all evidence points to tools being created before the advent of homo sapiens, since other animals use tools.[1] According to Vice,[3] the Circle Game was invented by Ohio resident Matt Nelson in the early 1980s. Nelson claims to have devised the game while in elementary school as a way to punch his friends. The game was popularized on November 15th, 2000 in the fourth episode of the television sitcom Malcom in the Middle's second season. In the episode, characters play the Circle Game, introducing to the show's millions of viewers. It was first mentioned by the alchemist Zosimos of Panopolis in the early 600's. South Park was first released in 1997, and though 2002 Kenny was killed off in various ways for the sake of a running gag. The first sights of this modern myth first date from 1995 in Puerto Rico, USA.[1] Eight sheep were found with their blood completely drained. Townsfolk suspected Satanists of the crime, yet this phenomena repeated itself across the island. After the name chupacabra was coined, more incidents were reported in the mainland US and throughout Central and South America.[1]  The origin of the first snowman is unclear, However, it should be noted that Bob Eckstein, author of The History of the Snowman documented examples of snowmen from as early as medieval times. The earliest documentation he found was a marginal illustration from a work titled Book of Hours[1] from 1380. The theory was first proposed by Hungarian writer Frigyes Karinthy in his short story Chains, which was first published with other short stories titled Everything is Different in 1929. While hidden references to various pieces of art could be found prior to its release, the 1979 Atari video game Adventure is widely reported to have the first Easter Egg. When the game was released, the game's creators were not allowed to credit themselves in the game, so _Adventure_'s creator Warren Robinett built a secret room in the game that contained the text "CREATED BY WARREN ROBINETT."[1] In August 1980, The page was discovered by a 15-year-old boy, who sent a letter[2] that detailed how to get into the room to Atari. After Robinett left the company, the page (shown below) was too difficult and expensive to remove, Atari decided to leave it and include them in more games. Steve Wright, the Director of Software Development in the Atari Consumer Division, at the time, said, "From now on, we're going to plant little 'Easter eggs' like that in the games. Eventually, we may have a real treasure hunt, with the clues hidden in various cartridges!"[3] The idea of Werewolves is thought to have originated in Ancient Greek Literature and Mythology. For example, Herodotus[1], in his Histories[2], wrote that the Neuri, a tribe located in the north-east of Scythia, were all transformed into wolves once every year for several days, before changing back to their human shape. Another example would be Pausanias'[3] story of Lycaon[4], who was transformed into a wolf because he had ritually murdered a child. It is hard to pin the exact origin, but it is shown that Alchemy dates all the way back to the Greco-Roman Egypt times. The earliest known instance of magic incarnations date back to the 4th or 5th centuries BC, where clay tablets had been excavated from houses in Mesopotamia containing magical incantations. While the basic idea that the composition of one’s internal fluids reflect the person’s outward demeanor dates back to the ancient Egyptians and Mesopotamians. the internal fluids weren't systematically categorized until approximately 400 BC when the ancient Greek physician Hippocrates[3] asserted that the amount of each of the four humors inside a person affected their moods and emotions. Hundreds of years later, circa mid-to-late 100s AD, physician Galen of Pergamon[6] directly correlated the humors to Empedocles’[4] theory of the four classical elements[5] earth, wind, fire and water in his dissertation De temperamentis.[9] If someone was in excess of one of the humors, they took on the strongest personality traits affiliated with them: Blood was associated with the "sanguine," sociable and epicurean, yellow bile was "choleric," ambitious and enthusiastic, black bile was "melancholic," introspective and observant, and phlegm was "phlegmatic," carefree and serene. The inventor of the rubber balloon, (the most common balloon) was Michael Faraday in 1824, with various gasses and liquids. The first commercially marketed water balloon was produced by Edgar Ellington in 1950, while trying to invent a waterproof sock to solve the disease known as trench foot.[1] While the origin to the phrase is unclear, one of the earliest references and uses of the phrase was on Christopher Columbus's ship log, where he wrote that he killed and ate a serpent, and described it: The people eat them and the meat is white and tastes like chicken. [3] The phrase had then entered the media stream sometime in the twentieth-century, where many films, television shows, and plays used the phrase in its current definition today. In the second century BC, the Kingdom of Judah was part of the Seleucid Empire. Because the Jews were not allowed to adhere to their religious customs by Seleucid law,[1] they rose against their masters in rebellion and successfully gained independence and freedom to worship. The Kingdom of Judah ordered the altar in the temple rebuilt, but there was only enough oil to light the altar for one day, and it would take 8 to make more oil. The one day of oil miraculously lasted eight days. Since then, the eight day miracle is celebrated as a Jewish holiday, in which it is customary to give gifts, light candles, eat food, and play games. [researching] The earliest known reported sighting of creature has been recorded as early as 1924, when Canadian lumberjack Albert Ostman[1] claimed he was allegedly abducted by a group of these creatures during his work. In the the silent comedy Mr. Flip, a man goes around town trying to flirt with various women, always winding up getting hurt in some way shape or form. The film climaxed with a waitress throwing a pie at the mans face. It is not known when the trend started, as nobody has ever recorded the first princess kidnapping, but it likely happened around the medieval era, where young men would strive to become knights and save fair maidens from terrifying beasts. The gag has been used since before the 1930's, has appeared in various plays on stage, and still finds itself used on occasion in modern animated and live-action television. Despite coming to play decades after its first usage, the 1960's television show Scooby-Doo used this in nearly every single episode.[3] It became so synonymous with the running gag that it became part of the trope's name. Because of the hand-drawn animation styling, it was easy to focus only on a single, easy-to-draw hallway and fill the characters in when needed. This allowed for time to be filled on a low-budget.[5] The term "Hype Train" was used as early as November 26th, 2002 on the gaming review site IGN[1] in a review of the Japanese version of Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire[2] which wasn't released in North America until March 2003. Author Craig Harris explained that they received advanced copies of the game to “get the hype train moving,” noting that he had trouble navigating through it as he did not speak Japanese. His review also suggests that Nintendo products "print money," which was later popularized in the 2004 Newgrounds flash animation Decline of Video Gaming 2.[3]  The first mention of Paul Bunyan in writing was in a Michigan newspaper in 1906. A book in 1925 also named Paul Bunyan elaborated on this myth of how supposedly Paul Bunyan was a massive Quebecois woodsman involved in the Papineau Rebellion against the British Queen.[1] However, some have challenged the myths, citing them as fakelore.[2] However, Paul Bunyan is firmly planted in the mythos of historical Quebec, being in many cartoons, shows, and stories, with statues of him and his ox scattered across many forested areas of North America.  Although Pascal's Triangle is named after French mathematician Blaise Pascal, the triangle was used in China as early as the 11th century, 600 years before the time of Pascal.[3] The triangle was first developed by mathematician Jia Xian as a tool to find both square and cubic roots.[2] In the 13th century, it was formally described in the books Xugu Zhaiqi Suanfa and Suanfa Tongbian Benmo by mathematician Yang Hui, giving it the name "Yang Hui's Triangle" in China (shown below).[2] Monarchy dates back to the ancient eras of civilization, in which leaders would cement their power through the people and then hold onto it. Some but not much is known about the old days of monarchy, however old monarchs such as Gilgamesh,[1] Sargon,[2] and the Xia Dynasty Emperors[2] would seize power through cunning and skill, give themselves regal ceremony, and hold onto power for life, often passing power down to their offspring or chosen heirs. Monarchy has evolved to intertwine religion into the kingship, using religion to further solidify their power. The Xia Dynasty was believed to have their mandate to rule by the gods, and so they could not be deposed because the gods allowed them to rule.[4] In Egypt, the Pharaohs were considered to be gods. In England, because God could not be bothered to rule England directly, he would rule through the British Crown, and the British Crown is charged by God to rule England.[5]  Although they are somewhat mythological, Rat Kings did exist in reality due to poor sanitation. The first recorded sighting was in 1564. (Hart, Martin (1982, c1973). Rats. Allison & Busby Ltd. p. 66.) However, they had a superstitious mythological quality: The people that saw them often saw them as being omens of impending disease, a curse on the towns in which they appeared. Although there was a correlation between Rat Kings and disease, it was because places with poor health and sanitation were ripe for the spread of diseases and the formation of Rat Kings, this was not because Rat Kings had a mystical quality to attract pestilence.  One of the earliest mentions of a fountain with healing water was mentioned in the third book[2] of Histories[1] by ancient Greek historian Herodotus[3] in the mid-400s BC. Though similar healing waters persisted in the mythical exploits revolving around Alexander the Great[4] and Khidr[5], the idea gained much traction through a mention in the 14th century novel The Travels of Sir John Mandeville.[6] The excerpt (shown below) refers to a chasm found at the foot of an unknown mountain outside of modern-day Kollam, India as "the well of youth."[7] There is no particular time for which the Changelings were first found in European folklore, however it is most persistent within the late middle ages, Renaissance, and industrial era. In Ireland, it was believed that to envy someone's baby made them more susceptible to being snatched. (W. B. Yeats, Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish Peasantry, in A Treasury of Irish Myth, Legend, and Folklore (1986), p. 47, New York : Gramercy Books) In England it was believed that fey and trolls were susceptible to certain kinds of herbs. (The Borderer's Table Book: Or, Gatherings of the Local History and Romance of the English and Scottish Border by Moses Aaron Richardson, Printed for the author, 1846. Page.133-134.) In Wales, cooking eggs would frighten changelings. In Scandinavia, changelings were thought to be weak to iron. There have been myths of horned rabbits for centuries, but the Jackalope of American fame was first mentioned in 1829 by John Colter, one of the first settlers of Wyoming.[1] Since then, the legend has spread, and many people in the following years went hunting for Jackalopes, with the legend becoming so big as to be featured in the New York Times. The earliest known appearance of the word "vampire" in English language can be found in a 1734 travelogue titled "Travels of Three English Gentleme" published in the Harleian Miscellany in 1745. While myths and folklores describing vampire-like monsters have been recorded by numerous ancient civilizations, including the Mesopotamians, Hebrews, Ancient Greeks and Romans, the quintessential archetype of charismatic and intelligent vampire was largely developed through the teachings of the Christian Church and early works of vampire literature, most notably John Polidori's 1819 novella The Vampyre and Bram Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula, during the 18th century in Europe, particularly in the Balkans and Eastern Europe. The line "may the force be with you" in its entirety was first said in Star Wars: Episode IV-A New Hope[1], which was released on May 25th, 1977. The phrase was used by General Dodonna[11] (Alex McCrindle) when wishing Luke (Mark Hamill) good luck as he prepares to fight the Empire. It was also famously used in a later scene, when Han Solo (Harrison Ford), who has been skeptical about the force, says the phrase to Luke (Mark Hamill) as a show of support before he goes into battle.    It is literally impossible to get an exact date on something like this, nobody wants to remember getting smacked the first time their wife or girlfriend uttered these words. It's been around for at least the last century. Music is a form of idea and emotional communication that has existed since antiquity.  The numbers that are used worldwide nowadays are basically Arabic numbers. They were actually developed by Arabic Muslim scientists who revised the Indian version of numbers that contains only nine numbers. That took place during the 8th century (771 A.D) when an Indian Gastronomist came to the Almansour royal palace with a book – famous at that time – about astronomy and mathematics called “Sod hanta” written by Brahma Jobta around 626 A.D. Almansour ordered to translate the book into Arabic and explore more sciences.[2] Sports have existed since antiquity. Nobody is certain what the oldest sport is, but leading theories point to wrestling. Since then many more sports have come and went, with many more creative forms since the advent of new forms of technology. There are many theories as to the origin of language, with most scholars, such as Charles Darwin, suggesting it couldn't just happen suddenly, but was absolutely necessary and evolved with the human species. These are referred to as continuity-based theories. Because the origins of language have to be located in human prehistory, exact dates and time frames are merely speculative, and can't, with today's technology, be reasonably determined. There are some hypotheses about the origin of Swastika. Some of the earliest cultures utilizing swastika were the neolithic Vinča culture[2] of South-East Europe and the Indus Valley Civilitzation.[3] The earliest swastika known has been found from Ukraine, carved on a figure made of ivory. The earliest known appearance of the symbol was found in Chinese cave temples dating back to the 6th and 7th centuries during the Sui dynasty (shown below).[1] A local legend[1] states that a pregnant woman named Mrs. Leeds had cursed her child when she went into labor, yelling "let this child be a devil." Though the baby boy looked normal after he was delivered, he slowly began to mutate in to a creature that resembled a horse with bat-like wings, shrieking before it flew through the roof of their cabin. The Kamehameha attack was first used in the Japanese manga series, Dragon Ball, by character Master Roshi who used it to destroy a fleet of attacking warships (anime counterpart shown below). Following this, main protagonist Goku learned the attack, and it soon became his signature move, using it multiple times throughout the series. On August 14th, 1945, photographer Alfred Eisenstaedt took a photo of a Mendosa and Friedman kissing in Times Square in celebration of the United States victory over Japan, which subsequently ended World War II. The Photo was published a week later in LIFE magazine in a section called "Victory Celebrations". This photo would later become the most famous images published in LIFE as well as one of the most famous images of WWII in general. Another photo of the same scene from a different angle was captured by photographer Victor Jorgensen, a U.S. Navy photo journalist. This image was published in the newspaper The New York Times the next day and was titled Kissing the War Goodbye Jorgensen's image falls under public domain, while Eisentaedt's is protected by copyright.[1] According to The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English,[1] the earliest known example dates back to the 1970s, in which the number sequence 5318008 is turned to spell the word "BOOBIES" (shown below). The Jelly Bracelets have been popular in waves, since 1980. During a ressurgence on 2003, became the subject of an urban legend, relating them with the sexual color-coded Handkerchief code, explaining their popularity among the teenagers. For this, they were dubbed "sex Bracelets".  The song was originally released as part of a self-titled album by band Caramba[1], with the album being the band's only release. The album became famous, due to the entire album being recorded using a made-up language. The first know usage of the word was in a 3rd century Roman book, titled "Liber Medicinalis", by then Royal Physician to Emperor Caracalla[2] , Quintus Serenus Sammonicus[3]. The book stated that malaria sufferers were to wear an amulet containing the word written in the form of a triangle. It stated that this would then rid the body of lethal diseases. The first known mention of the game was in the book Wuzazu (五杂组) by the Chinese Ming Dynasty writer Xie Zhaozhi (shown below), which was created around the year 1600. In the book, Xie Zhaozhi wrote that the game dated back to the time of the Chinese Han Dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD) and was called shoushiling (手势令; lit "hand command"). In Japanese history, the people often played sansukumi-ken, which followed a similar style as rock-paper-scissors. Over time they were imported in Japan, where they became popular in Japanese society. Neither Japan nor China made use of the standard objects which are currently used in the game, but instead made use of animals. A popular legend claims that the two-finger salute originated from a gesture often made by English and Welsh longbowmen during the Hundred Years' War as a sign of defiance and insult against the French who supposedly had a habit of cutting off the arrow-shooting fingers of captured soldiers. However, the authenticity of the story remains in dispute. The earliest known documented evidence of using the V sign as an insult dates to 1901 in an Edwardian-era film depicting workers outside Parkgate ironworks in Rotherham, according to the now defunct website Icons.org.uk. The origin of the phrase is unknown. However, it first appeared following the publication of the volume of the Lord of the Rings, The Return of the King, on October 20th, 1955. According to Cracked, [1] the phrase grew in usage during the 1960s and 70, following the paperback publication of the book series. They wrote: At the time, the phrase appeared on buttons, graffiti and bumper stickers (examples below).    Though reports of a monster in Loch Ness date back to the 6th century in a biography of the Irish monk Saint Columba[1], the creature did not gain worldwide attention until 1933 when George Spicer and his wife reported seeing a 40 to 50 foot long animal crossing the road near Loch Ness.[2] That year, the dozens of others reported seeing a monster in the area that year, including Hugh Gray who took the first photo of the animal that November (shown below). In 1934, the most famous photograph of the creature was taken by Robert Kenneth Wilson, a London-based doctor. The image came to be known as "The Surgeon's Photograph"[3] and was published in The Daily Mail on April 21st, 1934. Though The Sunday Telegraph revealed the image to be a hoax in 1975, people have continued to debate its authenticity. The stock photo of the thumbs-up signing businessman was originally hosted on the Microsoft Office[5] image database (shown below, left). On March 27th, 2012, Redditor Bournefox submitted an image macro based on the stock photo to the /r/AdviceAnimals[2] subreddit (shown below, right). Prior to being archived, the post received over 14,000 up votes and 210 comments.  Though online discussions about placing an ice cube over salt on bare skin date back to as early as 2005[5], the first video demonstration was uploaded to Break[6] on July 8th, 2006 (shown below). As of March 2013, this clip has been viewed nearly 600,000 times and has been shared more than 166,000 times. Launched in 1996[12], RhymeZone is a rhyming dictionary that retrieves a series of rhymes for an entered word or phrase. As early as November 2011[5], Tumblr users noted the absurd nature of some of the responses the site, such as the provision of “chronic obstructive pulmonary disease” as a rhyme result for “seas.” One of the first examples of RhymeZone being used in the context of lyrical parodies appeared sometime prior to February 2012, when the since-deactivated Tumblr user wooskie recreated a "Roses are Red" poem[2] using RhymeZone on the lines “sugar is sweet / and so are you.” As of March 2013, this post has gained nearly 60,000 notes.  In late 2011, a handful of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic fans began including a ponified version of its creator, Lauren Faust (shown below, left), into explicit Rule 34 fan works. These were mostly met with negative comments due to Faust's iconic status within the fandom, leading other bronies to edit sandwiches in to the fanart in an attempt to stop its creation (shown below, right). Due to the closing of the largest My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic image board Ponibooru in August 2012, many of the original instances of both the Rule 34 images and the edited versions have been lost. The earliest archived image was uploaded to the image board 20% Cooler on October 31st, 2011.[7] The song was recorded on 1993, but it appeared a year after in the album A mí me gusta. During 1995 and 1996 it was an international hit.   W.I.P. Parody re-enactments of harnessing and blasting Qi in the form of energy balls have been circulating on the South Korean web under the generic name "Qi attack play"[6][7][8] (장풍놀이) as early as since 2009. However, the photo fad didn't reach the English-speaking and western audiences until March 25th, 2013, when Japanese Twitter user ちゃんまん[9] (@mkpiiii9) posted an image of herself and her classmates staging a dramatic shot. Her remark "Makankosappo!!!!!!" (マカンコウサッポウ！！！！！) refers to the special beam cannon of Piccolo from the Japanese popular manga/anime series Dragon Ball, though its action is completely different from the original. マカンコウサッポウ！！！！！ twitter.com/mkpiiii9/statu… On October 9th, 2012, Twitter user @NostrandAv shared a photo of a woman taking a picture herself pretending to be asleep, with the caption "Females Be Like 'Bae Caught Me Slippin'"[2], a snowclone variation of the expression Bitches Be Like. As of March 26th, 2013, the tweet received 22 retweets and 14 favorites. FEMALES BE LIKE … twitter.com/Daweeq/status/… On February the 13th, 2013, Dean Boshoff uploaded a video to YouTube titled 'Worlds Cutest Frog – Desert Rain Frog', which shows the frog mainly showing its unusual squeaky noise. As of now, it's hit nearly 6 million views. The video can be seen here: He said about this: 'I recorded a short clip of the defensive cry of the Desert rain frog – Breviceps macrops while walking along the sand dunes in Port Nolloth, a coastal town in the Northern Cape province, it alerted me to its presence with its fearsome war cry. I knelt down and proceeded to photograph and film this unusual creature's behaviour' 12 days later (or February the 25th), Dean Boshoff uploaded a new video of the desert rain frog, titled 'Worlds cutest frog – all new footage!' Shown here: However, this has only had 161,000 views as of today. The phrase "KyoAni Finds A Way" originated on the /a/ board or the Anime & Manga section of 4chan as a parody image macro of Dr. Ian Malcolm's now famous Jurassic Park scene where he contends that "Life finds a way."[1] It is meant to be a way of expressing either amazement or sarcasm at the ability of anime studio Kyoto Animation (a.k.a. KyoAni for short) to always find new and inventive ways of showing off the moe genre and sometimes to rehash old versions in new ways whether successful or not[2]. On August 11th, 2010, YouTuber wendyvainity uploaded a video titled “Meow! Sad Toy Cats.wmv," starring a variety of computer animated cats rendered in the Daz Studio[5] animation software and accompanied by a text-to-speech voice repeating the phrase “meow meow I am a cat” (shown below). Within the next three years, the video received over 480,000 views and 3,700 comments. The tradition of assigning Vocaloids items began with the song "levan Polkka", AKA Leekspin. In the video, a chibi version of Hatsune Miku, "Hachune Miku", was depicted waving a spring onion. The tradition was set in stone once the male Vocaloid KAITO was rediscovered and associated with ice cream. This resulted in attempts to give other Vocaloids character items, resulting in the Item Wars. UTAUs such as Kasane Teto and Fanloids are also given character items despite the fact that most traditions of the Vocaloid fandom have been abandoned by UTAUs. Fanart depicting the Vocaloids with their respective items can be found sites such as deviantART and Pixiv.  On March 21st, 2013, YouTuber TrippingOverFunny uploaded a video titled “Kabooyow! Kapooyow!”, which featured a clip from an NBC 2 Houston local news report about a hail storm that had struck some parts of Texas and Colorado on the day before. In the clip, Clark was quoted as saying “it was like ’kapooyow! kapooyow!” in describing the sound of her house getting battered by the hail (shown below). Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo (trailer shown below) (trailer shown below) was released on December 21st, 1984 and was met with mediocre reviews from Variety[10] who called it a “comic book” and Roger Ebert[11] who gave it 3 stars. As of March 2013, the film has been given 4.3 stars out of 10 on IMDb[3] and 3.4 stars out of 5 on Rotten Tomatoes.[12] Online, the phrase became adopted as a denotation of any sequel release as early as October 2nd, 2001, in a blog post about a radio show by actor Wil Wheaton.[3] On March 7th, 2013, Thumbs and Ammo[2] was launched on the blogging platform Blogspot, with its first post[1] featuring Brad Pitt from the 1995 thriller film Seven edited to have his gun replaced with a hand making a thumbs-up signal (shown below). According to the tech news blog Mashable,[6] the blog started as a Photoshop competition between the site’s co-creators and was not intended to convey an anti-gun message. The label “gritty reboot” was originally used as early as July 2009 in a Cracked[1] articled describing a comic by Mike Jacobsen[2] depicting a Grimdark rendition of The Wizard of Oz in which the Tin Man and the Scarecrow are shown surgically removing Dorothy’s brain and heart.  Just Little Things launched on December 31st, 2010, posting 34 image macros utilizing plain black text on different colored backgrounds to describe a number of simple pleasures in life. The blog was the brainchild of Californian student Nancy Vu, who launched the blog during her sophomore year of high school. As of October 2012, Just Little Things had more than 500,000 followers and saw 25,000 page views per day.[2] As of March 2013, there are more than 880 image macros on the site. On February 26th, 2013, The official Oreo YouTube channel uploaded the first commercial of the series featuring a Rube Goldberg-style Oreo cookie separator machine purportedly built by physicist David Neevel. Within the next three weeks, the video received over 4.03 million views and 4,000 comments. The video was soon revealed to be part of the “Cookie vs. Creme”[4] marketing campaign by Wieden + Kennedy,[1] Portland-based advertising agency that is best known for producing several successful Old Spice advertisements. The word "Grimdark" is a shorthand for ”grim darkness," which initially became popular as the tagline of the tabletop dystopian sci-fi game Warhammer 40,000: “In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war.” Released in 1987, the phrase has been associated with the game online since as early as 2000, when it was mentioned on a page on hobby site Starship Modeler[4] in a review of the Flacon Grav Tank model that appears in the game. The single topic blog "shit no one has ever said"[1] was launched on Tumblr in May 2010 by a group of two writers, a producer, and a lawyer. The first post criticized the manner in which people discuss politics on Facebook, claiming that no one would ever go to the site to read “intelligent, objective opinions” on the Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act, an Arizona state legislative act requiring alien residents to carry their registration documents with them at all times, which sparked much controversy[9] in April 2010 after several groups disputed whether or not the law violates the civil rights of immigrants. On July 6th, 2010, Twitter user @donni[10] became one of the first people to use the term in a tweet, noting his distaste for striped vests. This tweet was favorited almost 650 times as of March 2013. "I see you're admiring my striped vest," said no one ever.  The children's animated television show The Magic School Bus[1] originally ran from September 1994 to December 1997. In the show, a third grade elementary school class embarks on various field trips led by their teacher Ms. Frizzle on her magical school bus, educating the viewers about science along the way. One of the recurring characters in the series is Carlos, the class clown best known for his constant pun jokes that lead his classmates to groan "Carlos!" in unison (shown below). On September 19th, 2007, a thread discussing an abortion was posted on 4chan featuring messages written from the perspective of characters from The Magic School Bus. In the thread, Carlos responds with an abortion pun, to which another poster replies with “Carlos!” (shown below). Not much is known about the origin except it is mostly common on picture websites and 4chan's /b/ board.       On December 4th, 2008, the original video was uploaded to the adult media website eFukt.[1] As of March 2013, the site claims to have received over 6 million visits to the video page.  The colloquial expression “non mais allô quoi,” which roughly translates to “Hello? Like, are you serious? Wake up!” in English, is most commonly used by French women to express incredulity towards someone else's discreditable behavior. The original quote can be heard in Season 5, Episode 3 of the French reality television show Les Anges de la téléréalité (Angels of Reality), which follows the lives of 12 contestants living together in a Miami mansion, that aired on March 5th, 2013. In one of the interview segments in this episode, contestant Nabilla Benattia can be heard uttering “Allô ! Non mais allô quoi !” to express her shock after discovering that one of her housemates did not carry her own shampoo. Several videos of her reaction were subsequently uploaded to YouTube as early as March 7th, with one version accumulating over 1.1 million views by the following week English Translation:  (researching) The term catfish originated from the 2010 documentary film[5] of the same name. Directed by Ariel Schulman[1] and Henry Joost[2], Catfish follows the story of Schulman's brother, Yaniv "Nev" Schulman[3], as he develops an online relationship with Megan Pierce, a girl he meets through her younger sister Abby. As the documentary progresses, it is revealed that Megan Pierce is a fake identity based on a woman in rehabilitation and assumed by Megan's mother, Angela. The documentary was partially met by skepticism regarding the authenticity of the film, believing that the circumstances are too well put together to have taken place in real life. However, no one involved in the production has confirmed the notion. The song was released on January 22nd, 2003 as a single for R. Kelly’s fifth studio album Chocolate Factory.

The lyric was taken from an incident in member Jayson Musson's life where he got into a fight and finished by getting up and doing the dance. Bauuer's song was met with positive reception from electronica & trap music blogs, as well as other artists including Diplo, Brodinski, and Flosstradamus. On January 30th, 2013, video blogger Filthy Frank uploaded an episode that opens with four people dressed in latex suits dancing to Baauer's "Harlem Shake" (shown below, right).  While it remains unclear exactly when or where Internet users began creating and exchanging e-cards in celebration of Valentine's Day, this online custom most likely began through exchanges of casual holiday greetings via e-mail, before gradually evolving into more visually interesting forms like rejected candy hearts and personalized greeting e-cards with the advents of image captioning tools and custom message generators in the early to mid-2000s.    Prior to Beyonce's performance, the founder of SuperPAC Elect a New Congress William Fawell called for a boycott of the halftime show.[1] He asserted that Beyonce's and Jay-Z's music celebrated the "modern criminal police state" and that the performance would be un-American. The morning following the performance, Fawell declared in an email to U.S. News' Washington Whispers blog[2] that the diamond-shaped hand gesture Beyonce made at the end of her performance was proof that she was a part of the Illuminati, a group named after an 18th century secret society that is allegedly part of a conspiracy to create a totalitarian government for the entire globe known as the New World Order.[3] On December 13th, 2012, the first picture of Sam (shown below) was uploaded to the Instagram feed @samhaseyebrows,[1] which received over 430 likes and 40 comments within the next two months.

During an interview with New Republic[2] on January 27th, 2013, President Obama was asked if he had ever fired a gun, to which he answered that he goes skeet shooting at Camp David frequently. Four days later, the Washington Post's Fact Checker[13] began investigating these claims and noted that it could not find any proof of Obama having participated in skeet shooting. In response to this criticism, the White House released an official photograph of the President skeet shooting at Camp David via their official Flickr[1] account on February 2nd, 2013, along with a caption[4] requesting that the photograph not be manipulated in any way.

The earliest known definition of the word “flaming” as used in the context of Internet discussions can be found in the 1983 edition of The Hacker’s Dictionary[9] by Guy L. Steele: "To speak rabidly or incessantly on an uninteresting topic or with a patently ridiculous attitude."      On May 1st, 2012, Reddit user ohgoshwheretobegin posted a thread in subreddit AskReddit (a Reddit sub-forum where users ask for and receive answers from other users on specific questions) titled, "Throwaway time! What's your secret that could literally ruin your life if it came out?"[1] The thread became popular, and was filled with many dark and disturbing stories in response to the original question, so much it became #3 top thread on Reddit of all time. Among the many responses was a story from redditor Lynfect, who told the story of him stealing some of his cousin's possessions.[2] Upon further inquiry buy reddit user eeeeevil[3], Lynfect disclosed further information of the previously mentioned cum box.[4] Along with the account, Lynfect also uploaded an Imgur album containing images of the cum box for proof.[5] Much disgust and horror was expressed by many other redditors in response to the account and album. Upon frequent request by redditors, Lynfect decided to post an additional update image of the now oft-mentioned cum box[6], of which had started to develop mold.  These types of accounts may have been inspired by deviantART's Plz Accounts, which utilize the site's avatar system to recreate conversations between fictional characters. As early as 2009, people began to create YouTube accounts for fictional characters using the prefix "Imma" to denote them as being novelty accounts. One of the first of these, ImmaVegeta[1], was created on March 10th, 2009 and has gained more than 23,000 subscribers. In addition to commenting in character, ImmaVegeta has uploaded nearly 1,500 videos including recut footage from Dragon Ball Z episodes as vlogs from the character during which they interact with other YouTubers or comment on YouTube happenings as well as unedited clips from the anime.

The first time Bart Simpson was shown writing on a chalkboard in The Simpsons occurred in Season 1, Episode 2 titled "Bart the Genius"[1], which originally aired on January 14th, 1990. During the episode's opening sequence, Simpson is shown writing "I will not waste chalk" repeatedly on a school chalkboard (shown below). The earliest known customization app titled "Bart Simpson Chalkboard Sign Generator" was posted on the image macro site Txt2Pic[6] in August of 2007, which allowed users to create custom images specifying the text shown on Simpson's chalkboard (shown below).  The term "circle jerk" was initially used to describe a sexual practice in which a group of men masturbate themselves or each other while sitting in a circle. The earliest known use of the term dates back to 1979, when the Los Angeles punk band the Bedwetters renamed their band to the Circle Jerks after one of the band members found it in a dictionary of English slang words. While there are digital footprints of its usage on Usenet newsgroups[15] in the 1980s and 1990s, "circle jerk' largely remained an offline slang term.[16] Then on January 22nd, 1999, Online Slang Dictionary[4] user Audrey M. submitted an entry for "circle jerk," alternatively defining the term as "a pointless group endeavor." On February 12th, 2001, the book Studs, Tools, and the Family Jewels: Metaphors Men Live By[2] by Peter Francis Murphy was released, defining "circlejerk" as "a boring or time-wasting meeting or other event." On May 17th, 2003, Urban Dictionary[7] user "anti-racist" submitted an entry for the term "circlejerk," which defined the term as both a group sex act and an echo chamber-style discussion. "To kneel in a circle with others and pleasure oneself. Also refers to a pompous, self-congratulatory discussion where little to no progress is made."

On October 28th, 2004, a video was uploaded to Metacafe[1] of a green Sky Cutter lawnmower flying in the air and performing aerial stunts accompanied by the song “Cotton-Eyed Joe” by the 1990s’ Swedish techno group Rednex (shown below). A copy of the original 1-800 CONTACTS commercial was uploaded by YouTuber TheWaffle816 on June 6th, 2012.

The picture that later became associated with Ken-Sama was first posted on Marisa Eber’s blog Nerd Knits[2] on September 7th, 2005. The person depicted in the photo (shown above) was later identified as Ebers’ husband, Bradon.  On September 10th, 2010, the Internet humor site College Humor[1] published a post titled "Realistic Gym Workout Diagrams," which featured parody workout posters for exercising specific muscle groups. In the article one parody poster in particular shows a man holding curling up in a fetal position with the phrase "Lie Down; Try Not to Cry; Cry a Lot" posted above (shown below). The image was later credited to CollegeHumor's Caldwell Tanner.[5] The original image template of a plain glass bottle was submitted by Pixiv user Akabane (緋羽)[1] on April 2nd, 2009[2] with the following description: "Please enjoy drawing with this! It's OK to change colors and size. Let's bottle everything!" The original comic titled "Outlook Oust" was posted on the webcomic site Hejibits[1] on December 24th, 2012, which depicted a Nintendo boardroom meeting about features included on the Wii U console (shown below).

On December 27th, 2012, Tumblr user Rohan Salmond, known by his handle robofillet, posted four photographs[1] of himself posing seductively with knitting needles and balls of yarn. Three days later, Tumblr user gokuma[2] suggested that he looked like a DC comic book villain. Later that day, the user fernacular[3] suggested that he should be nicknamed “The Knitter” and shared the first fan art drawing of Salmond’s original photos. This post has accumulated nearly 89,000 notes as of January 15th, 2013. The template image of this fad was an illustration of Bianca, which posted to Japanese artist community pixiv by Wakaba (わかば)[1] on June 23rd, 2012.[2] The first publicly available DDoS tools Trinoo and Tribe Flood Network were released in 1997 and 1998 respectively.[8] The first well-documented DDoS attack took place in August 1999, which targeted a single University of Minnesota computer and knocked the system offline for more than two days. DDoS came grabbed public's attention months later in February 2000, after a number of high profile search portals and e-commerce sites were taken offline for hours, including Yahoo!, Amazon, Buy.com, CNN, eBay, E*Trade and ZDNet. In addition, several companies reported significant losses due to the downtime, with Yahoo! losing about $500,000 and costing Amazon nearly $600,000.[7]  The original cartoon made its first online appearance on September 9th, 2003 in an English-language blog post titled "Typical Project Life,"[1] which metaphorically explains various perception gaps that often arise in software development projects through the simple task of building a tree swing.

Prior to its web launch, the students went around campus asking their peers why they needed feminism, taking pictures of them holding up a whiteboard with their explanation on it.[4] These photos were also printed poster-sized and hung around campus.  The term “Manic Pixie Dream Girl” was coined by film critic Nathan Rabin in a review of the 2005 comedy-drama film Elizabethtown published on The Onion's A.V. Club[1] on January 25th, 2007. In the article, Rubin uses the term to describe the character Claire (played by Kirsten Dunst): "Dunst embodies a character type I like to call The Manic Pixie Dream Girl (see Natalie Portman in Garden State for another prime example). The Manic Pixie Dream Girl exists solely in the fevered imaginations of sensitive writer-directors to teach broodingly soulful young men to embrace life and its infinite mysteries and adventures.” Guitar Hero was first released in 2005, but the first known FC videos were uploaded in 2006.[2] Many who uploaded these videos were using the guitar controller's Whammy Bar to achieve more in-game "Star Power", a score multiplier mode, in order to score more points. [6] With the release of Guitar Hero II and III and so on (for PS2, Xbox and PS3), more difficult songs, such as "Through the Fire and Flames" by speed metal band Dragonforce, have been added to the game's song list, and users typically add videos of these songs, which are near the end of the game, due to their high levels of difficulty. In addition, videos have been posted of the game Rock Band, which is very similar to Guitar Hero but may include other instruments from the game, because Rock Band features drums, bass, and vocals in addition to guitar. Users continued to use the controller's Whammy bar and the "Overdrive" feature, Rock Band's equivalent of "Star Power," to achieve the most points.[7] The entertainment news blog TMZ[1] published several photographs of Justin Bieber allegedly smoking marijuana at a party in a Newport Beach hotel room (shown below) on January 4th, 2013. Within four days, the post received over 15,000 Facebook shares and 12,000 tweets. On January 7th, 2013, a thread was posted to the /b/ (random) board on 4chan,[2] which urged other users to create Twitter accounts and post images of scarred arms to spread a rumor that Bieber's fans have begun harming themselves in response to the allegations of Bieber smoking marijuana (shown below). It is unclear where Gamble's quote originated from. According to the Touching All Bases[1] sports blog, Gamble once responded to a question about the prevalence of racism in Major League Baseball by saying “People don’t think it be like it is, but it do.” According to sports blogger Doug Lemoine,[4] Gamble uttered the famous phrase while discussing the chaotic New York Yankees management in 1975. A grainy black-and-white photograph of Gamble captioned with "They don't think it be like it is, but it do" (shown below) was posted on the Brownpau Tumblr[11] blog on May 4th, 2010. The photo of the balloon sculpture was first posted to Konami’s Facebook fan page on January 3rd, 2013.[3] According to the image description the sculpture was created by Florida-based balloon artist Bruce Carr[5] for his friend's birthday.

On September 12th, 2011, a group of four undergraduates at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, Canada started a Facebook account titled Queens U Compliments[1] (sic) with the idea that other Queen's University students could send a message to the profile's inbox sharing positive praise of someone else on campus. One of the four creators, Rachel Albi, Erica Gagne, Jessica Jonker or Amanda Smurthwaite, would then publish the comment from the account. As of January 2013, the account has 5000 friends and 208 additional subscribers. Winnie the Pooh's Home Run Derby (Japanese: くまのプーさんのホームランダービー) was originally released as a flash-based mini game on Disney's Japanese website in 2008.[12] An official version licensed by Disney was added to Yahoo! Kids on July 28th, 2008.[13] An English-translated version of the game can be found on the free gaming website FlashRelax.[1]     One of the earliest mentions of mic spamming appeared on April 30th, 2006 in a thread on the computer hardware enthusiast message board the [H]ard Forums.[4] Though the original poster (OP) of the thread initially requested help from others on how to play music over the mic in Valve’s first-person shooter game Counter-Strike, other posters began discussing their distaste for players who engage in such practice, with some even seeking out how to mute these “mic spammers.”  According to an article on the BBC,[1] the phrase "fiscal cliff" was first used in a New York Times article from 1957, in which writer Walter Stern used the term in reference to the financial consequences of people buying their first home. On February 29th, 2012, Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke popularized the term when speaking to the House Committee on Financial Services when warning about the effects of spending cuts caused by the Budget Control Act of 2011[8] and automatic tax increases from expiration of the Bush Tax Cuts in 2013. "Under current law, on January 1st, 2013, there is going to be a massive fiscal cliff of large spending cuts and tax increases. I hope that Congress will look at that and figure out ways to achieve the same long run fiscal improvement without having it all happen at -- at one date." On October 4th, 2012, British artist and taxidermist Adele Morse placed a stuffed fox for sale on the online auction site eBay. On October 14th, the fox was sold to a resident of Manchester, England for 330 pounds. According to an interview with Morse in Wales Online,[10] she began receiving messages from Russians within a couple of days telling her they loved the fox and wished to have one.  On January 31st, 2008, a thread was posted to 4chan’s /b/ (random) board with a clip art image of a carton of chocolate milk and the original poster proclaiming his love for the drink. In the thread, an anonymous poster was reportedly banned for confessing his/her preference for regular milk, as seen in the screenshot (shown below):   The earliest known use of “cancer” in this context appeared in early 2007 as part of the catchphrase "The Cancer That is Killing /b/" in a thread on the GunzFactor forums[3] detailing the history of 4chan’s Habbo Hotel raid. Another user in the thread called out the OP for doing so, lamenting that "fags" from other websites have been flooding 4chan’s /b/ (random) board and degrading the quality of conversations on the forum. On November 11, 2010, YouTuber Andrew Huang[1] uploaded the video "PINK FLUFFY UNICORNS DANCING ON RAINBOWS" to his channel as a response to a comment on his previous video: The video has since gained over 3 million views.  The audiotrack with no name was written by Japanese compopser Shunsuke Kikuchi. It had been often played in scenes of ordinary situations in Doraemon TV anime series from 1970s to mid 2000s. And, those situations included braggings by Suneo Honekawa (骨川スネ夫), one of the main characters in this series who is always proud of richness of his family.[2] This song was also included as a part of a medley track in a compilation CD album for his audio works in the anime series which was released in 2001.[3] However, this song itself had never stood out in people's memory because it wasn't particularly impressive for all watchers. According to niconico Pedia[4], this song was first uploaded to NND on August 28th, 2008. Then, during it reprinting again and again between NND and YouTube, its video title became to change into "The song played when Suneo is bragging". And, this song came to light when this video was reprinted again with this title from YouTube to NND on August 29th, 2009.[5] The original comic was posted on September 22, 2011, by animator Bertrand Todesco[1] on his blog: Nearly a year later, three of the panels were posted on Tumblr by Miss Bonnie Bunny[2]: The term “Fanboy” first appeared as the title of a 1973 fanzine attributed to Alfred Judson and Bill Beasley, who distributed an initial run of eleven prints at that year’s Chicago Comic and Nostalgia Convention.[1] Though it was initially believed to have been authored by Judson and Beasley to critique the obsessive nature of fans[2], comic artist Jay Lynch[3] later revealed in a July 2008 post[5] on his now defunct blog that the zine was created by himself and publisher Glenn Bray.[4] Lynch explained that the term came from the slang term "funboy," which was used in the 1960s by Bill Killeen as an insult for critics of his Tallahassee-based publication The Charlatan, known for its provocative content.[6] "Fanboy" was intended to satirize the way traditional comic fans disregarded underground comics considered as "vulgar modernism," as exhibited in the untraditional art styles found in humor magazine Mad and Zap Comix. [7] The earliest known instance of the meme was titled “25 Essential Expressions Challenge" and submitted to DeviantART[2] by user napalmnacey[1] on May 17th, 2007 . The image featured a blank template containing boxes for 25 different facial expressions (shown below) and captions for corresponding emotions.  The film Office Space was released on February 19th, 1999, in which the protagonist Peter Gibbons (played by Ron Livingston) is repeatedly exploited by his boss Bill Lumbergh (played by Gary Cole), a stereotype of a corporate manager who focuses on pointless paperwork and asks employees to work over the weekend. On September 7th, 2011, Redditor Mekrob submitted a "read this in my voice" image macro to the /r/pics[1] subreddit, which featured a screen capture of Lumbergh with the caption "Yeeeaah, if you could just, go ahead and read this in my voice, that'd be great" (shown below). Prior to being archived, the post received over 480 up votes and 25 comments. On February 22nd, 2012, Redditor toastercookie submitted a post titled “Captain Kitteh” to the /r/aww[1] subreddit, featuring a picture of a cat dressed in a captain’s uniform (shown below, left). Prior to being archived, the post received over 8,100 up votes and 210 comments. The same day, Redditor khdutton submitted an image macro using toastercookie's photo to /r/AdviceAnimals[2] with the caption parodying an airline captain's flight safety announcement before takeoff (shown below, right). The post received over 10,900 up votes and 95 comments prior to being archived. In 2002, the very first video he posted on the internet is A Charlie Brown Kwanzaa, a video parody of A Charlie Brown Christmas. It was originally created as a video experiment he passed around and bootlegged on VHS. In 2005 his video is discovered on the web by millions of fans. A redux version of A Charlie Brown Kwanzaa is made in 2003, one year later after the first video.  According to Google[2] cached search results, a Meme Generator page for "OCD Otter" was created as early as May 13th, 2010. The earliest instance shown on the site features the caption "Teacher erases whiteboard / asks to get up and erase the pieces she missed." The original photo of the southern sea otter was taken by photographer Ron Wolf of Tom Stack & Associates Inc.[12]    On December 4th, 2012, the Tumblr user ChuckQuizmo[1] posted a photo of himself holding up a piece of lined paper with the Japanese word "レタス" (lettuce) printed on it. The photo was accompanied by the text ""Never Give Up"," as to imply the Japanese term on the paper was that phrase. As of December 24th, the post has accumulated nearly 33,000 notes. This gem of maymaytic culture originated on the vast lands of forumotion.com in one of its many individual forums, specifically speaking thehastudents.  Despite the Twilight Novel series launching in 2005, the term wasn't used until the release of Twilight's Film Adaptation, where the sparkling visual effect could be seen first hand. (Exact Origin is still unknown.) Presumably, information of his death in terrorist attack to Domodedovo first appeared in “Metro” newspaper on 25th of January. His fans asked about it on question-answer sites, like answers.mail.ru for many times. Despite its soon rebuttal, this information has spread around the Internet. The catchphrase comes from a scene in the 2004 cult comedy film Napoleon Dynamite in which Kip is questioned by his uncle Rico about his girlfriend, to which he answers that "things are getting pretty serious" because they chat frequently on the Internet. On November 29th, 2012, a Quickmeme[2] page titled "Things are getting pretty serious" was created, with the first submission featuring a screen capture from the Napoleon Dynamite scene accompanied by the caption "She accepted my friend request on Facebook / So I guess you could say things are getting pretty serious" (shown below).[5] In 2010, Capcom and Ninja Theory revealed DmC: Devil May Cry. This game was essentially a reboot of the beloved action series Devil May Cry. However, the trailer was not well received by fans of the series, who thought that the new design of Dante was an insult to the fanbase. Not only because of its punk look, but also because of the drastical change in his personality. Another criticized aspect was the ambientation and overall look of the game. Notably, in this trailer Dante smokes, but in the final game he doesn't. YouTuber MrNuclearCat uploaded a video titled “Golden Eagle Snatches Kid” on December 18th, 2012, which showed a large eagle swooping down on a small child and attempting to carry him away before dropping him several feet to the ground (shown below). Within 48 hours, the video accumulated over 18 million views and 21,000 comments. The phrase first appeared in the Season 2 finale "The Monopolar Expedition,"[10] which originally aired on May 11th, 2009.[4] During the episode, Cooper says the phrase a total of three times (shown below), each time as a follow up to a joke meant to impress his cleverness upon his victims. As chemistry jokes play a large role in the series, the term comes from combining the chemical symbols for Barium (Ba); the fictional element from the Timber Wolf[5] comics Zuunium (Z), Iodine (I), Nitrogen (N) and Gallium (Ga). This lead to fans believing that Bazinga is Sheldon's variation of "Zing", a term coined in the early 20th century[11] used to emphasize a situation when someone has been hit with a striking remark known as a "zinger." One of the earliest instances of the phrase “Ola K Ase” in image macros appeared on the automobile enthusiast forum ForoCoches[2] on November 1st, 2012. The first post contained a set of three photos featuring a llama and two different dogs with variations of the phrase overlaid on them.  "The D" first made an appearance on the 2004 single "So Sexy" by American rapper Twista featuring R&B artist R. Kelly. The song was the second single released from Twista's fourth album, Kamikaze, and became Twista's third straight top 40 hit from the album, having peaked at 25 on the Billboard Hot 100. Interlude Lyrics (R. Kelly):   According to the creator of the pasta JC-the-Hyena, the story was originally inspired by an edited screen capture of the title screen for the original Sega Genesis video game (shown below).[2] On August 9th, 2011, JC-The-Hyena submitted a creepypasta story based on the image to the Creepypasta Wiki,[3] which describes a haunted Sonic the Hedgehog video game containing disturbing content. I'm a total Sonic the Hedgehog fan much like everyone else, I like the newer games, but I don't mind playing the classics. I don't think I've ever played glitchy or hacked games before, though I don't think I want to play any after the experience I had… It started on a nice summer afternoon, I was playing Sonic Unleashed (I liked how you get to explore the towns in it) until I noticed, out of my peripheral vision, that the mailman had arrived and put something in my mailbox as usual and left. I paused my game to go see what I got in the mail… The only thing in the Mailbox was a CD case for computers and a note. I took it inside. I looked at the note first and realized it was from my dear friend Kyle (Let's just call him that), whom I hadn't heard from in 2 weeks. I know that because I recognized his handwriting, though what was weird is how it looked; it looked badly written and scratchy and somewhat difficult to read, as if Kyle was having a hard time writing it down and did it in a hurry. This is what he wrote… "Tom, I can't take it anymore, I had to get rid of this thing somehow before it was too late, and I was hoping you'd do it for me. I can't do it, he’s after me, and if you don't destroy this CD, he'll come after you too, he's too fast for me…. Please Tom, destroy this god-forsaken disc before he comes after you too, it's too late for me. Destroy the disc, and you'll destroy him, but do it quick otherwise he'll catch you. Don't even play the game, it's what he wants, just destroy it. Please… Kyle" Well, that was certainly weird. Even though Kyle IS my best friend and I haven't seen him in 2 weeks, I didn't do what he asked me. I didn't think that a simple gaming disc would do anything bad to him, after all it's just a game right? Boy, was I wrong about that… ANY way, I looked at the disc and it looks like any ordinary computer CD-R disc, except it had black marker on it written "SONIC.EXE", and it was much unlike Kyle's handwriting, meaning that he must've gotten it from someone else, like a pawn shop or eBay. When I saw "SONIC" on the writing of the CD, I was actually excited and wanted to play it, since I'm a a BIG Sonic fan. I went up to my room and turned on my computer and put the disc in and installed the game. When the title screen popped up I noticed that it was the first Sonic game, I was like "Awesome!" Because like I said earlier I liked the classics. The first thing I noticed that was out of place was when I pressed start, there's was a split second when I saw the title image turned into something much different, something that I now consider horrifying, before cutting to black. I remember what the image looked like in that split second before the game cut to black; The sky had darkened, the title emblem was rusted and ruined, the SEGA 1991 was now instead SEGA 666, and the water had turned red, like blood, except it looked hyper-realistic. But the freakiest thing that was in that split second frame was Sonic, his eyes were pitch black and bleeding with two glowing red dots staring RIGHT AT ME, and his smile had stretched wider up to the edge of his face. I was rather disturbed about that image when I saw it, though I figured that it was just a glitch and forgot about it. After it cut to black it stayed like that for about 10 seconds or so. And then another weird thing happened, the save file select from Sonic the Hedgehog 3 popped up, and I was like "WTF? What's this doing in the first Sonic game?", anyway, then I notice something off, the background was the dark cloudy sky of the Bad Stardust Speedway level from Sonic CD, and there were only three save files. The music was that creepy Caverns of Winter music from Earthbound, only it was extended and seemed to have been in reverse. And the image for the save file where you see a preview of the level you're on is just red static for all three files. What freaked me out more was the character select, it showed only Tails, Knuckles and to my surprise, Dr. Robotnik! Now I was sure that something was up, I mean, how can you play as Robotnik in a classic Sonic game, for crying out loud? That's when I realized that this wasn't a glitchy game, it was a hacked game. Yeah it definitely looked hacked, it was really creepy, but as a smart gamer, I wasn't scared (or at least I tried not to be), I told myself that it was just a hacked game and there's nothing wrong with that. Anyways, shaking off the creeped out feeling I picked File 1 and chose Tails and when I selected and got started. The game froze for about 5 seconds and I heard a creepy pixelated laugh that sounded an awful lot like that Kefka guy from Final Fantasy before cutting to black. The screen stayed black for about 10 seconds or more, then it showed the typical level title thing, except the simplistic shapes were different shades of red and the text showed only "HILL, ACT 1". The screen faded in and the level title vanished revealing Tails in the Green Hill Zone from Sonic 1, the music was different though, it sounded like a peaceful melody in reverse. Anyway I started playing and had Tails start running like you would in any of the classic Sonic games, what was odd was that as Tails was running along the level there was nothing but flat ground and a few trees for 5 minutes, that was when the peaceful music started to lower down into slow deep tones very slowly as I kept going. I suddenly saw something and I stopped to see what it was; it was one of the small animals lying dead on the ground bleeding (That was when the music started to slow down), Tails had a shocked and saddened look on his face that I never saw him have before, so I had him move along, and he kept that worried look on his face. As he kept moving I saw more dead animals as Tails moved past them looking more and more worried as the music lowers and he moves past more dead animals, I was shocked to see how they all died, they looked like somebody killed them in rather gruesome ways; a squirrel was hanged on a tree with what appeared to be his entrails hanging out, a bunny had all four of his limbs torn off and a duck had his eyes gouged out and his throat slit. I felt sick to my stomach when I saw this massacre and apparently so did Tails. After a few more seconds there were no more animals and the music seemed to have stopped, I still kept Tails to continue. After a minute passed after the music stopped, Tails was running up a hill and then he stopped, it wasn't until I saw why; Sonic was there on the other side of the screen with his back against Tails with his eyes closed. Tails looked happy to see Sonic but then his smile faltered, obviously noticing that Sonic wasn't responding to him, if not acting as if he was totally oblivious of Tails' presence. Tails walked slowly toward Sonic, and I noticed that I wasn't even moving my keyboard to make him move, so this had to have been a cut scene. Suddenly I began to have a growing feel of dread as Tails walked closer to Sonic to get his attention, I felt that Tails was in danger and something bad was going to happen. I heard faint static growing louder as Tails was but inches away from Sonic and stopped and stuck his hand out to touch him. That foreboding feeling in my gut was growing stronger and I felt the urge to tell Tails to get away from Sonic as the static grew louder. Suddenly in a split second I saw Sonic's eyes open and they were black with those red glowing dots, just like that title image, thought there wasn't a smile. When that happened the screen turned black and the static sound was off. It stayed black for about 7 seconds and then white text appeared forming a message, saying, "Hello. Do you want to play with me?" At this point I was creeped out, I didn't want to continue with the game, but my curiosity got the better of me when I was taken to a different level with the level title now saying "HIDE AND SEEK". This time I was in the Angel Island level from Sonic 3 and it looked like everything was on fire. Tails looked as though he was scared out of his wits this time. He actually looked at me and made frantic gestures to me as if he wanted to get out of the area he was in as fast as possible. I was starting to get freaked out by this…I mean Tails was actually breaking the fourth wall, trying to tell me to get him out of there. So I pressed down on the arrow key as hard as I could and made him run as fast as he could, a pixelated version of that creepy theme when you meet Shadow at the ARK as Robotnik from SA2 was playing as I made Tails trek through the desolate forest, trying to help him escape from whatever he was trying to run from. Suddenly I heard that creepy laugh again… that awful, Kefka laugh… right after 10 seconds have passed as I helped Tails run through the forest, and then I started seeing flashes of Sonic popping everywhere on the screen, again with those black and red eyes. The music changed to that suspenseful drowning jingle as I see Sonic behind Tails slowly gaining up on him FLYING; Sonic wasn't running, he was actually FLYING! The flying pose his sprite was making looked very similar to Metal Sonic's flying pose in Sonic CD, except it was just Sonic and he had the black and red eyes again, only THIS time he had the most deranged looking grin on his face, he looked as though he was enjoying the torment he was giving the poor little fox as he gained up on him. Suddenly when Tails tripped (another cut scene) the music stopped and Sonic vanished. Tails laid there and started crying for 15 seconds. The scene was rather upsetting to watch and I kind of teared up myself. But then Sonic appeared right in front of Tails and Tails looked up in horror. Blood started to come down those blackened eyes of Sonic's as a grin slowly grew from his face as he looked down at the horrified fox, I could do nothing but watch. Just in a split second Sonic lunged at Tails right before the screen went black, there was a loud screeching noise that only lasted 5 seconds. The text returned only this time it said "You're too slow, want to try again?" and then that god-awful laugh came with it. I was so shocked by what had happened…did Sonic murder Tails? No, he couldn't have… He and Tails are supposed to be best friends, right? Why did Sonic do that to him? I shook the shock off as I was brought back to the character select, the save file that had Tails was different; Tails was no longer in the box itself but in the TV screen itself, which was flickering with that red static, Tails' expression scared me, his eyes were black and bleeding, his orange fur had gone black and he had an expression of anguish on his face, Trying to ignore it I picked Knuckles next. The laugh came again and the screen cut to black again and stayed there for another 10 seconds, this time the level said "YOU CAN'T RUN". I was really freaked out by now, I couldn't really tell if this was a glitch, or a hack, or some kind of sick twisted joke… or anything really. But despite my fear of what happened next, I kept playing. The next level looked much different, it had the ground of the Scrap Brain zone, but the sky background looked like the main menu; it had the dark reddish cloudy sky. But it was the music that creeped me out the most: It sounded like Giygas' theme right after you beat Pokey in Earthbound. I also noticed that Knuckles looked afraid just like Tails did, though not as much, more rather he looked a little unnerved. He broke the fourth wall just like Tails and looked as if he wasn't sure about going on, but I made him move anyway. He ran down the straight pathway in this dark level, and as he did the screen started to flicker red static a couple times and then that maddening laugh came again. Then after a few seconds of running I notice several bloodstains on the metallic ground, I felt a growing sense of fear again thinking something horrible is going to happen to Knuckles. He looked nauseated walking down this blood-stained road, but I still kept him going. Suddenly as Knuckles ran, Sonic appeared right in front of him with those black and red eyes and then red static appeared again, when the static vanished showing nothing but black screen with text saying "FOuNd YOu!", I was now scared, Sonic found Knuckles already?! What was going on?! Anyway red static came again and then I was back to the level, Knuckles looked like he was panicking, and Sonic was nowhere to be found. And this time that high-pitched squealing from the Silent Hill 1's final boss was playing. Was this some kind of boss battle with Sonic? I hoped to God it wasn't, honestly. Suddenly Sonic appeared right behind Knuckles in what appeared to be pixelated black smoke, I made Knuckles turn and then punch Sonic, but Sonic vanished in black pixelated smoke before I could even land a hit, that terrible laugh went off again. Then Sonic appeared behind Knuckles again and then I made him punch again, and Sonic vanished again laughing. Knuckles was panicking even more, and even I felt like I was going crazy, Sonic was practically playing with us, he was playing a sick twisted little mind game with me and Knuckles… Another cut scene played as Knuckled fell to his knees and clutched his head sobbing, I felt his agony, Sonic was actually driving us BOTH crazy. And then in a split second Sonic lunged at Knuckles and the screen went black with another distorted screeching noise that lasted for at least 3 seconds. Another text message appeared, "So many souls to play with, so little time… would you agree?" What the hell… Just what is going on? I started to think Sonic was actually trying to talk to me through the game… But I was too scared to think that. I was brought back to the main menu and this time the second file box had Knuckles in the TV screen, his red fur had darkened to a reddish grey, his dreadlocks were dripping with blood and his eyes were black and bleeding too, and he had a look of sadness on his face. I began to think that those are the actual characters trapped in those TV screens on the save files, but I couldn't believe it… I didn't want to believe it… So I shut off the game and took a break. I took a nap, wish I hadn't, 'cause I then began to have the most disturbing nightmare, I was in pitch black darkness, though I was under the light given off by a lamp that hung high above my head. I could hear the cries of Knuckles and Tails nearby. They were saying stuff like, "Help us…" and "Why did you give us to him?" and "Run away, before he gets you too…" Their cries died out as I then heard Sonic laugh, his laugh… it sounded a lot like the distorted Kefka laugh. "You're a lot fun to play with kid, just like your friend Kyle, though he didn't last long…" I was scared and looking around for the source of the voice… "Won't be long now until you join him and all my other friends…" I saw him walking toward me, flickering in and out in several directions… "You can't run, kid. You're in my world now. Just like the others…" When he grabbed me and I saw his bleeding black and red-eyed, grinning face, I woke up with a fright. After a couple of hours I decided to continue playing the game. I don’t know why, but I had to know, I had to figure out why this was happening… So I turned on the computer, turned on the game and selected Robotnik next. I still thought that was wacky, playing as Robotnik, but anyway the level title appeared again and this time it said "…", which I found really freaky. This time I was in some kind of hallway, didn't really look like it was from any of the classic Sonic games, though it has the pixelated style; the floor was shiny and checkered, the walls were a dark greyish purple with animated candlelight’s and a few dark bloodstains here and there, and there was a dark red curtain hanging above on the top part of the screen. Every 12 seconds or so that red curtain sways very slowly, but whenever you're playing the game you can barely see it move. The music was oddly pleasant, a piano playing a rather sad yet peaceful song, but I knew better, this was the song that played in Hill act 1, only it wasn't in reverse. Robotnik didn't look entirely nervous like Tails and Knuckles did, but he did have a suspicious look on his face as if he was just a bit paranoid. He did a little animation when I just left him standing, he turns his head to the left and then to the right at least twice and then shrugs at me, as if he has no idea where he was or what was going on. Even though I was scared outta my mind about what was going to happen, I had Robotnik continue onward. He did his usual running animation (You know, when you've beaten him at the end of a classic Sonic game and you chase him) as we continued going through the hallway. Then I stop at a long flight of stairs leading downward, now I was nervous, even Robotnik seemed unsure of himself, though I pressed onward. As I led Robotnik down the stairs, I noticed that the walls have gotten darker and more reddish; the red torches are now an eerie blue. Then we landed onto another hallway, this one was longer than the last one (or at least it felt like it) and then we headed down another flight of stairs down, this one was much longer, took at least 1 full minute. And then I heard that horrid Kefka laugh again and then the music slowly faded until it was quiet, as it did the walls turned more dark red and the torches were a black flame now. When Robotnik landed onto the 3rd hallway, I noticed he now looked really creeped out, though he tried to hide it, I couldn't blame him, I was scared too. Suddenly, Sonic popped right in front of Robotnik the same way he did Knuckles and then red static. The red static lasted for about 15 second and then it showed me a most unpleasant image… The image showed a hyper-realistic of Sonic standing in the darkness where you can only see his face while his head and torso faded into black, and when I say hyper-realistic, I mean like he looked so real you could actually see the lines in his blue fur, as if you could actually feel the fur if you touched the screen. His face…oh god, he had the most horrifying smile I had ever seen. And that's saying something considering I saw that image at the start of the game. His eyes are wide and black and once again crying blood (Which also looked hyper-realistic) and there were two small glowing red dots in those black eyes staring RIGHT AT ME, as if staring into my mind. His grin was wide and demonic, it literally stretched to the sides of his face like a Cheshire Cat except Sonic had fangs, VERY SHARP fangs, much like the Werehog's teeth except more vicious-looking, somewhat yellowish and from the look of it, he had stains of blood and small bits of flesh on his lips and fangs as if he ate some animal. I stared at that gruesome image for a good 30 seconds, never taking my eyes off it, I felt as if he was actually looking at me, smiling at me…that face, it just took 10 seconds for it to etch itself into my brain for good. Then the screen flickered with red static again 3 times, and on the 3rd time I heard the Kefka laugh, except this time it sounded distorted, demonic even… It went back to the image again except this time there was the text again though it was messed up, but it was pretty much one of the most horrifying things I looked at since I had this game… "I AM GOD." It was when I read that message while looking at Sonic when it hit me, I realized right there and then. This Sonic was a monster, a pure evil, sadistic, all-powerful, nightmarish, demented monster… and all of his victims, including Tails, Knuckles, Robotnik and possibly Kyle, are just his little toys, and the game is the very gateway into his chaotic, nightmarish world and the very Hell his victims are trapped in. Suddenly in an actual split second I screamed as Sonic lunged at the screen screeching loudly with his mouth wide open to an unnatural length revealing nothing but a literally spiraling abyss of pure darkness before the red static came again, this time much louder and distorted, so loud that it hurt my ears, I yelled and grabbed my ears as the red static screeched for a good 7 seconds. Then it stopped and showed nothing but black screen. As I sat there staring at the black screen, one last text came up. "Ready for Round 2, Tom?" The Kefka laugh, now sounding more clear as if Sonic was right behind me, played again 3 times as I looked at that text in shock and confusion. Then I got booted back to the main menu and this time the third save file had a TV image of Robotnik in the same, tormented state as Tails and Knuckles; Robotnik's skin turned a dull grey, his mustache drooped and had blackened, his glasses broke and blood is coming from them and he had a mere dead like expression on his face. I looked at Tails, Knuckles and Robotnik and I cried a bit, I pitied them for the agony they're going through, they were forever trapped within the game, forever tormented by that horrid hedgehog, and always will be. Then the computer shut itself off, I couldn't turn it back on no matter what I did. I sat there for maybe 25 seconds, horrified by what had just happened… Sonic is the very embodiment of evil, he tortures people who play his game in more ways than one and then when he gets bored he drags you into the game, literally drags you to Hell, where he can play with you always, as his toy…. I can't get the game outta my computer. I think it's stuck in there, but at least I managed to turn it back on now. After I sat there for 25 seconds I heard a voice right behind me, like a whisper… "Try to keep this interesting for me, Tom." I turned around to see where the voice came from, and what I saw made me scream… Sitting on my bed… staring right at me… … Was a Sonic plushie, smiling with bloodstains under its eyes. Hina Kagiyama first appreared in the 10th main series Touhou game Mountain of Faith. She is both the midboss and the main boss for the second stage of the game.[1] Before the player fighters her as the main boss, the player has a conversation with her. During this conversation, one of her possible facial expressions is one expressing a villainous intent (seen below). Due to the limited artistic capabilities of the game's creator, ZUN, however, the face is often seen by fans as something sillier instead.  The little girl in the picture is Mía Talerico and she appears in the Disney Channel TV show called "Good Luck With Charlie". The image was taken from the episode titled "Meet the Parents" in a scene where Charlie is drawing with her mom they hear Chalie's dad screaming for help, Charlie's mom runs to see what happened and that's when Charlie makes the gesture.  [researching]  On August 4th, 2011, Redditor Scratchie submitted a post titled “Aristocat’s worked for it” to the /r/AdviceAnimals[2] subreddit, which included a black-and-white photograph of a well-attired cat with the caption “Poverty / Is a lazy man’s problem” (shown below, left). According to the vintage media website Vanished Americana,[1] the original photograph came from a 1906 postcard with the caption “One of the ‘Smart Set’” (shown below, right). Dopefish was one of 24 potential characters that id Software's Tom Hall designed for the fourth Commander Keen episode: "Goodbye, Galaxy!". The drawings were approved and the character got implemented into the final game. The species is described by the in game help text as the "The second-dumbest creature in the universe, this creature's thought patterns go "swim swim hungry, swim swim hungry." They'll eat anything alive and moving near them, though they prefer heroes..". The Dopefish is a large green fish with small fins, big eyes and enormous buck teeth. He appears in the underwater level "The Well of Wishes", where one of his signature moves is belching, while facing the viewer directly.    The city design blog City of Sound[1] published a post titled "Duck-sized horses" on October 9th, 2003, which featured a photograph from a newspaper asking "who would be victorious in a fight between 100 duck-sized horses and one horse-sized duck" (shown below).   From the episode 'Once Bitten, Twice Ed', the character Ed is being commanded (unknown by a character called Eddy) to obey the 'Great Baron O'Beef Dip' by eating his mattress.  According to the show's creator, Seth MacFarlane, the phrase was inspired by a friend, as well as stand-up comedian, Steve Marmel, who would apparently call Seth and perform Jerry Lewis impressions over the phone, which eventually devolved into the giggity phrase seen throughout the show.  Dashboard cameras became common in police vehicles in 1990 after two officers from Houston, Texas bought a standard video camera with their own money in 1988. The camera was a way to provide more evidence in court to help prosecute drunk drivers, as their impaired driving and demeanor would be captured. Between November 1989 and April 1990, all 17 videotaped arrests lead to guilty pleas in Franklin County, New York.[1] As early as 2002[2], local news websites began hosting dashboard-filmed videos of accidents or car chases released from the police. Redditor xJDRAGx submitted a post titled "Unfortunate" to the /r/funny[1] subreddit on December 4th, 2012, which featured a school photograph of a teenage boy with only part of his shirt visible displaying the words "I Came" (shown below). Within 48 hours, the post received over 20,200 views and 240 comments. The same day, Redditor mtldrummr112 submitted a post titled "Premature Peter" to the /r/AdviceAnimals[6] subreddit, which featured an image macro of the school photo with the caption "She licked my earlobe aaand…" Within 48 hours, the post received over 13,500 up votes and 250 comments.  Vlog Home from Stockholm was first uploaded to the Youtube channel hartmanncara, a woman already famous for her eHarmony Video Bio, which went viral and caused her to become a famous user on Youtube. Snoopy was born on May 11th, 2011. Due to his pedigree, went on to become a show cat and his owner launched a Weibo[1] account to share pictures of the cat in between shows. However, since Weibo is limited to registered users, his owner also launched a blog[14] and an Instagram[2] account for the cat (shown below) by February 2012 as a way to share photos of Snoopy with a larger audience.   The earliest known use of an image depicting the emergency burn treatment as a metaphor for "you got burned" can be found in a FunnyJunk[3] post submitted on May 12th, 2012 in response to a class disciplinary report describing a hostile exchange between two students. The reaction image was posted by oodlesandoodles[4] was paired with the text "Hope they remembered to pour some cool water on that burn" and received 76 upvotes from FunnyJunk members. Though this specific image is the one most often used, other depictions including drawings can also be found.    The videos were uploaded to YouTube sometime prior to October 31st, 2012, when a GIF animated excerpt of an episode showing Reed preparing chili and cheese nacho dip was posted to Tumblr.[4] Though the original linked version has since been taken down, a duplicate version reuploaded on November 28th, 2012 earned more than 280,000 views in less than a week. One of the first uses of "your tears are delicious" online dates back to July 2007 in a thread on the Marriland forums[2] discussing whether or not it was unfair that Japanese Pokemon players were given access to more legendary Pokemon characters than American players. Soon, forum member Disfunction responded with “Cry more. Your tears are delicious,” telling the original poster that life is not fair.   On December 1st, 2012, webcomic artist Noelle Stevenson suggested on her Tumblr[1] that when superhero comic artists are drawing female characters in a stereotypical pose, the women should be replaced with Hawkeye in the same position. Shortly afterwards, fellow artist known as Blue or her handle hoursago[2], redrew the cover of the October 2011 issue of Marvel Adventures Super Heroes featured Hawkeye and Black Widow[7] where the positions of two titular characters were switched. The redrawn version now depicted Hawkeye hanging upside down with his legs spread and back curved. The post gained more than 16,000 notes within four days.  This TV anime series was aired from Octover 2012 to December 2012. The song used in the opening movie is "Sparkling Daydream" produced by Japanese female singer and songwriter ZAQ.[1] One of the highlights in this movie by Kyoto Animation is its unique rendition which frequently switches left and right frames along with that high-speed song. And the other is Rikka's adorable finger spin which appears from 0:58 in this video below.   Redditor Releasethedreadknot submitted the first instance of Actual Advice Mallard to the /r/AdviceAnimals[1] subreddit on June 19th, 2011, which featured an Associated Press[2] photograph of a mallard duck with the caption "Push in the sides of your tin foil package / it will keep the roll from falling out" (shown below). This post largely went unnoticed, receiving only 16 up votes and 0 comments prior to being archived. The term "white knight" is derived from the knight-errant stock character, a medieval figure in romance literature that would perform various acts to prove his chivalry. According to Wikipedia,[1] the term "knight-errant" was first recorded in the 14th-century poem Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, but was developed as a romance genre character during the late 12th century. The first Urban Dictionary[4] definition was submitted by user Jake on November 3rd, 2004, which defined the phrase as a male who attempts to aid a woman in distress.    Written by John Mescall and performed by Ollie McGill from the Australian ska and jazz band The Cat Empire, the "Dumb Ways to Die" music video was uploaded via YouTube on November 14th, 2012 and similar campaign illustrations appeared on newspapers, local radio and outdoor advertising throughout the Metro Trains network. The video features cartoon characters killing themselves in a variety of careless and absurd ways (shown below). Within two weeks, the video accumulated over 28.7 million views and 35,000 comments. It is available for purchase on the iTunes[9] store, where it holds a five star rating as of November 29th, 2012.     On November 27th, 2012, a J-15 fighter jet successfully landed on China’s first aircraft carrier Liaoning, marking a milestone for both the military and the country. During the take-off phase of the exercise, two flight deck officers known as shooters were seen giving a hand signal adopted from the U.S. Navy to let the pilot know he was clear for take off.[2]     In an interview with Cosmopolitan,[3] the fad's creator Tom Morris explained that he came up with the idea while sitting in a kitchen with a group of friends, who decided to film themselves milking outside of a Starbucks coffee house. After the video was well received on Facebook, the group decided to make a new video. On November 21st, 2012, the MilkingNewcastle YouTube channel uploaded a video titled "Milking Newcastle," in which several young men are shown dumping entire containers of milk over their heads in a variety of odd locations (shown below). Over the next six days, the video accumulated over 244,000 views and 800 comments.  The man who gave the name "Colombia" to this pose was a 19-year-old college student, one of the 4 contestants in a Japanese TV quiz show Panel Quiz Attack 25[1] aired on October 1st, 2006. He performed it at moment of deciding the winning of the game at this question: "What is the South American country of sharing boundaries over land with Panama in Central America?" Yes, the answer is "Colombia". Homestuck, a webcomic which follows a variety of characters as they play a sandbox-style game that affects real life, was initially supposed to progress through polls where the fans decided what actions the characters would take (shown below) in the comic. One of the first of these polls was posted on October 21st, 2009[29] and the top voted results were reflected in a page[30] of the comic published on the following day. The comic artist Andrew Hussie was eventually forced to move away from this method as the scale of fandom and their feedback continued to grow, causing many of the old suggestion threads on the MSPA Forum[19] to be removed or permanently archived.[31] Parodies of Hussie’s comics have been shared on the forums as early as 2007, with the earliest known instance titled “Bird Wizard”[33] being inspired by Hussie's comic Jailbreak[34], the oldest comic on MS Paint Adventures. At the time, Jailbreak was a forum-based comic as well. These fan adventures spurred the creation of a Forum Adventures[16] subsection in 2009. The section has accrued more than 2,000 threads as of December 2012. Some of the earliest discussion of the possibilities of Homestuck alternate universes came in the form of a dream thread[32] posted in December 2009, where many posters shared dreams that they have had about Homestuck or its characters. As Homestuck is based on a multiverse plot featuring characters that can cross timelines and interact with the main storyline, fan creations can be easily meshed into the main story using this canon logic. The suspected original artist "volcanomoon" (also known as Rage the Dragoon among other aliases) made Bump Girl/Chan as a means to bribe 4chan users into providing a source for another animated gif. From there, he used Bump Chan (as he refers to her) to continue his search while serving as an impetus to continue doodling. [1] Afterwards, the artist went on to create other "waves" in addition to two comics, one of which is currently in progress. [2]   On November 23 2012, Redditor mmmmmmmmichaelscott posted 'My grandparents figuring out their new iPhone…' to Reddit, accumulating 13,457 up votes and 11,433 down votes.    Derek Benson, a video game developer, launched the blog Lunch Bag Art[1] on September 7th, 2008, posting eight different lunch bags he had drawn on, featuring charaters from Pokemon (shown below, left), Canadian animated series Total Drama (shown below center) and Spongebob Squarepants (shown below, right). The earliest known instance of the original image was uploaded by Redditor Acielaw[9] to the /r/funny subreddit on December 9th, 2011, although it didn't gain notoriety on the site until the image was reposted[10] two days later. The repost accumulated 1,106 up votes and 789 down votes in total prior to being archived. The phrase is believed to have originated from an episode of the American television sitcom Arrested Development, which ran on the Fox television station from November 2nd, 2003 to February 10th, 2006. In the show, the character Gob would often utter the expression “I’ve made a huge mistake” after realizing he had done something wrong (shown below). Urban Dictionary[2] user dogmatica submitted an entry for the phrase on October 1st, 2005, citing Gob's use of the expression in Arrested Development (shown below).   One of the earliest appearances of the emoticon was posted to the Finnish image board Ylilauta[21] at 8:45 a.m. EST on November 18th, 2012. Posted on the site's International board, "( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)" was used as a comment in a thread about whether or not administrators should change the settings on their spam detector. After someone complained about seeing too many posts in stickied threads, an anonymous user used the emoticon and the phrase "this thread is leaking from the heavens." Other users began derailing the thread by posting derivatives of the emoticon with different types of eyes, which continued for three days.  This remark is taken from Madoka Magica's 10th episode "I Won't Rely On Anyone Anymore" which was first aired in Japan before dawn of March 11th, 2011, the day of Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. It appears in a scene of Homura's recollection to the second timeline that she had experienced. In that timeline, Mami who noticed the fate of magical girls by Sayaka mutating to a witch loses her head and kills Kyōko by shooting her soul gem. Then, she pointed her rifle in Homura's face and utters this remark with a very impressive despairing look. Transcript In the Metal Gear Solid[3] series, originally released on September 3rd, 1998, an alarm sound (shown below) plays when the player is detected by an enemy, which is accompanied by the appearance of a red exclamation mark placed directly over the enemy’s head. The player must then hide for several seconds before the enemy stops patrolling the area in order to avoid combat.  The photo for the cover was taken on an iPhone in a bathroom at the Chateau Marmont hotel in Los Angeles, California. Zach Hill explained that the photo was of sorts an embrace of homosexuality despite neither of the members being homosexual themselves.[1] The album was released on October 1st, 2012.  One of the earliest slideshows using this approach was posted to Tumblr on October 28th, 2012, by jacknoir-sexual[9], who used the format to explain the webcomic Homestuck from the perspective of his sister, who had never read it. The costume made its first appearance at the video game convention Tokyo Game Show 2011[2] as a promotional mascot for SEGA's Vocaloid video game for Nintendo3DS Hatsune Miku and Future Stars: Project Mirai.[3] While the promoters sought to emulate the exaggerated appearance of Nendoroid-style vocaloid characters featured in the game, the life-size mascot character was largely perceived as an inaccurate portrayal of Hatsune Miku.  The precise use of bumping threads appeared circa mid-1990s with the birth of web-based forums and then the first systems of threads classified by dates that could change and back up to a new position if new posts were added. While there are no archived threads available from the early days of BBS and forums, a glimpse at the first Internet netiquette[1] guidelines published in October 1995 suggests that the concept of "bumping a thread" had not become widespread on Usenet groups or mailing lists prior to 1995. One of the earliest instances and references to "bumping" can be found in a StraightDope forum thread titled "Bumping Threads"[2] posted in 2000. Because of how the post is written, as well as the answers, it remains clear that the "bump" slang seemed to already be rather known and used among internet communities.   Though the abbreviation's origins is sketchy at best, the earliest known uses of the phrase dates back to 1998, when it was used as a title for a drum and bass vinyl record, recorded by the Dutch electronic group Critical Adjustment[13].     The photo of Joan Clendenin and Jeremy Blosser was taken in August 2012 during the Republican National Convention. According to Clendenin, Ron Paul supporters standing near her assigned seat began shouting "point of order" after being upset by a ruling on that day's state roll call. For fifteen minutes, she was unable to hear or see any of the speeches.[1] Nearing the end of Paul's supporter's objections, she posed for the photograph as Jeremy Blosser stood in front of a microphone that was turned off.[2]     Though the parody accounts @nateDRUNKsilver[4] and @DrunkNateSilverp[3] were registered in June and October respectively, the trend did not take off until November 7th, 2012, when campaign consultant Dan Levitan tweeted about Nate Silver getting drunk and predicting people’s deaths in the New York City subway. By November 9th, the tweet had 3,086 retweets and 1,043 favorites. Drunk Nate Silver is riding the subway, telling strangers the day they will die A stock photo featuring several students talking in the background with a lone student wearing a melancholy expression in the foreground (shown below, left) was uploaded to the stock photography website Big Stock Photo[2] on September 30th, 2011. Redditor jtkamp19 submitted a post titled "Soul Searching Sophomore" to the /r/AdviceAnimals[1] subreddit on June 11th, 2012, which featured the same stock photo accompanied by the caption "Would introduce myself / If I knew who I was" (shown below, right). Within the next five months, the post received over 12,500 up votes and 360 comments. This song "SigSig" was first included in Beatmania IIDX 12 HAPPY SKY released on the Japanes arcade in July 13th 2005. It was composed and arranged by a Japanese DJ/video game composer Kousuke Saito, better known by his alias "kors k"[1], and its background animation was produced by a Japanese illustrator Maya Takamura, also known by her alias MAYA. They have another well-known collaborating work "smooooch ・∀・", which became to a popular subject for hand-drawn animated videos on NND in 2008. This song is also included to other music video games in BEMANI series: Pop’n Music, jubeat, REFLEC BEAT and DanceDanceRevolution X3 series. The first photograph taken in this manner was posted by a female Japanese Twitter user Kyouya (恭也) on October 30th, 2012[1] (shown below, left). After being inspired by a text-only tweet suggesting the idea, she gathered the items to replicate the costume of the character she considered to be her Husbando, Shintaro Midorima from the Japanese manga Kuroko's Basketball[2] (shown below, right). Midorima's trademark basketball jersey and glasses were placed in a laundry basket in front of a bathroom door, thus implying that the character is in the middle of taking a shower or a bath. The tweet earned more than 3700 retweets and 1300 favorites within a week. The singer-songwriter Bjork released a music video directed by Spike Jonze for her song "Triumph of the Heart"[2] in January of 2005, in which she leaves her anthropomorphic cat husband for a night out in the city. In the video, the cat is is seen seated at a table drinking coffee and reading a newspaper while dressed in a blue shirt (shown at 3:56 below). On February 2nd, 2012, Redditor DrTango submitted a post titled “I’ll just leave this here" to the /r/funny[1] subreddit, featuring a screen capture of the cat with the caption “I should buy a boat” (shown below). Prior to being archived, the post received over 12,350 up votes and 165 comments. According to a thread on the Gamespot Forums,[3] the term "camping" most likely originated with the 1990s multiplayer FPS games Doom (1993) and Quake (1996). The earliest submitted Urban Dictionary[2] definition for "camper" was submitted by user Patrick O'Neill on October 28th, 2002. Within 11 years, the entry received over 380 up votes. Found in online multiplayer games. A camper stays in one spot and waits for enemies to walk past him before attacking. The original photograph that started this meme was taken when Turushan was raising the cup he won from a Starcraft 2 tournament.    According to an article published by New York Magazine[1], the expression was first used in relation to the Holocaust during World War 2: “Never forget” long ago entered the lexicon, in relation to the Holocaust. It has now been reassigned to 9/11, where it is likely to remain. It has become a mantra and a marketing tool for politicians and merchandise alike. According to Wikipedia,[2] a similar slogan "Never forget the class struggle" was introduced by 1st Chairman of the Communist Party of China Mao Zedong in 1962, which subsequently became a popular slogan for the Chinese Cultural Revolution throughout the 1960s. The American rapper Ice Cube released the song "It Was a Good Day"[1] on February 23rd, 1993, as a single for his album The Predator. The following month, a music video for the song directed by F. Gary Gray was released, which featured Ice Cube depicting various events from the song's lyrics (shown below). On October 8th, 2009, the "Good Day Ice Cube" Meme Generator[2] page was created, which featured image macros based on a screen capture taken from the music video (shown below). The original Zelda response image was uploaded to the Japanese art sharing site pixiv[1] on January 31st, 2012. The image (shown below, left) features six incarnations of Princess Zelda from various Legend of Zelda games giving their reactions to being told "I love you" (shown below, right in English). The image was submitted as one out of more than 150 responses[2] to a blank template with text, which was created by pixiv user leopard[3] in January 2010.  On October 30th, Brazilian news site Ego[1] published a series of photos of Brazilian model Nana Gouvêa[2] posing with fallen trees caused by the destruction of Hurricane Sandy in New York City (shown below). The photos were supplemented by an interview with the model who said she enjoyed the storm, since it allowed her to spend several romantic days with her husband, music producer Carlos Keyes. Many people in Brazil found the images to be distasteful, saying Gouvêa appeared to be using the disaster as a backdrop for her own beauty.[6] The day after the photos were uploaded, the single topic blog "Nana Gouvêa em Desastres"[3] ("Nana Gouvêa in Disasters" in English) launched on Tumblr. Within 24 hours, the blog posted 45 images of the model photoshopped into various tragedies, including the sinking of the Titanic, the Hindenburg disaster and the September 11th attacks.   The man's identity remains unknown, but the earliest seen pictures of Torg were seen posted on the internet comedy/news site FARK as early as 2007.       The New Yorker[4] published a cartoon by artist Peter Steiner on July 5th, 1993, which featured an illustration of a dog seated at a computer telling his canine companion that “on the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog” (shown below). Years later on December 14th, 2000, The New York Times[5] published an interview with Steiner in an article titled “Cartoon Captures Spirit of the Internet,” noting that the cartoon did not receive much attention initially, but steadily grew in popularity over many years. It all started with the video of the "looping" glitch on the information centre as following: The popularity of the glitch increased as they all made YouTube Poops and/or Remixes The phrase originated in Season 9, Episode 2 “Buster the Myth Maker” from the children’s animated television show Arthur, originally aired on April 7th, 2005.[1] In the episode, the character Arthur informs his friend Buster that he may have been reading fabricated information on the Internet, to which Buster responds with the quote in shock and disbelief (shown below). "You really think someone would do that? Just go on the Internet and tell lies?" On July 21st, 2011, Tumblr[8] user meowie posted a screen capture of Buster from the Arthur scene with the caption "You really think someone would do that, just go on the Internet and tell lies?" The post recieved more than 29,000 notes in less than 10 years (shown below)   Henri is the online nickname of Henry, an eight-year-old rescued shelter cat in Seattle, Washington. His human “uncle” filmmaker William Braden created the first short (shown below) for a class project at the Seattle Film Institute. It was shot, edited and narrated in eleven days. Braden chose to use a film noir style with French narration to express Henri’s contempt for humans as well as other cats, especially a nameless white cat who appears in the videos. The name Le Chat Noir[1] (The Black Cat) is taken from the 19th century Parisian cabaret with the same name, which is best known for its iconic poster of a black cat against a red and yellow background by Théophile-Alexandre Steinlen. After the project was complete, Braden uploaded the film to YouTube on May 24th, 2007 and it has gained more than 1.6 million likes as of October 2012. In November of 2011, a Quickmeme[2] page was created titled "First World Metal Problems," featuring a photograph of Jimmy Cecco, the bassist of the metal band Animarium[4] (shown below, left).

During the third and the last U.S. presidential debate on October 23rd, 2012, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney criticized President Barack Obama's plan to reduce the size of the naval forces by asserting that there are fewer military ships than there were at the beginning of the World War I in 1917. Mitt Romney: "Our Navy is smaller now than at any time since 1917. The Navy said they needed 313 ships to carry out their mission. We're now at under 285. … We're headed down to the low 200s if we go through a sequestration. That's unacceptable to me." President Obama rebutted Romney's criticism by arguing that the quantity of naval firepower came second to their strategic roles and capabilities in the context of a technologically advanced and modern military. Barack Obama: "You mention the Navy, for example, and the fact that we have fewer ships than we did in 1916. Well Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets. We have these things called aircraft carriers and planes land on them. We have ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines. It's not a game of Battleship where we're counting ships, it's 'What are our priorities?'"    The song "Tamagotoji" was written by a Japanese female singer songwriter Kurahasi, Yoeko (倉橋ヨエコ)[1], which was first included in her 4th full Album "Tadaima" (ただいま, lit. I'm home) released in December 2005. asamoya ni kajikamu tsumasaki saka wo kogu jitensha konna toki koso ienai kimochi wo tamagotoji obentou ni komemashite yukou yukou yukou nee yukou yukou mata ashita konna toki ni wa ienai kimochi wo tamagotoji obentou ni komemashite yukou yukou yukou nee yukou yukou issho ni ienai kimochi wo tamagotoji obentou ni tsumemashite yukou yukou yukou nee yukou yukou rainen mo Via: YouTube -【卵とじ】 Pandora Hearts | Tamagotoji – Eng Subs.[2] Meanwhile, the first instance in this series was a video posted by a NND user ヨエコスキー (Yoekosukī)[3] on July 1st, 2009.[4] And that was a fanfiction for Touhou Project getting an inspiration from the song. In that video, he drew a story that Remilia Scarlet, who wasn't good at cooking, challenged making a good bento filled with her love/friendship for Reimu Hakurei with the help of many Touhou characters by his hand drawn animations. Final Fantasy VII was first released in 1997 for the Sony Playstation. The game itself is a role-playing video game developed by Square Enix as the seventh installment in the Final Fantasy series.

According to an article in Politico[2], in the spring of 2008 during the Democratic presidential primary, Hilary Clinton supporters began circulating an anonymous email questioning Obama's United States citizenship (shown below). "Barack Obama’s mother was living in Kenya with his Arab-African father late in her pregnancy. She was not allowed to travel by plane then, so Barack Obama was born there and his mother then took him to Hawaii to register his birth"   On October 21st, 2012, Redditor Galactic777 submitted the original instance of Feminist Nazi to Reddit[8] in a post titled “It’s simple, really.” The background image features Layla Subritzky, a cast member from the ninth season of Australia’s Big Brother reality television series, looking upwards with her mouth agape in shock. The top caption read traditional views on chivalry such as pulling out a chair for a woman while the bottom caption said that all of these expectations also come with the expectation of being treated equally. On October 16th, 2012, the second round of the U.S. presidential debate took place at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. During the debate, an undecided voter by the name of Katherine Fenton asked both candidates about pay inequality for women, to which Romney replied with an anecdote about how he sought to form a gender-balanced cabinet during his governorship in Massachusetts: “And I said, ‘Well, gosh, can’t we -- can’t we find some -- some women that are also qualified? I went to a number of women's groups and said, 'Can you help us find folks,' and they brought us whole binders full of women."  On October 19th, 2012, Redditor altmedsol submitted a photo to the /r/pics[1] subreddit titled "Evil Plan," featuring a smiling toddler clasping his hands menacingly (shown below, left).

The now-deleted blog Dave On Wheels[1] was created in August 2012 to chronicle the life of a young deaf man suffering from cerebral palsy[6], a series of disabling motor disorders. In October 2012, two users of The Chive, Sarah Hill[2] and Erin Willet[3] tipped off Chive editor John to Dave On Wheels' Twitter account[4], which had 8 followers at the time. On October 8th, 2012, John posted a collection[5] of screenshots (shown below, left) from Rose's Twitter, followed by a group photo of Chive staff holding up a sign reading "Chive On, Dave!" (shown below, right). The post was shared on Facebook 1.7 thousand times and garnered more than 180 comments.   On March 26th, 2012, an anonymous 4chan[2] user started a thread in the /v/ (video games) board, which included several screen captures from the amusement park management simulation game Roller Coaster Tycoon 2. The images showed a 30,696 foot roller coaster track with 38 riders that took four years of in-game time to complete. The original poster (OP) provided greentext descriptions of the images, explaining that passengers were constantly yelling “I want to get off Mr. Bones Wild Ride.” After the coaster ended, the passengers walked down a large path leading to another entrance to the ride, where they were greeted by an installation of a skeleton with a top hat and a sign reading “The ride never ends.” Prior to being archived, the thread accumulated over 325 responses. Seibu Keisatsu was famous for its quite ridiculous scenario and nonsense rendition, which are very memorable for Japanese TV viewers. Therefore, this show is well-known as the representative of too macho police drama of the 1980s in Japan. The source footage for this series is the opening movie of the 3rd season of the show Seibu Keisatsu Part III, which was aired from April 1983 to October 1984. And its theme song with a heroic melody is "Wonderful Guys" written by the Japanese famous classic/pop music composer Kentaro Haneda.[2] This opening movie is consisting of condensed essences of the show: violence, over-the-top explosions and gunfires by too manly policemen. The sarcastic expression was popularized through a scene from the 2007 comedy film Superbad, in which one of the main characters Seth (played by Jonah Hill) attempts to find a bathroom to wash menstrual fluid from his pants, saying “Fuck me, right?” in response to a girl standing in line (shown below). The movie was released on August 17th, 2007. Seth: "I gotta wash this Merlot off, is this the line?" Girl in line: "What does it look like?" Seth: "Fuck me, right?" [Researching] Originated on 4chan's /v/ board as another form of Reddit Hate, as a meta comment about meme forcing. The "Fuck! I'm in My Twenties" blog launched on May 17th, 2011 with three handwritten entries by Emma Koenig[4] on being a twenty-something living in Manhattan. The first post (shown below, left) lists five ridiculous answers to questions about one's profession, the second (shown below, center) illustrates the author’s conception of what it means to live an adult life in New York city and the third (shown below, right) provides a dating scorecard of the author throughout different stages of the relationship.   Prior to its appearance in image macros, the phrase has been colloquially used to advise someone against over-drinking or scold him or her for losing self-control, comprable to another English idiom "let's call it a day." The earliest known instance of an image featuring the snowclone "Go home X, you're drunk" was posted to the Internet humor site Natuba[1] on October 6th, 2008, which included a photograph of graffiti on a bathroom wall (shown below).   Japan has a very complex railway system, as well as so many railway companies all over the country.[1] Therefore, there are many kinds of announcements in each company and their train lines. Railways and trains are one of the major hobbies in Japan and there are many rail fans. Because of that, several train simulators (such as Densha De Go![2]) just driving a train as directed gains popularity, which is one of the reasons why its market is huge in Japan. In addition, rail fan's information sharing is accelerated by the internet, and the huge amount of picture, visual and audio documents has been archived on the web by them since late 1990s. The seeds of this parody video series is prepared by these rail fan's long-time activities.  "Dancing Mad" is the theme for the battle with Kefka the final boss in Final Fantasy VI which was first released in Japan in 1994.[1] As same as other Final Fantasy series songs, it was written by the Japanese video game composer Nobuo Uematsu.[2] Its full song is 19 minutes long and consists of 4 movements, which is abnormally complex for video game music. Since it gains a large popularity among fans, its arranged version have been included to several subsequent spin-off titles in the series : Dissidia Final Fantasy[3] and Theatrhythm Final Fantasy.[4]. The original "Yes But No" blog[1] was created by Tumblr blogger Christine Chen as a personal project on April 19th, 2011. According to the site description, Chen created the blog to "break assumptions and stereotypes that everyone makes about various cultures, genders [and] sexualities." One of the earliest instances to draw widespread attention was a commentary on the Asians in the Library viral video controversy that erupted a month earlier in March, which went on to gain more than 11,000 likes and reblogs. In its beginning, Chen focused on addressing various misconceptions that are based on ethnicity and geographic locations, but the scope of the blog was eventually broadened to include gender stereotypes, niche hobbies and social interests.

The song was originally written for the group by former member G-TON and was released on May 26th, 2004 as the third single for their debut album "Do You Know?", released under their label Sony Music Entertainment (SME) on June 30th of that year. The song became a smash hit upon its summer release, reaching the top 10 in Oricon music charts in Japan. The song has also appeared within other medias, being used as the second ending theme song for the 2004 Gundam spin-off Superior Defender Gundam Force[2], and featured in the Nintendo DS music-rhythm game Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan in 2005.[3] In the show Breaking Bad, the protagonist’s son Walter White Jr. (played by RJ Mitte) is oftentimes seen eating or talking during breakfast, while remaining virtually non-existent in the main plot involving his father's drug business. The first breakfast scene starring Walt. Jr. was featured in the pilot episode (shown below), originally aired on January 20th, 2008. The earliest known association between Walt Jr. and breakfast scenes was made on October 14th, 2011 in a /tv/ (Television & Film) board discussion thread on 4chan,[5] which requested pictures of Walter Jr. referring to him as “the king of breakfast.”    The image of the Sweet Tea Girl was originally uploaded to somebody's facebook page. It was then used on the Sploder forums with a caption making fun of a member who made a "RIP Dad" article.   The term "karma whore" was used as early as January 2nd, 2000[1] on the tech news site Slashdot in a reposted news story about the filming techniques employed in the 1999 American sci-fi film The Matrix. In the comments, an argument ensued over the authenticity of Slashdotter Signal11's karma rating after a user under the Slashdot alias Anonymous Coward noted the strange discrepancy between the total count of karma and average scores of his posts.  The earliest known instance of the term ovaries being used as a way for female users to express attraction can be found on Urban Dictionary where user Voxy_ uploaded a definition for the phrase 'ovary explosion' on September 29, 2009.[2] The definition explains that the explosion effect is due to the large build-up of estrogen a woman experiences when faced with an attractive individual. Although the earliest known instance is evident in Urban Dictionary, the website Crushable's author Natalie Zutter stated in her article All The Feels! My 10 Favorite Pieces Of Tumblr Lingo, published on August 8, 2012, that ovaries is one of the infamous terms that tumblr is held accountable for.[4] As part of efforts aimed at social car safe and secure, in line with the guidelines that the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport has prescribed concerning quietness such as hybrid vehicles, Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC), at the store on the third-generation Prius that can be mounted approach "vehicle released from August 30th Toyota vehicle dealers throughout the country, through the shop Kyohan Toyota Parts, the "alerting device.

Why don't we come up with a word and spam it all over the internet.This words true meaning will only be known to the few select users that see this post." The original poster's proposal was quickly met by positive responses from others and the thread went on to generate more than 580 text replies and image macros incorporating the word "bigim" prior to being archived.

In 2003, Australian musical comedian Kevin Bloody Wilson released his live album Let Loose Live in the Outback featuring the song "DILLIGAF" which introduces and explains the acronym in its lyrics (shown below).[2] The Arthur Comic Creator was launched by PBS Kids in October 2010. On October 30th, 4chan users on /v/ (video games) started a thread[5] discussing another game on the PBS Kids site, Binky's Facts and Opinions.[3] As the thread progressed, people began exploring other games available on the site and the first instance of the Arthur parody comic was used to tell a GameStop story about D.W. asking the store clerk for a copy of the western action adventure game Red Dead before turning into a teddy bear. August 25th 2012, A video was uploaded to youtube featuring Producer/Actor M A Ananta Jalil Speaking in broken English about his last film "most welcome"[1]. During the interview Mr. Jalil reminisces about an incident where while eating at the local KFC, a group of people jeered at him, calling him "a Bangladeshi hero" (that is to say, he is only good at Bengali style films) to which he retaliates "R U POM GANA? UR MODER POM RUSSIA? " (Are you from Ghana? is your mother from Russia). The video became a hit due to the fail of Mr. Jalil who, whereupon, trying to prove that he was not just "any other Bengali action star" by showcasing his proficiency in English, had failed epically by retorting in utter nonsense. The Interview can be viewed below.    The original video was uploaded to YouTube by Aaron Fink, as "AAFinkle", himself on March 10, 2012 and it received over 65.000 views as of September 14, 2012.

[researching]       In North America, the Internet became readily available for prepubescents with America Online and other similar services in the late 1990s, but the population of the age group saw a visible increase in online presence following the launch of early social networking websites, such as MySpace and Facebook, as well as multiplayer gaming platforms in the early 2000s.  While tutorial videos for applying makeup on oneself have been around since the beginning of Youtube, the first videos in which males apply makeup on others only began to appear in 2010. The first video of this kind was uploaded on January 23rd, 2010 by YouTuber juicytuesday.[1] Titled" "BOYTOY DOES MY MAKEUP!!,"[4] the video featured YouTuber juicytuesday's friend Aaron, a professional makeup artist applying the makeup. The first video to feature a male friend with little experience in applying makeup was uploaded on December 23rd, 2010, by YouTuber andreeaaababy.[2] In the video, andreeaaababy also encourages others to try this with any person who does not know how to apply makeup, in an attempt to start a tag for these type of videos.    As this isn't a specific image meme, it's hard to track the first occurrence of a CM, but this may have started with the "Well, Bye" image. This was well-known on Fark and quickly turned into a CM:  In an /mlp/ thread on 4chan in September 2012, an anonymous user created a thread saying that he would create a song out of posts that ended with dubs (e.g., XXXXX22, XXXXX99, etc.) One post with the phrase "I want to cum inside Rainbow Dash" got dubs and was listed as a verse in the song. Although the originally posting anon didn't return to the thread, another user came, arranged, and produced the song known as "Graaaaavy Train (The /mlp/ Anthem)."[1]  [researching] According to Google search, adult films associated with the keyword "fart porn" have been cached as early as 2004. However, the genre remained little known outside of online fetish sites until the launch of FartBrazil.com[1] on January 27th, 2005. Despite the domain name, similar fetish videos have been shared in other language zones of the Internet.   In 1709, the British literary and society journal The Tatler was launched by Irish writer Richard Steele. The phrase "advise the needful" is contained within Volume 2[19] of the journal: "If you want any further particulars of ditto alderman, daughter, or cat, let me know, and per first will advise the needful: which concludes your loving friend, Lemuel Leger." The expression "do the needful" was later adopted in South Asian English, commonly found in various business correspondences. In 1987, The New York Times[4] published an article titled "On Language; Doing the Needful," which discussed the use of the expression in Indian English. According to Google Cache, “Dipper Goes to Taco Bell” was posted to the online fanfiction database Fanfiction.net[1] on August 23rd, 2012. It was removed seven days later, on August 30th, replaced with a “Code 1” message,[11] which means that the story contains adult-themed content that violates the site's terms of service. The story centers around the Gravity Falls character Dipper Pines[9], who goes to Taco Bell to get food. Upon arriving at the Taco Bell, he orders a taco and takes a bite before suddenly suffering from diarrhea. While in the bathroom, Dipper ends up getting turned on by his feces and various other bodily fluids. After a while, Dipper accidentally cuts himself and dies from loss of blood. Later his twin sister Mabel[10] discovers his corpse and ends up getting killed by a Taco Bell employee, who afterwards cleans up the bathroom stall and disposes of the corpses by turning them into tacos. In 1985, the show Saturday Live was broadcast on the British television channel, Channel 4. The show was comprised of various comedians performing stand up acts or skits, along with music performances as well. It was heavily inspired by the American show, Saturday Night Live. One of the comedians who performed on the show was Harry Enfield. He didn't perform skits or stand up as himself, instead creating characters for him to act and tell jokes as. The most notable and popular of these characters was Loadsamoney. Loadsamoney's character was an obnoxious plasterer from the South of England. He spoke in a thick Cockney accent and would always be seen with a pile of pound notes in his hand. Loadsamoney's act was based around him boasting about his wealth and how much money he had. Harry Enfield and Loadsamoney were a huge success, being regulars on the show and continuing to appear on the follow up to Saturday Live, Friday Live. In 1988, Harry Enfield recorded a song named after the character, with the full title "Loadsamoney (Doin' Up the House)". The song was also a big success, making it to number 2 in the UK music charts. Loadsamoney was also performed on Friday Live and Top of the Pops.  Pictures and videos of Venus were uploaded on August 14th, 2012 Facebook page titled "Venus's Page – Amazing Chimera cat"[1] and YouTube channel VenusMommy (shown below, left). The cat quickly spread across Facebook the animal photo blogosphere, even leading to discussions (shown below, right) regarding the authenticity of the photographs and extensive coverage from news media outlets and scientific explanations of chimera cats in the blogosphere. While the owner of Venus remains anonymous, but the name of the cat is said to have been inspired by an astrological essay titled "Venus: The Two Faced Goddess," which includes the story of Venus whose side facing the Sun alternates in between day and night.     The phrase was supposedly uttered by the villain character Frieza in the Japanese anime series Dragon Ball Z. During his pinnacle battle scene against the protagonists, Frieza boasts his capacity of strength by saying "You FOOL! This isnt even my final form! Wait until you see my TRUE power! HYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!" before morphing into his next level incarnation. According to Redditor johns1993, this is an example of the Mandela Effect, a collective misremembering. They write: Although unclear exactly when or where the phrase began to gain significance as a popular catchphrase, its earliest known instance can be found in the comments section of a Rule34 post submitted on January 1st, 2011. The post featured an image of a mixed media sculpture that consists of Disney's Toy Story character Woody and a wall of plastic boobs. The image was captioned with the phrase "this isn't even my final form" months later and uploaded onto FunnyJunk on September 24th, 2011 (shown below).    On September 12th, 2002, the American television series CSI: Miami premiered on CBS.[1] One of the show's many tropes includes Lt. Caine (portrayed by David Caruso), the lead investigator, and his wry, humorous comments about a victim he is investigating (example below). After making such comments, he puts on his sunglasses, which cues the show's theme song, "Won't Get Fooled Again" by The Who, opening with Who singer Roger Daltry's cry, "Yeah!" Some time in 2008, an artist going under the pseudonym Darrow on the Starmen.net forum[2], created a forum topic for his new comic called The Chosen Four. The first post featured the cover page and the first and second pages to the comic. Over time, more and more pages were added by Darrow, all being posted on the forum. Starmen.net staff would soon come across these comics and feature them as some of the best fan comics in their collection[1]. While the exact origin remains unknown, a YouTube video is credited as the beginning of the fad. Uploaded on November 4th, 2006, the video entitled "CSI Miami – Endless Caruso One Liners" shows a montage roll of CSI: Miami actor David Caruso saying a corny one-liner just before the intro song of the CSI ("Won't Get Fooled Again" by The Who): Because of Caruso's overuse of both one liners and wearing his sunglasses, some people were quick to criticize the actor's talents. However, fans of the show and other YouTubers found the video hilarious, who began flooding the comments section with "YEEEAAAHHH!", the segue between Caruso's one liners. The actual use of the phrase "YEEEAAAHHH!" didn't begin until YouTuber "MrQuick927" posted the following comment:    On August 21st, 2012, the Spanish publication Heraldo[2] published an article about a failed painting restoration performed by an elderly woman named Cecilia Jiménez. Jiménez wished to restore a damaged fresco created by Spanish painter Elías García Martínez named Ecce Homo ("Behold the Man")[8], which was donated to the Santuario de Misericordia Church in the Spanish town of Borja. According to the church, Jiménez restored the painting without permission. However, she has claimed the priest allowed her to do so. After assessing the damage caused by the restoration, the church announced they would be hiring a professional to attempt to undo the botched job. Following the press coverage of the painting, Jimenez was reported to have been suffering from crippling anxiety attacks, reluctant to eat or leave her home.[17]  Redditor Wade_W_Wilson submitted a post titled "Office Thoughts"[1] on August 16th, 2012, which included an image macro with the caption "If I set this building on fire / I wonder which coworkers would escape" (shown below). Within five days, the post received over 9,850 up votes and 150 comments. One of the earliest mentions of the phrase "wall of text" appeared in the title of a spam message posted on three unrelated newsgroups on November 21st, 1996 by a company named Valucard International. The post, "Wall of text with subtle picture," was shared on alt.books.phil-k-dick[1], alt.sci.time-travel[2] and alt.ascii-art[3] with the summary "ascii art disguised as screenful of mumblejumble" and a keyword, "oh my god." On August 6th, 2012, Tumblr user badcgijosh posted[1] a picture of himself posing as if he was running with a piece of toast in his mouth followed by the caption, "Shit, I'm late for anime school." As of August 28th, the post has 44,961 notes.    The earliest known mention of Yaoi hands appeared on the Otaku message board MangaFox[4] on March 23rd, 2010, in reference to art featured in the manga Junjou Romantica: Pure Romance.[5][6] While the image is no longer accessible, the description pointed out the oversized hands depicted on the characters Usami and Misaki.   Senpai[1], sometimes spelled "sempai", is a Japanese honorific term used when speaking to someone of an elevated social status in schools, dojos or sports clubs. The term is usually reserved for mentors, and does not apply to authority figures such as teachers or bosses. Romantic anime and manga often feature stories involving infatuations with senpai.[2] While the senpai concept had already been mentioned on Tumblr[3], the specific catchphrase did not appear until August 8th, 2012, when the single serving site "Has Senpai Noticed Me Yet?"[4] was created.  Kirby, is a videogame series created by HAL Laboratory[1] and Nintendo. One of the main elements of the game is the fact that Kirby can inhale his enemies, thus absorbing their abilities to use for himself. However, this element wasn't introduced until the second game in the series, Kirby's Adventure[2].     The concept of entering or moving into a "wrong neighborhood," referring to a state of being racially outnumbered, has been explored through commentaries on interracial relations by American stand-up comedians, as well as sitcoms, music videos, and comedy movies such as "The Mighty Ducks".[11] The earliest known image macro instance of a clowder (shown below) was posted via FunnyJunk[1] on June 11th, 2009.  During the 2012 Olympic Games, Mo Farah won the gold medal in the 10,000-meter race on August 4th with a time of 27:30:42.[2] This marked the first time an athlete from Britain won a gold medal for this event. On August 11th, Farah took home a second gold medal for the 5000-meter race[3], becoming one of a handful of people who have won both races at the same Olympics. As he crossed the finish line, he was photographed with his arms spread making an incredibly surprised expression with his mouth agape.[4] On August 12th, British graphic designer Luke Harvey[5] created a single topic blog titled Mo Farah Running Away From Things[6], initially posting an image of Farah's race-winning reaction photoshopped over a scene from the 1993 action film Jurassic Park, to make it appear as if the Olympian was running away from a Tyrannosaurus Rex. According to various accounts, the "Skull Trumpet" sprite was first introduced through 3D Movie Maker, a computer graphics software program developed and released by Microsoft's "Microsoft Kids" subsidiary in 1995, and spread through various websites around the same time as when the Dancing Baby animation became popular. However, online interest in the sprite image reached its peak more than a decade later after it was uploaded by YouTuber Piepuppy89 in early 2011 (shown below), though it has since been removed after the account was deactivated in August of 2012. Lil Bub was born on June 21st, 2011 in the state of Indiana. On November 8th, 2011, a video titled "good job bub.3gp" was uploaded by YouTuber LilBubBub, featuring a video of the cat stalking the camera before pouncing on it. The same day, the Lil Bub Tumblr[1] blog was launched, which highlighted the same YouTube video in the first post. On May 24th, 2000, the season three finale of Dawson's Creek, entitled "True Love," aired in the United States. In the episode, Dawson ends tells his longtime romantic partner Joey (played by Katie Holmes) to be with their mutual friend Pacey.[1] At the end of their conversation, he breaks down in tears and says, "Just go."[10] Six years later, on December 6th, 2006, YouTuber notdatbigyet posted a video entitled "Dawson's Crying Face." The post (shown below) received more than 880,000 views in 12 years. The still image used in the image macro was taken from Spongebob Squarepants' Season 3, Episode 8 titled “No Weenies Allowed,” which originally aired on March 15th, 2002. In the episode, Spongebob tries to get into a stereotypically tough club known as The Salty Spitoon with his friend, Sandy. After repeatedly being turned down by the bouncer, Spongebob tells him a story about a time he stubbed his toe while watering his spice garden and that he "only cried for twenty minutes." On August 14th, 2012, an image macro titled “Tough Spongebob” was submitted to the /r/AdviceAnimals[1] subreddit with a caption asserting that the poster had deleted a saved Pokemon game file that had a completed Pokedex and only cried for 20 minutes (shown below). However, the post only received 8 upvotes and 7 points overall prior to being archived.    Though the phrase itself predates internet history, One of the earliest recorded examples of the image macro was in July 16th, 2012 on a WeKnowMemes post titled "Best Swag Memes"[4]. The post contain several swag related memes, among them is a picture of a boy proposing his "swag" to a girl which is then followed with the image macro.  Stock images of nebulae taken by the Hubble Space Telescope have been circulating on Tumblr[15] since as early as January 2010, while inspirational photo quotes featuring pictures of nebulae have appeared as early as February 2010.[10] Single topic blogs dedicated to making fun of this trend were created as early as August 2010, starting with the launch of That’s A Fucking Nebula[11], followed by Fuck Yeah Text Over Nebulas[12] and Text in Space.[13] Meanwhile, GIFs utilizing images of nebulae began appearing on Tumblr as as early as December 7th, 2010, when Tumblr user VeryCherryPeel[14] posted an animated GIF showing a silhouette of two people in a sexual position with its foreground obscured by flashing nebulae.  A Roomba[13] is an autonomous robotic vacuum cleaner manufactured and distributed by iRobot. Since its introduction in 2002, the home appliance product has sold at least 6 million units and established itself as one of the first commercially successful first-generation domestic robots. On March 6th, 2012, Redditor buswork submitted a photo to the /r/pics[1] subreddit of a Roomba with a kitchen knife taped to the top in a post titled "Home Security." Within five months, the post received over 23,000 up votes and 550 comments. On August 13 of 2012, an user posted a 'Competitive Pokémon Moveset', switching 'Dragon Pulse' (an actual move) for Dragon Pause. Then, the thread derailed parodying 'Dragon Pause' and how the move works. [1] Dragon Pause Type: Dragon Category: Status PP: 5 (max 7) Power: - Accuracy: -% Effect: The turn Dragon Pause is used, the user pauses. At the first of the next turn, all Dragon type pokémon restore all their HP, but they can't do any move. The earliest instance of the exploitables appearing date back to 2007 in a thread on 4chan.[2]     On February 21, 2010, YouTube user PrawnBoy101 uploaded a video titled "The Result of Boredom". The 24-second video clip features The Heavy from Team Fortress 2 riding a Wailord through the ocean, with Avast Your Ass playing in the background. In the video's description, he dared the viewers to make a video response, and he supplied two music tracks he recommended they use (which are "Gang Plank Galleon" from Donkey Kong Country and "Sewer Surfin'" from TMNT: Turtles in Time, respectively). Within the first 24 hours after it was uploaded, the video generated over 6,000 views. The first video response for The Result of Boredom was "the result of needing a new cheap car" by YouTube user wadloperz, which features the Heavy driving a green car on the ocean before crashing into a boat.  The phrase "Hi, I am X and This is Jackass" was first introduced as the opening line of the MTV reality series Jackass[1] by American stuntman and actor Johnny Knoxville. Since the airing of the pilot episode in late 2000, the show became a mainstream hit and gained a cult following for staging a variety of dangerous, crude and often self-harming stunts and pranks set in the American suburbs. During its original run from October 2000 to February 2002, Knoxville's quote grew into an iconic slogan associated with the revival of American daredevil entertainment and became reiterated by other guests and celebrities in numerous episodes of the TV series. The word “stahp” is an intentionally misspelled phonetic transcription of the word “stop,” which was introduced earlier in August 2011 through Stawp it, Rahn, another image macro series that pokes fun at the MTV's Jersey Shore cast member Sammi "Sweetheart" Giancola's accent (shown below, left). The earliest known captioned instance of the series based on a photograph of a scornful-looking dog (shown below, right) was uploaded by Tumblr[1] user jmiliam on March 18th, 2012. Within six months, the post received over 124,300 notes. On October 23rd, 2010, the photo blog People WTF[3] published a post titled "A Wigger Kid With His Self-Timer Camera Killing Time", which highlighted two photographs of a teenage boy posing in front of the camera (shown below). On June 24th, 2012, Redditor huisme submitted an image macro to the /r/AdviceAnimals[2] with the caption "'I run this fucking town!' / Grounded for swearing", which reached the front page receiving over 6,400 up votes and 75 comments within one month.    In 2003 a user by the name of “Netspooky” posted a flash animation on the Taiwanese website, Kimo, under the name “kikia”. In the video it shows a poorly drawn little boy sitting in a field, it then goes to show the boy, this time walking in a market place. And as these clips are shown, writing in Taiwanese (Or Chinese) appears. After that the screen turns white, and a horrifying face from the videogame Fatal Frame II is shown, along with a distorted scream. The video abruptly ends with the word “Kikia” flashing on to the screen. Omochikaeri (translates to I'm taking it home with me!) is the catch phrase of Rena Ryuguu from Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni. She says it whenever she sees something "cute" though her definition of cute can sometimes be quite different from others. Some of the "cute stuff" she finds is actually from the dump. She first says it in the Spiritied Away by the Demon chapter. Her habit of taking "cute things" home with her is revealed to have dark origins in the Atonement chapter. It is essentially her "marking her territory" to protect the sanctaty of her home, especially from other females as the result of a betrayal of her trust by her mother. This territorial behaviour has no true exceptions, not even for Keiichi, who she may or may not be attracted to (its very ambiguous). Whenever she goes into "cute mode" Rena gains super human strength and reflexes, being capable of knocking people out and breaking restraints. The first known image[1] (below) was uploaded on Aug 20, 2011 to the Spanish-language meme website desmotivaciones.es by user K.White. The image is a classic demotivational poster , showing 3 tubes of kids' toothpaste, followed by the caption (translated) "He who didn't eat his toothpaste didn't have a childhood". The first website to use the spelling "Rahn" to mimic Sammi's speech was discussion community Crasstalk[1], who used it during a liveblog of the Jersey Shore season 4 premiere on August 4, 2011. It originally appeared in a list of things viewers could expect to see in the first ten minutes of the episode, which stated that Sammi would spend 20 minutes calling out Ron's name and asking him to assure her of his love. However, this particular spelling was not used in image macros until September 2nd, 2011[2], when a still shot of teary-eyed Sammy after fighting with Ronnie was paired with the catchphrase. The image originated from a Season 4 episode titled “And The Wall Won.”[9] The post has since been deleted. (In research, trying to find original comment with the term and the exact date the feature was introduced.) The "Show the Comment" feature was introduced in late March 2012 to give users an easier way to see the comment that a user was replying to.  An image was posted on 9gag with the title "My friend, call it Motivational Mike" and received over 23,000 likes in less than a day. It is still too early to write anymore as there are no derivatives at the time, however it is clear this meme will become popular The first known usage appears to be as a pseudonym used by someone discussing strategy for the Pokemon TCG[1] (below) on July 3rd, 1999. However, it is unknown if this is the first usage. The word "fusking" stems from a Danish word[12] used to describe a person who was secretly doing work outside of their established trade. The first code written using this name was created by CarthagTuek, the handle of a Danish man named Mikkel Eriksen, early as 2002. He announced the third version of a script site known as Fusker on his blog Sensible Erection[2] on March 5th, 2002. The site, which is only now available as an archive[13], utilized a Perl CGI script that was coded similarly to a UNIX/Linux cURL tool to find a library of similarly named files on any image hosting website. It was initially made to scrape porn sites which had sample photos in a public album, using subsequent file names to find the paid photos.  On August 5th, 2012, Maroney performed a nearly flawless vault during the 2012 Olympic Games in London, England, leading many to believe she would win the gold medal for the competition. During her second vault, Maroney failed to reach enough height to land on her feet and subsequently fell on her backside. After receiving a total score of 15.083, Maroney ended up taking the silver medal for the competition. While on the winner's podium, Bryan Snyder of the international news agency Reuters took a photograph of Maroney making a scowling expression. On August 7th, the single topic blog McKayla is Not Impressed was launched on Tumblr[8] to showcase photoshopped images of Maroney's glare set against historical or spectacular scenes in the background.   On March 9th, 2012, the blog for the American cuisine restaurant Crave[9] highlighted a photograph of the owner and chef posing with the Miami Heat basketball players LeBron James (shown left), Dwayne Wade (shown middle) and Chris Bosh (shown right). In the photo, James could be seen wearing a smile with his jaw jutting in a peculiar fashion, reminiscent of the trollface illustration. Photoshopped versions of the image are rumored to have started in the /sp/ (sports) board on 4chan, but early threads have not been archived. On May 26th, YouTuber NowItsInTheTrashCan uploaded a video titled "lelbron.gif", featuring a rotating animation of James' head accompanied by the song "Ridin' Spinners" by the rap group Three Six Mafia.    In the mid to late 90's, a website called "Mewthree and Frogglet's Pokémon Factory" was launched to create an open forum for development and archival of fan-made Pokemon sprites. The site name was later simplified to "Pokémon Factory"[1]. According to the site description:     On January 18th, 1969, episode 19 "To Cage a Spider" of season two of the 1967 series Spider-Man, colloquially known as 60's Spider-Man, premiered.[3] In one scene of the episode, Spider-Man is shown lying on a sickbed at a hospital. Starting at least as early as November 2007, the word "cancer" has been used as a metaphor for poor quality content on 4chan's /b/ and other boards. The spread of the word is mostly associated with the popularization of the phrase The Cancer That Is Killing /b/. In April 2009, Marvel started streaming episodes of 60's Spider-Man. In the following months, the show gained viral popularity among users on 4chan's /co/ board, with users posting threads with still images from the show, with users also making image macros based on it. In one of such threads, an anonymous user created an image macro based a still image of Spider-Man lying sick in bed from the episode "To Cage a Spider" of the series, captioning it "That Post Gave Me Cancer" (shown below). The earliest found reposts of the image were made by an anonymous JoyReactor[1] user on March 30th, 2010, and on 4chan image mirror website Chan4Chan[2] on November 30th, 2010. The screen capture, which shows the Marvel superhero lying on the sickbed at the hospital, was originally taken from an episode of the 1967 Spider-Man TV series titled "To Cage a Spider." Usain Bolt first introduced his iconic victory pose in August 2008 at the Beijing Olympics after finishing the 100 meters event with a new world record of 9.69 seconds. Although Bolt's post-race ceremony was initially criticized by the International Olympic Committee chief Jacques Rogge as "showboating" and "lacking respect," Jamaica's star runner continued to celebrate his victory with the same gesture. At around 1:30 a.m. (ET) on August 6th, 2012, NASA's first nuclear-powered Mars rover The Curiosity successfully made its landing on Aeolis Palus in Gale Crater after more than nine months of journey since its launch in November 2011. Described as the most technologically advanced mission to Mars yet, the landing event was broadcast in real-time via television and livestream, garnering much attention from the news media as well as online communities and the tech news blogosphere. While the tension remained high in NASA's Mission Control center during the last minutes leading up to the safe landing of the Curiosity, one youthful staffer sporting a star-decorated mohawk cut captivated the attention of viewers at home. The catchphrase's has an arguable origin, but it has been noted that it started being use after 4chan's notoriety grew massive prevalence through the internet.  The line was first introduced in the theatrical trailer for The Dark Knight Rises[1] that ran before IMAX screenings of Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol. Upon the global release of the film on July 19th, 2012, it was met by critical acclaims and positive box office sales, in spite of the tragic massacre that unfolded at a theater in Aurora, Colorado during a midnight screening of the film. In the following weeks of July, various image macros and photoshopped images featuring The Dark Knight references began to emerge on Reddit[5] and Tumblr.[9] The Facebook fan page[4] titled after Bain's quote was created by Craig Harrison on December 19th, 2011, but it remained inactive until after the film's release on July 24th, 2012.        According to Google cached results, a page titled "Fat Girl" was created on the image macro website Meme Generator[1] as early as February 24th, 2010, with the first instance containing the caption "She told me I was fat / so I ate her" (shown below, left). The original image macro template featured a photo of a blonde woman with a purple and blue color wheel without the Scumbag Hat exploitable added on. On March 31st, 2011, FunnyJunk[3] user shadythomas uploaded a compilation of notable examples in a post titled "Scumbag fatgirl", which included a new version of the template with the superimposed scumbag hat (shown below, right). [Still researching]  On July 21st, 2009, Nico Nico Douga (NND) user 柳～やなぎ～ さん uploaded a video titled Chen Sliding in (すべりこむちぇん)[1] (shown below, left), where Chen, a catgirl character from the Touhou Project, is sliding through a box in a similar manner to one seen in the August 2008 Maru video "滑り込むねこ。" (shown below, right). In making the video, 柳～やなぎ～ さん used the same music from the 2008 video game Monster Hunter Freedom Unit that can be found in an older NND fad Kyu! Kyu! Kyu! Nya~! Dance. On August 1st, 2012, London’s Mayor Boris Johnson was scheduled to test out a 320 meter (1050 feet) zip line in Victoria Park, where the Olympic Games were being held. Approximately three quarters of the way across, Johnson lost his momentum and got stuck, dangling 10 meters (33 feet) above the ground while holding on to two Union Jack flags.[1] As the mayor waited for assistance to arrive, numerous spectators and news reporters snapped photos and video of the trapped mayor, tweeting them with the hashtags #DanglingBoris[3] and #DangleBoris.[11]   Dragon dildos were first made available to the public on the adult sex toy website Bad-Dragon.[1] On December 7th, 2007, Bad-Dragon co-founder Varka announced plans to create a business involving the sale and manufacture of dragon-like sex toys on his website Herpy.net.[2] On June 26th, 2008, a sex shop based in Phoenix, Arizona launched the online shopping site Bad-Dragon.com, featuring a variety of sex toys including phalluses shaped to resemble the male genitals of dragons, horses, dolphins, orcas, canines, wallabies and cephalopods. On July 19th, 2012, Prince Charles and Camilla visited a youth festival for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee at Saumarez Park in St. Peter Port, Channel Islands. While attending the event, Charles partook in a round of Parachute games and even showed off a jig, which was captured on camera by journalists and reporters.[1][2] On July 21st, B3ta forum member chthonic started a thread titled "Photoshop Prince Charles"[3] with an exploitable cutout of Prince Charles doing the jig and challenged other members to create and share their own photoshopped versions using the image.   The sketch was shown within British television on the Monty Phython episode '"Face the Press" which first aired in 1970  On July 30th, 2012, Tumblr [1] user windshieldviper uploaded a set of screen captures from the broadcast coverage of Men's Olympic Diving events with the caption “the score bars are leaving much to the imagination." The oddly-timed photos showed several male Olympic divers standing with a scorecard banner displayed over their waists, accompanied by the me gusta reaction face (shown below). Within three days, the post received over 66,000 notes.    Fuji TV began airing the live-action television version of Life on June 30th, 2007, which ran until September 15th that year. The show featured insidious depictions of bullying and explicit content involving several troubled high school students. According to a Japanese Wikipedia[2] article for the manga, the television station received more than 2000 complaints from viewers during the program, which prevented the studio from rebroadcasting the show on other channels. The infamous remark "There's no f**king seat for you!" was first spoken by Manami Anzai, the antagonist and the leader of a bullying group, to Ayumu Shiiba, the protagonist of this drama, in a scene where she throws Shiiba's seat and textbooks from a terrace during the first episode. The phrase was uttered a second time during the end of the final episode aired on September 15th, 2007, in a scene that inspired the video fad.   TVCMs for Kabikiller have been aired in Japan since 1980s, changed several times and continued telling people its strong bactericidal power annihilating all molds by the roots. In late 2000s, new TVCMs started to be aired, which were narrated by a middle-aged male's voice and set his shouting of "Kabikiller" to the sound logo for the product. For example, this video below is a bath room version. Transcript: Gomu pakkin no kabi wa nega Hukai. (Molds are deeply digging into rubber seals.) Dakara ochinainda… (Indeed. so hard to remove…) Konnna tokini wa Kabikiller no shintouryoku (On such occasions, take Kabikiller's strong penetrating power) Kabi no ne no oku no oku made kyouryoku shintou (Deeply penetrates to the roots of molds) Gomu pakkin mo sukkiri (Cleans up even molds in rubber seals.) Sintouryoku nara Kabikiller (Kabikiller, the best penetrating power) On NND, 2 early instances of MAD videos reusing this TVCM series were already uploaded in late 2008. One was a derivative of the Paffendorf Dance[2], the other was a musical remix with a soundtrack from Kirby's Dream Land 3.[3] Each of them rendered surrealistic lulz by a little manly shouting of the sound logo.  The song "Gangnam Style" was written, produced, and recorded as the lead single of PSY 6 (Six Rules), Part 1 the sixth studio album of South Korean singer and rapper PSY, who is best known for his quick-witted sense of humor and comical dance moves. The song was released on July 15th, 2012 along with the music video via PSY's official YouTube channel. Upon its release, the song took off on virtually all Korean billboard charts, portal search sites and online music stores, but it began garnering international attention after the music video went viral on YouTube during the third week of July 2012. The video continued gaining viral momentum at an average rate of more than nine million views per day in the span of two months, surpassing Carly Rae Jepsen's "Call Me Maybe" to reach the number one position on the YouTube Top 100 Music Videos chart during the last week of August. By mid-September, PSY's "Gangnam Style" overtook LMFAO's "Party Rock Anthem" as the most liked video on the site with more than 1.6 million likes. Maru was born on May 24th, 2007. His anonymous owner launched the photo blog "I am Maru"[2] in November 2007 to curate photos of his cat. Maru's official YouTube channel mugumogu[1] was created almost a year later in July 2008, showcasing Maru's daily adventures in short video format. As of May 2013, mugumogu's channel has more than 330,000 subscribers, 210 million views overall and averages approximately 118,000 views per day. At one point, the channe was the 8th Most Subscribed channel and 11th Most Viewed YouTube channel of all time in Japan. On July 27th, 2012, Queen Elizabeth II attended the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics at the Olympic Stadium. Her entrance to the event was nothing short of a spectacle and a departure from her public image, featuring a pre-recorded film starring Daniel Craig as James Bond and the Queen herself, followed by a live parachuting performance high above the stadium by a stuntman double. In contrast to her energetic arrival, however, she appeared to be bored or even disgruntled at times, particularly during the procession of nations (shown above, left). Within the hour, some candid photographs of the dour-faced Queen began circulating across internet news sites and blogs. At around 10 p.m. local time, while the ceremony was still ongoing, Redditor tf2fan submitted an image post titled "The Queen isn't enjoying the Olympic Ceremony" to /r/AdviceAnimals, featuring a photograph of the scornful looking Queen in the V.I.P section with the caption "Kill them all, Phillip. Kill them all" (shown above, right). Meanwhile, the title "One is Not Amused" had been previously used to describe photos of unhappy looking Queen Elizabeth II in an article published by DailyMail in October 2008.  On April 30th, 2012, the official YouTube account of the studio that produced The Dark Knight Rises, Warner Bros. Pictures, released the third trailer for the film. In the trailer, the character Batman (played by Christian Bale) asks Bane, "Why don't you just kill me?" Bane responds, "Your Punishment Must Be More Severe." The trailer (shown below) received more than 33 million views in six years. On July 20th, 2012, the website Meme Generator [1] posted a screen capture of Bane from the scene. The phrase became a popular caption for the image (shown below). Redditor lyinsteve submitted a photograph of Mitt Romney with the caption "Why don't poor people / just buy more money?" (shown below, left) to the /r/funny[1] subreddit on February 18th, 2012. Within five months, the post accumulated over 4,200 up votes and 70 comments. On April 27th, Redditor askins4trouble submitted a post to the /r/AdviceAnimals[2] subreddit titled "Relatable Romney", which included an image macro expressing a similar sentiment with the caption "I understand your problems / it costs a lot to fill up all my Cadillacs" (shown below, right).  On July 14th, 2012, Tumblr[1] user majortvjunkie posted a photoshopped Animorphs book cover featuring the rapper Pitbull transforming into a pitbull dog with the caption "To understand the future we must go back in time." The post was heavily reblogged, receiving more than 39,000 notes within six days. However, it has since been deleted. The origin of this meme is currently unknown, but traces have been found that date back to before 2000. One of the most well known jokes is: "Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to the other side!" There was a book published in 1990 titled A dictionary of Catch Phrases, British and American , by Eric Partridge. This featured some "Anti-Jokes" throughout the book, and seems to be on the the first sources for Anti-Jokes. On July 15th, 2012, Michelle Jenneke, a hurdler from Kenthurst, New South Wales, Australia, ran in the 2012 IAAF World Junior Championships 100-meter hurdles event. Before the race began, Jenneke was filmed performing her warm-up exercise routine by jumping up and down and shimmying her legs while smiling (shown below). After the race commenced, Jenneke finished in first place. The warm-up dance was subsequently set to the Italian singer Sabrina Salerno's 1987 single "Boys" and uploaded to Vimeo by the Dutch sports news site Losse Veter[4] the same day (shown above). Several copies of the video were reuploaded to YouTube, with one mirror receiving more than 21.4 million views in the next seven months. The TVCM began to be aired in December 2011, which was for university hopefuls. In the TVCM, a highschool student boy is standing on a bank of a river, and screaming the passion to the campus life, with a lot of soul. But, the narrator says strictly: "You can't pass entrance exams only by motivation." Transcript: Demo… Zettai… Goukaku Shite Yasuzooooh!!! Mattero Kyannpasu Raihu!!! Ore ha Yaruze Zettai Ukatte Miseruze Goukaku Shiteyaru…. Uaaaaaaaaahh!!! Juken Ha Kiai Dake Deha Norikire Nai. Attoteki Mondai Ryoku, Tetteiteki Tensaku Ryoku Koukousei No Tame No Zetto Kai.

You can't pass entrance exams only by motivation. Supreme examination design, Thorough teaching ability Z-KAI, for high school students.  The phrase originated from an episode of the animated television series The Fairly OddParents titled "Father Time," which originally aired on Nickelodeon on April 20, 2001.[1] It is spoken by the father of Timmy Turner, the protagonist of the series. The original scene takes place in an alternate future where Timmy's father never won his prized childhood marathon trophy and became a dictator. The scene was uploaded by YouTuber xspiritombx[5] on September 1st, 2011. As of March 2014, the video has gained over 600,000 views. The 5 episodes were aired in a scripted reality TV show called "X-Diaries" in the german TV broadcaster "Radio Television Luxemburg 2" (short: RTL 2, RTL II) from August 30, 2010 until September 3, 2010. The episodes were then uploaded to YouTube on October 22, 23 and 24, 2010 by MVPtr4sh and all of them gained over 100.000 views. Then YouTuber marciiiiiiii uploaded 24 individual scenes from the episodes on December 17, 2010 until January 10, 2011. The last uploaded scene is the Bester Mann video, which gained until in the middle of July 2012 over 286.100 views.   Prior to the emergence of spaghetti stories in 2010, various excerpts from Eminem's "Lose Yourself," including "mom's spaghetti," have been used as the title of blog posts or discussion threads, most notably on the automobile enthusiast forum LS1TECH[3] in April 2003, 4chan's /r9k/ board[4] in April 2008 and FARK's current event forum[5] in November 2011. Like most spaghetti stories that came before, the "Mom's Spaghetti" copypasta originated from 4chan sometime in early 2012 with the earliest known mention found in a greentext story (shown below) posted on April 19th. At one point in time a kitten in a cage was filmed and killed by the same methods as the picture. The video was removed, however a separate image remains and no video footage has been found of the 'previous' Zippocat. EDIT: There is found footage of the video. No links to the video will be posted. There is no other information other than it (the image) formed around 4chan, and the one who posted it is unknown. Not much information can be gathered as the picture eventually stopped circulating and used casually. It is now used as a shock image or a troll post. Zippocat is a name cat which derives from the nickname of the cat that was killed by the lighter fluid and Zippo Lighter.[1]   The quote "well, that escalated quickly, really that got out of hand fast!* was originally heard in a scene from the 2004 comedy film Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, in which Ron Burgundy and his co-anchors discuss their previous encounter of a violent midday brawl with the rival KQHS Channel 9 Evening News Team. Along with many other memorable lines from the movie, Ron Burgundy's afterthought continued to be quoted in various comedy and movie discussion forums, as well as in comments of news articles and discussion threads as a general notion that something has gone out of control quickly. The earliest known use of the phrase outside of its original context can be found on the webcomic blog I Heart Eddit in a comic titled "In Which Eddie & Logan Make Like A Banana" posted on December 2nd, 2007.  The original image features a horribly drawn Graystripe with his name above him. The original image was captured from a scene in the 1998 Coen Brothers comedy film The Big Lebowski in which the character Walter Sobchak becomes frustrated by another character stepping over the line while bowling. After expressing his frustration to his teammates, he draws a hand gun and asks "Am I the only one around here who gives a shit about the rules?" (shown at :57 below). The first image macro using the quote was posted by Redditor BFM11 to the /r/AdviceAnimals[1] subreddit titled "Angry Walter" on March 24th, 2012. The caption expressed the poster's frustration with the misuse of the word "literally" and used a screen capture from a different scene in the movie. On June 1st, 1990, the film Total Recall was released in the United States.[1] In the film, the character Quaid (portrayed by Arnold Schwarzenegger) attempts to enter Mars in a disguise. When customs asks how long he will be staying on Mars, Quaid's disguise, a robotic middle-aged woman (portrayed by Priscilla Allen), malfunctions and begins repeating "two weeks." On November 22nd, 2006, YouTuber David Inman uploaded the earliest available clip of the sign. The post received more than 764,000 views in less than 15 years (shown below). The acronym was referenced online as early as October 1999 in an article on the Internet Chess Club[1] website about gaming etiquette. The author explains that receiving a “GG” when playing chess can be a touchy subject because chess players are often sore losers. Some people get extremely annoyed at those who were raised with good manners. I confess I am one of them. But why should my blood boil after someone sends me a, "gg" or a "tx"? Isn't the person just showing good sportsmanship? Like many chess players, I am a very sore loser. The last thing in the world I want to hear is "good game". Was it really a good game? Did I not just hang my queen? How was this a good game? Thanks for letting me know what a good game it was for YOU, buddy.  Van Darkholme appeared on NND as the first Asian actor in the Wrestling Series through a video posted from one of the series on April 21st, 2008,[2] which was taken from 1999 American gay porn video LORDS OF THE LOCKER ROOM. This video soon caught much attention among Wrestling Series fanatics because of his eccentric costume and his impressive F-word cuss. Transcript: Following this, many videos featuring his bondage costumes and fetish play were uploaded continually. Those videos became to the popular sub-series in Wrestling Series named "BONDAGE M@STER", usually called BONM@S for short. In those days, he also had another nickname: TDN Kosugi (TDNコスギ)[3] or simply TDN. This was because his looks resembled Kazuhito Tadano,[4] who was called TDN in the other online gay porn phenomena A Midsummer Night's Lewd Dream and Japanese American martial arts actor Kane Kosugi[5] for their sensibilities. The fat nigger know as JabberHash wrote he would commit suicide to prove he wasn't a pussy, Then they made the series. With the developments in Billy's "Gachimuchi" phenomena, many kind of creators had joined into it and released their own works. Among them, amatuer/semi-professional music composers and DJs introduced techno/house music to this phenomena, and have been making orthodox dance music remixes sampling the voice of Billy and others, and competing its quality. This music movement gradually began in early 2008, and was led to a substantial increase in popularity by the song uploaded to NND in July 14th, 2008.[1] Though the original video caught no attention and was soon deleted, it spreaded to the web by the promoting style video by another user on October 8th, 2008.[2] The song is "Billy Herrington is Still Alive !" by a user called Macedonia. This meme started on a single-topic Tumblr page called "Advice Lovecraft". Users can submit their own versions generated via MemeGenerator. It has shown up on several HP Lovecraft blogs and threads. This is the photo of Lovecraft used in the meme: The source video for this fad was uploaded as a part of wrestling series to Nico Nico Douga (NND) in October 11th, 2009[1], and it is a compilation of some guys dancing scenes splitted from 2002 gay porn video "Max Men: Strip Fantasies, Volume One".[2] In this video, a Czech actor Jirka Kalvoda is performing a weird dance: sexy moving with rubbing his crotch by his shirt (shown below, left). On NND, he is better known as his nickname "Skull Nipple: Golden Horn" (スカル乳首金閣, Sukaru Chikubi Kinkaku) which comes from phonetic translations for his dialogs in Wresling series videos and is given by the fanatics of this series. However, his dance hadn't caught attention by itself in the beginning. The trigger video putting him in the spotlight was tracing his dance by hand-drawn animation with a solemn music, which was uploaded to NND on March 9th, 2010 (shown below, right). The girl starring in this video was Remilia Scarlet from Touhou Project series. The single topic Tumblr blog Facemath[1] was launched on June 10th, 2010, with its first post featuring an equation combining actor Val Kilmer and the puppet ALF to become the Spanish soccer player Sergio Ramos.  Because of many funny phonetic translated dialogues with Billy Herrington in the 1st video in wrestling series[2], Danny Lee a.k.a Kazuya Kiyoshi is one of the most popular sub-characters in this series. As a proof of this, many MAD videos featuring him have been posted on NND[3] and he has many fan illustrations on pixiv.[4] In addition to this, his solo performance video including the audio track which is nicknamed "Super Kazuya Theme" by NND users has been also watched hundreds of thousands of times on NND.[5][6] That video was first uploaded to NND on October 11th, 2008. The music remix movement was suddenly begun by 3 videos uploaded by each different NND users on June 14th, 2009. Those are "Super Kazuya Theme (Ver. Purple)",[7] "Super Kazuya Theme (Ver. Blue)"[8] and "Super Kazuya Theme (Ver. Pink)".[9] The phrase was first uttered in the second episode of _Futurama_'s first season titled "The Series Has Landed"[1], which originally aired on April 4th, 1999. While on a trip to an amusement park on the moon, robotic anti-hero Bender is caught reaching through an arcade claw machine prize slot while trying to retrieve a set of lost keys and is ejected from the building. As he lands on the moon's surface, he exclaims "I am going to build my own theme park with blackjack and hookers!" After walking back to the group's spaceship, Bender sees the door close and thinks they are about to leave without him, causing him to utter the phrase again in reference to building his own lunar lander. The first person shooter shooter game Doom was released by the video game development company id Software on December 10th, 1993. In the game, the player assumes the role of a space marine on the planet Mars, who battles demons that have teleported on the planet's two moons. To enable god mode, players could input the characters "IDDQD", which would turn the avatar's eyes yellow and prevent any damage from being received.  Redditor runrunwootwoot submitted a post to the /r/politics[7] subreddit on October 7th, 2008, citing the U.S. Senator John McCain's scandalous quote “I hate the gooks. I will hate them as long as I live” from 2000. In the comments, Redditor rgladstein recounted a story about confronting a coworker’s racist language, to which an unknown Redditor replied “You are so brave for standing up to racial injustice.”  The original instance of Birthday Scenario Game was posted via webcomic blog Chibird[1] by Jacqueline on June 14th, 2011. The list consisted of various phrases and pop culture references paired with 12 months and 31 days of the calendar year, with each month representing an action and each date representing a well-known fictional or non-fictional character. According to the description, Jacqueline came up with the game based on an elementary school game she was introduced through a friend. The DHMO hoax was first distributed via leaflets in the early 1990s by students at University of California Santa Cruz. They chose to use the term "dihydrogen monoxide," the molecular structure of water containing two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, because of the negative connotations of the term "monoxide," which is a common name for lethal carbon monoxide gas.[2] In 1994, one of the UC Santa Cruz students Craig Jackson launched a fictitious online organization known as Coalition to Ban Dihydrogen Monoxide for dissemination in newsgroups. The mock organization produced the following informational blurb about the dangers of DHMO, all of which are true, but were commonly misinterpreted given the scientific opaqueness of the term "dihydrogen monoxide": Despite the danger, dihydrogen monoxide is often used: The first video, Super Mario Långben Becomes Even Uglier, was made in 2000 along with the first Mongo video Mongo is Lazy.

The phrase originated from a series of Cinnamon Toast Crunch commercials aired during the 1990s, which featured children asking adults to explain why children enjoy the taste of the cereal (shown below). On April 19th, 2005, the Comic Book Resources Forums[5] member BitVyper started a thread titled "Can they see why kids love Cinnamon Toast Crunch?", which encouraged users to explain how various comic book superheros would discover why kids love the breakfast cereal.   The "Oh Stop It You" character was created by William and posted to his art blog GODBEAMS[1] on December 23rd, 2010. The Tumblr post has accrued 2757 notes as of July 2012. The idea was conceived in 1935 by Schrödinger during a correspondence[1] with Albert Einstein regarding the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, which posits that two quantum entangled particles are in an indefinite state until measured, in other words, we can only ascertain the probabilities of measuring entities which are nor particles or waves by classic definitions. To illustrate his issue with this notion, he devised a thought experiment in which a cat is placed in a steel container along with a Geiger counter, a tiny amount of a radioactive substance and a flask of hydrocyanic acid that would shatter if one atom of the radioactive substance decays. Based on the Copenhagen interpretation, the cat inside the box would be both dead and alive until someone lifted the lid of the box. One of the earliest online discussions began among university students and academics on Usenet's sci.physics[13] group on May 7th, 1990. In the thread, people discussed whether Schrodingers Cat applied to macroscopic environments and received over 22 replies by 13 authors.  In approximately late 2009, a video was posted to youtube titled "Me Playing Piano" It featured a young boy, roughly fifteen to eighteen in age, sit down on a piano bench and announced: "Good morning youtubers, today I will be playing to you a little rendition of my own" He then proceeded to turn to the piano, lean forward in an awkward and improper position, and started to randomly hit the keys of the piano. After almost a minute of constant hitting and banging, he then turned to the camera, and briefly said "Thank you." The original uploader goes by the username DannyTanner, and has a playlist of several gathered parodies of his video. The first parody was made by Youtube user "Rnwofccg" who swapped out a few of the scenes to make the playing more smoothly, and added a different audio track. Other users who had made parodies of it were: cooldudeguy6 Saiko69 thebigbat69 LilJanksta This was the second video uploaded by the original youtuber to upload it. No evidence of the original movie is found, but some viewers have vouched that it existed. The face belongs to the brony music artist The Living Tombstone. The original picture was taken at Bronycon 2012 in New York. It was first posted online on Tumblr on July 6th, 2012, on the blog of Laser Pon3, a laser projector artist that is a close friend to the musicain. One of the first online forum discussions about the phenomenon was started on the Steady Health Forums[3] by member okaywhatever on October 19th, 2007. In the thread titled “Weird Sensation Feels Good”, the original poster (OP) described a strange itchy sensation triggered by several different social interactions. On June 4th, 2008, SteadyHealth member tingler replied to the thread, who referred to the phenomenon as “Attention Induced Head Orgasm” (AIHO) and claimed to have experienced it for as long as he could remember. That same year, the now-defunct web forum AIHO.org was launched for people to discuss the strange sensations.[1] On December 12th, 2008, the Yahoo group “Society of Sensationalists”[4] was launched with a similar purpose, gaining over 3,200 members in less than three years. In February of 2010, Jennifer Allen coined the term “Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response” when she started a Facebook[5] group dedicated to the sensation.  On May 27th, 2011, one of the earliest known comments on record to take a critical tone against "ironic shitposting" was posted on /jp/ (Otaku culture) board[2] in response to a poorly written fanfiction involving the popular Japanese cosplay model Lenfried.    The earliest known use of the term "attention whore" can be found on Everything2 Wiki in a discussion thread about the axiom "It's better to be hated than to be ignored"[1] posted on May 19th, 2000. After a forum member named rue asked what other users thought of the phrase, a user named moJoe claimed he had been called an "attention whore" on the site previously, but would prefer to have his posts ignored than misunderstood. He then went on to prove that he was not an attention whore by providing a story of how he blew off a girl who had attempted to talk to him.    The initial scene itself comes from a porn movie entitled Young and Anal 15 released in 1999 and featured actors Anne Howe (Melissa Ashley) and Buck Adams. The segment reused in the meme refers to the following dialogue between the two: A censored version of the scene first found itself on YTMND. According to the YTMND wiki[1], the initial site that started the fad is "But I poop from there!" made by YTMND user BTape[2] on January 7th 2007 and which attracted over 428 000 views as of July 2012. However, it's marked as a "restored" version of the site, meaning that an older version may have existed prior. This is confirmed by several parodies of the site existing from 2004 to 2006, like the Superman one[3], dating back to March 28th 2006 and gaining more than 73 000 views to date. A fad then took hold on YTMND, curating over 90 sites.[4] Boswell uploaded his first music video remix to YouTube on September 7th, 2009, which featured infomercial footage of the television personality and pitchman Billy Mays (shown below, left). On September 17th, Boswell uploaded a video titled "Carl Sagan – 'A Glorious Dawn' ft Stephen Hawking (Symphony of Science)", including clips from Carl Sagan's 1980s television series Cosmos: A Personal Voyage and the documentary film Stephen Hawking's Universe (shown below, right). Within three years, the video received over 7.6 million views and 27,000 comments, as well as being ranked as one of the top rated videos of all time in the music category on YouTube.  The Tumblr blog “Did You Know?”[1] was launched on April 30th, 2011 with a post titled "10 Facts About You" directly addressing the reader.[2] The blog wasn't updated again until May 19th with a post stating that if the reader reblogged the image and clicked on it, the social networking site MySpace would appear differently than before. The blog began posting daily images on May 21st. Mario's Castle Calamity was a flash video created by NewGrounds User "Bigfoot3290" AKA Jeremy Simms and uploaded on NewGrounds.com on January 3, 2009. The video is based on the game "Super Mario World", where in game, after defeating the boss, Mario then demolishes the castle. Since it was uploaded, has gathered over 1.4 million views and has accrued an average rating of 4.42 of 5 stars from over 43000 votes. Simms then created and uploaded a sequel to the series on June 12, 2010. Though it didn't garner as many views as the predecessor, it was still popular, receiving an average rating of 4.4 of 5 stars by over 16000 votes. Around the beginning of 2003, Futaba was still just an online forum for some Otaku people. There wasn't creative momentum though people were talking aggressively all over the night on the boards. According to the article for Futaba in Wikipedia[1], this situation began changing in the end of that January by an old men's picture posted to a thread in /b/ board by an anonymous user. The old man with gentle looks and a strange costume said to other anonymous users who were engaging in a heated discussion in the midnight: "Gentlemen, Go sleeping" (お前ら、もう寝なさい, Omaera, Mou Nenasai)   The two footages at the beginning and at the end of such videos come from Valve's latest video upload on YouTube. The video is called "Meet the Pyro" and was released on June 27, 2012. In this video it's about finding out, what inhuman thoughts lie in Pyro's mind. But after zooming in in Pyro's mind, it shows joy and happiness. While the reaction images are rumored to have originated from the image board 4chan, the earliest documented use of the expression online can be found in the title of a photograph depicting statues of St. John Chrysostom and St. Gregory, uploaded by Flickr[4] user Dan Price on October 26, 2010 (shown below).   The earliest known usage of the story appeared on 4chan on June 19th, 2012 (shown below). This happy hardcore track "Sakura Reflection" was writen by a Japanese composer Ryu☆[2] who has also produced other popular audio tracks for online parody videos: "Second Heaven", "Ageha", "I'm so happy" and "Bloomin' Feeling". It was first included as a secret track in REFLEC BEAT which was released on the Japanese arcade in November 4th, 2010. The earliest instance reusing this song in MADs was uploaded to NND on January 10th, 2011[3], which featured a Japanese funny dancing TVCM meme Ippon Manzoku Bar. But this couldn't become the trigger of this fad. In the 2003 Disney-Pixar animated film Finding Nemo, Marlin and Dory, the protagonist characters in frantic search of the former's son Nemo, get scooped up by a brown pelican named Gerald upon their arrival at the Sydney Harbor. As Marlin and Dory are about to get swallowed by Gerald on a nearby dock, Nigel, another pelican who has been acquainted with Nemo, shows up and tries to explain to them that he is alive and well. However, both fish attempt to flee the dock in fear of getting eaten by the pelicans, only to find themselves completely surrounded by a flock of seagulls a moment later. Upon seeing Marlin and Dory in their helpless state, one of the seagulls utter "MINE" in trying to claim his newly found prey, which prompts the rest of the flock to yell "MINE" and chase after the fish in absolute chaos. The earliest known usage of the scene as a reaction image can be traced back to a /r/funny post titled "Skrillex Fans," submitted by Redditor Simon_Killface on January 12th, 2012, which garnered more than 1,110 points (89% upvoted) prior to its archival.  Passion Yara started his career as a standup comedian in 2004, and his major routine is role-playing a typical host in children television programs with angry face and passionate chest-beating. And because comedy-related TV programs were very trending in Japanese broadcasting stations in mid-2000s, Passion Yara had appeared on many of them with the tide. His videos reprinted to YouTube or NND are mainly taken from those TV programs aired around 2005-2007. On October 4th, 2008, the sketch comedy television show Saturday Night Live parodied the 1970s televised variety show The Lawrence Welk Show, in which actress Kristen Wiig played a physically deformed member of a sister act with tiny doll-sized hands. The "One Tiny Hand" Tumblr[1] blog was launched on March 11th, 2012, with its first post featuring an edited photo of singer-songwriter Beyoncé Knowles cradling her pregnant stomach with one hand photoshopped to appear smaller than the other.    The Kitten Covers[1] was created by musician and designer Alfra Martini[2] while home sick from her day job in October 2011. While sifting through online record catalogs, she pictured British musician David Bowie as a kitten. She chose the cover from his 1973 album Aladdin Sane, replacing Bowie's face with a white kitten wearing similar makeup. Her boyfriend liked the images so much, he suggested she make more and start a Tumblr blog to showcase them.    Brand Spirit[1] was created by New York based branding and design strategist Andrew Miller[2] in March 2012. His goal was "to reduce the object to its purest form" by removing all labels and markings from the item. The first post was made on March 13th, showing a Heinz ketchup packet. The remix version of the theme song "fine c'est la mix" is composed by a Japanese famous music producer Yasutaka Nakata.[2] The first instance of this series was uploaded to Nico Nico Douga (NND) on April 8th, 2008, titled "Kamo-Pittan".[3] The guy performing typical dance step of Japanese idols is Kamotaro Ito from a Japanes anime/manga series Gintama.[4] According to an article for this series in Nico Nico Pedia[5], this dance step is inspired by a Japanese idol Aya Matsuura.[6] The animated parody series first kicked-off by an animated fan-video created by Niconico user Gagame (ががめ) and uploaded to the site on August 31st, 2010 in celebration of the three year anniversary of the release of the Hatsune Miku Vocaloid software. The animation features Miku rolling down a hill and performing dramatic flips and acrobatic moves while set to a cover version of her song "Rolling Girl", performed by Niconico singer Korosuke[2] (転少女) (shown below, left). The animation was later re-uploaded the next day with revisions being made in the video and audio swapped with the original "Rolling Girl" song (shown below, right). The quote “You keep using that word, I do not think it means what you think it means” was said by American actor Mandy Patinkin[2] who portrayed the swordsman Inigo Montoya[3] in the 1987 romantic comedy The Princess Bride.[1] Throughout the movie, Sicilian boss Vizzini (portrayed by Wallace Shawn[4]) repeatedly describes the unfolding events as “inconceivable.” After Vizzini attempts to cut a rope the Dread Pirate Roberts is climbing up, he yells out that it was inconceivable that the pirate did not fall. To this, Montoya replied with the quote: The clip of the scene from Princess Bride was uploaded via YouTube channel Bagheadclips on February 4th, 2007. Since its upload, the video has been used in the comments of Reddit posts as early as since January 2008[20] and has gained more than 644,000 views as of July 2012. The Tumblr blog “Girls That Look Like Skrillex”[1] was launched on April 2nd, 2011, with the first post calling for viewers to submit photos of women with Skrillex' hair style. The same day, four photos were published of women with one side of their head shaved.  The original baby photograph (shown below, left) was submitted to the /r/funny[7] subreddit by user MaryjaneBrewington in a post titled "She tells the worst jokes" on June 25th, 2012. The same day, the first Drunk Baby image macro was submitted by Redditor snicklefritz618 to the /r/AdviceAnimals[1] subreddit, which included the caption "This guy…. / I love this guy" (shown below, right). Within 10 days, the post received over 6,600 up votes and 100 comments. Mineturtle was first introduced within asdfmovie 5 which was released in 2012 and had a quick scene where he was introduced, it replied with "Hello", then accidently stepped on and exploded. The blog[1] was started on February 28th, 2012 by Josh Kimball[2], an executive editor of a consumer trend reporting firm in Saint Paul, Minnesota. Three images were shared on the first day, featuring screenshots from the iPhone Game Center (below left), Facebook (below right) and music player Spotify. Kumamon was designed by the Kumamoto government and unveiled to the public on March 12th, 2010 in an effort to promote tourism in the region. As part of the campaign, the local government launched a personal website,[2] blog,[3] as well as Facebook[4] and Twitter[5] accounts for the mascot, whose official description says he is a public employee in the prefecture.         The line originates from the 1980 film Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back, released on May 21st, 1980, and was spoken by Darth Vader after Lando Calrissian expresses his dissatisfaction at Vader's broken promises (seen below). The original line is "I am altering the deal, pray I don't alter it any further."

Researching.     On April 9th, 2005, Wikipedia editor Deceased submitted an article titled "Wikirace" to the site, which provided a brief description of the gameplay and the rules. Some of the main rules included requiring attendance of all players in the same room, prohibiting the use of hub articles such as disambiguation pages from the game, as well as the use of search function or "find" command to isolate relevant links. First select a page off the top of your head. Using "Random page" works well, as well as the featured article of the day. This will be your beginning page. Next chose a destination page. Generally, this destination page is something very unrelated to the beginning page. … Once you have selected a beginning page and an destination page, the race begins and the first person to reach the destination page wins. According to the page, the game was originally conceived by an unlisted group of high school students in 2005.   The first Porn Movie entry was published in 4chan on the 19th of June, 2012.

Various maternal insults[1] have been recorded throughout history. According to the Discover Magazine blog,[2] the earliest known example was written on a tablet by a Babylonian student in 1,500 BCE. On the tablet, an incomplete riddle about a mother was discovered, translating as "of your mother is by the one who has intercourse with her. What/who is it?" In 2 Kings 9:22 in the Hebrew Bible, with the earliest texts found in the 9th century CE, the rebel Jehu greets King Joram by insulting his mother. In the play Timon on Athens, written by William Shakespeare in the early 1600s, the character Apemantus replies to an insult from a painter by comparing his mother to a dog:    "Object to Your Left" threads have appeared on Yahoo! Answers[13] since as early as May 18th, 2009, when Mayhem asked users to fill in the blank of the quote “The people have a right to the truth as they have a right to life, liberty and the pursuit of ______” with the item found on their left. One of the most popular renditions of the game suggest that the object found will be your weapon in a zombie apocalypse. It is often found in a shareable image with a hand pointing left. One of the earliest instances of that image was posted to the blog Design Crush[1] on August 9th, 2010. The Tumblr blog Ca$hcats[1] was created by New York City-based writer Will Zweigart and launched on January 11th, 2011 under the domain name cashcats.biz.

Need Help     The name stems from the popular tech news site Slashdot, where featured links would often become unavailable as a result of its readers suddenly flooding into an unsuspecting website with smaller bandwidth capacity. The site that became inaccessible as a result of referral traffic from Slashdot is said to have been "Slashdotted" or "/." The term was first coined on the site sometime in the second quarter of 1998 and the original definition was submitted to the Free Online Dictionary of Computing by Slashdot user John Abbot on October 24th, 1998. Less than a month later in November, Abbot posted a link to the dictionary entry on Slashdot, which remains the earliest known mention of the term on the site. (Jargon) An effect where a document on a WWW server is linked to from another, popular, site, with the resultant traffic overloading the server so that a connection cannot be made to it. This is especially likely if the server is running Microsoft IIS. The name stems from a discussion thread posted on the RPG.net forums in October 2005, when one of the members named Danth[2] got into an argument with another poster, Spiderman1fan.[3] As other users began attacking the holes in Danth’s logic, he replied by saying that since people were resorting to mean-spirited comments about him, he took it as a sign that he has won the argument.[4] This observation was coined as “Danth’s Law” two years later with its inclusion in the Rational Wiki[1] in May 2007.  On September 22nd, 2011, Facebook unveiled a new profile lay out called "Timeline"[1] during its annual F8 developers conference held in San Francisco, California. The new layout allowed users to add posts to a specified time period and embed a wide cover image (851px × 315px) behind the traditional profile photo (200px x 200px).

The copypasta is believed to have originated on the military and weapons enthusiast image board Operator Chan sometime in 2010. The earliest archived posting was submitted on November 11th, 2010 to 4chan's /jp/[4] (Otaku Culture) board, in which the poster claimed to have seen the message previously on Operator Chan. On May 24th, 2012, an anonymous user submitted a thread to the /pasta/[1] board, claiming he had created the original copypasta two to three years prior (shown below).

The first[19] was uploaded that January and intended as a guide for lay population to be able to identify an email virus hoax. The second was a scientific research paper titled “Hoaxes and Hypes”[18] presented later that year at the 7th Virus Bulletin International Conference held in San Francisco, California. On March 19th, 2004, the webcomic site Penny Arcade published a comic titled "Green Blackboards (And Other Anomalies)," which featured a drawing of a green blackboard with the equation “Normal Person + Anonymity + Audience = Total Fuckwad” in reference to behavior seen in the 2004 first-person shooter Unreal Tournament. The video was first seen in the Televisa Guadalajara news in its section "El show de la Barandilla" a Cops-esque show about oft-comical police interventions against drunkards.    The axiom was coined by American actor and writer Richard William Wheaton III (Star Trek: TNG) during his keynote speech at the Penny Arcade Expo (PAX) in August 2007. One of the core messages of Wheaton's speech was the importance of sportsmanship in online gaming, which eventually became encapsulated in the phrase "Don't be a dick." While the actor's PAX speech is attributed as the original iteration of the law, the colloquial phrase "Don't be a dick" had been in widespread use prior to the event, since as early as 1999.[17] The keynote speech and his proposition were met by positive reception from the audience and the webcast viewers at home, as well as significant coverage from a number of well-known geek culture blogs like Ars Technica, 1UP, and Joystiq. The axiom was once again highlighted in Wheaton's blog post[1] about his PAX experience published on August 22nd: . . . or something. I'm working on it.

The myth of Nintendium originated in 2005 with Nintendo's acquisition of a Game Boy machine that was recovered from a bombarded barrack during the Gulf War. Although its plastic body was heavily damaged, the hardware seemed to be perfectly functional when it was placed on permanent display with the classic puzzle game Tetris at the Nintendo Center located in New York City. On October 3rd, 2006, YouTuber PlaidNinja uploaded a video clip of the Game Boy on display. As of June 2012, the video has generated more than 598,000 views and 2,000 comments. While it is unclear who coined the term "Nintendium" or where the myth began, but its earliest known mention can be found in a console-related discussion thread posted via PurePwnage[4] forum on October 1st, 2006.

The background image was taken by CMGW Photography[1] on May 8th, 2012 at Sea World in Florida. Weeks later on May 24th, the photo was uploaded via Flickr[2] with the title “First Contact." From there, the image was featured on BoingBoing[3], the Wall Street Journal[4] and culture blog DeadFix[5] before it was posted to Reddit[6] on May 25th, 2012. The first Reddit submission only received 90 points, but a second post[7] submitted 25 minutes later reached the front page with 5412 up votes and 1505 points overall. Later that day, a captioned version was submitted to the Advice Animals subreddit[8] naming the series "Overlord Manatee." The post received 12,385 upvotes and 1488 points overall.

YouTube user Dr. Face (69Starmix96) cemented the fad a month later with "Scout is Hungry", featuring Team Fortress 2's Scout, whose head was placed over Pumkin's and whose dialogue was edited to resemble Pumkin's. As of April 2013, this video has 1,324,119 views and a multitude of fad responses featuring other characters standing in Pumkin's place. In the episode "Excaliferb"[6] which aired on January 15th, 2012 in Disney Channel, there is a scene where the main protagonist Phineas was talking about the unearthly realm. As the scene plays out, an animation error occurred when Phineas blinked which causes his eyes to disappear.  On April 1st, 2010, the earliest known instance was posted to the /m/ (Mecha) board on the imageboard 4chan,[2] featuring the face of the character Siegfried Kircheis from Legend of the Galactic Heroes[1] (shown below).   The original image comes from a stock photograph titled "Sad Man And Rain" (shown below, left), which is available for download on the royalty free stock photo website Public Domain Pictures.[1] On June 4th, 2012, Redditor RPShep submitted a post titled "Over-Educated Problems"[2], which featured the stock image captioned with "Don't know whether to use correct pronunciation / or common pronunciation" (shown below, right). Within three days, the post received over 16,800 upvotes and 1,650 comments. On June 6th, 2012, YouTuber wzr0713 uploaded a webcam video titled "JB Fanvideo"[1] in which she performs a parody rendition of Justin Bieber's latest single "Boyfriend" with personalized lyrics. According to Gawker's article[2], the video was submitted in response to Bieber's announcement of an online sing-off contest[3] in promoting his celebrity perfume "Girlfriend." If I was your girlfriend / I’d never let you leave / without a small recording device / taped under your sleeve I’ll always be checking up on you / Hey, boy, who you talking to? / Spend a day with your girl, I’ll be calling you my husband.” YouTuber wzr0713's parody song, marked by its clingly, stalker-like lyrics, instantly drew attention from the viewers on YouTube and Reddit, many of whom wondered about the girl's true intention behind making the video. In less than 48 hours of upload, the video received more than 1.35 million views. The idea of Pinkie Pie being able to break the 4th wall is taken directly from the show itself. Although most characters' abilities in the during the episodes are limited to what should be physically possible in show[3], Pinkie Pie, who is already known for her random nature, has had several instances where she shows awareness to the cinematic and cartoon elements of the show. Reacting to fade-outs and iris-wipes, and often looking directly at the audience. Other ponies do this as well, but more for the convenience of breaking out into song. Unlike Pinkie Pie who does it at a normal, non-spectacular, basis.  On June 5th, 2012, Nintendo held a press conference[8] at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), officially unveiling the Wii U's tablet controller GamePad and launch titles including the New Super Mario Bros and Nintendo Land, a theme-park party game made of 12 minigames based on multiple franchise characters. The conference event was immediately followed by Nintendo's preview reel of upcoming releases, which opened with a gag clip of Nintendo CEO Satoru Iwata staring at a bunch of bananas in silence. The origins of this meme dates back to a thread posted in /b/ on June 4, 2012, in which the original poster asked: "Best caption for this pic? Do your worst." While the origins of this image aren't completely clear, based upon thread comments, the original image was taken from a Facebook profile (source needed).  The first instance of this series was a hand-drawn animated video uploaded to NND on July 30th, 2011 by a user roah.[1] In this video, he made Utsuho Reiuji, a big breast girl in Touhou Project, bounce her breast with her symbolic warning line "Caution!!" and the main theme song of Spelunker. The original post of this 20-second video on NND is played endlessly by auto loop feature in NND video player and had been watched over 200,000 times within its first year. And, roah left a short comment in a description of the original post with a touch of self-derision "What the Hell Am I Doing…". On March 24th, 2012, YouTuber[1] mans1ay3r uploaded the first video in his Gamer Poop series (a version of YouTube Poops based on video games) based on Mass Effect 3. In the video, a male Commander Shepard is approached for an interview, gets distracted by the reporter's breasts, and then ends the conversation by saying, "we'll bang, ok?" The original video has since gone private, but the scene was re-uploaded as an isolated clip by mans1ay3r in 2017, garnering over 300,000 views in three years (shown below). The video was shared by anonymous users on 4chan's /v/[2][3] board and other social media platforms a number of times over the next few days, helping it gain viral success, although the exact view count before being removed is unknown.  On November 26th, 2009, YouTuber RealPapaPit uploaded a video clip titled "I am very glad, because I'm finally back home." The performer singing in the video was identified as Eduard Anatolyevich Khil, a Soviet-era vocalist once celebrated as the "Honored Artist of the USSR" in 1968 and "People's Artist of the USSR" in 1974. The song is an example of the Vokaliz tradition, a style of singing similar to the pantomime and American scat singing of the 1920s. The video was later renamed "Mr. Trololo original upload" and received over 26 million views and 48,500 comments over the next eight years.   On May 21st, 1980, the first sequel to Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back was released in theaters. In the film, the character Luke Skywalker travels to Degobah to seek Yoda (portrayed by Mark Hamill and Frank Oz), a Jedi master.      On February 10th, 2009, as a part of an advert campaign for a new video game for PlayStation Potable THE iDOLM@STER SP[2], Sony Computer Entertainment Japan announced about the release of the special items of THE iDOLM@STER on PlayStation Home from the 12th of that month.[3] It made fans so excited, and they were agog over the items because THE iDOLM@STER series hadn't be released for PS3 console yet in those days and it was the first appearance of the game series on that console. However, screenshots in the announcement disappointed devotees so much. In there, an expressionless Haruka Amami with a strange body shape was just standing creepy. The special items were Haruka Amami's face mask and her costumes for avatars. Developers explained that this cheapness was a homage to plastic masks which are sold on street stalls at Japanese festivals.[4]  A Lyra plushie[1] doll was placed for sale on the online auction site The Dealers Den by DeviantArt user Hoppip[2] on May 27th, 2012 (shown below). The stuffed toy came with removable clothing and "a special hole in her butt that you can stick your penis in," according to the seller's description. The product page included tips on how to clean the toy and an option to purchase a slightly different model without the hole. The auction was closed on June 3rd with 134 bids present and was sold for £460 GBP or $704 USD. The plushie was received a few weeks later on June 20th, 2012, by twentypercentcooler.net[34] user Rainbow Slash[15], with its signature hole still present.[16] The Demoman was introduced for the video game Team Fortress 2 within the year 2007. He is known as a defence class known for his use of gernades and swords within gameplay. Along the sound files that was used for this, a quote within had sated the word we hear today as 'SEE'        The name "Mary Sue" is taken from a character[10] that appeared in Paula Smith's[18] parody Star Trek fanfiction titled "A Trekkie's Tale."[12] Originally published in the December 1973 issue of the fanzine The Menagerie[16], the 200 word piece intended to critique the abundance of Star Trek fanfiction Smith saw in which adolescent girls become the youngest member of the Starfleet crew whom every canon character fell in love with.[17] It was paired with a drawing of wide-eyed young girl with braces to illustrate what the character would have looked like.  While the message began to appear widely around March 2012, it seems to date back from significantly earlier, as an instance from in or around July 2011 has been found on blindloop.com. [1] Though the term was not coined until 2000 by the editors of the fiction-hosting site Englishchick[20], critique of poorly written fanfiction has been around just as long as fanfiction[10] itself. As early as 1973, tropes that were considered low quality by the majority of other writers in the fandom were critiqued in fan zines. That same year, the Star Trek fanzine The Menagerie published a story titled “A Trekkie’s Tale” to satirize the frequent appearance of overly idealized original characters in fanfiction stories, as encapsulated in the female protagonist character Mary Sue. Badfics are often characterized by their poor grammar, absence of a plot and vague sex scenes. The authors of these stories tend to put sincere efforts in the writing process and unintentionally gain notoriety as a result of various shortcomings and lack of experience. Instead of the serious response the author was hoping to elicit, many of these types of stories yield an ironic "so bad it's good" type of appreciation.  This TVCM for Pizza Hut's new menu "Mini Dog" was aired for a certain period from March, 2010. It was starring a Japanese comedian Hidehiko Ishizuka famous for a big eater, and featured his impressive smile (shown below, left). The first video remix was created by a Japanese famous MAD/YTPMV creator yamas03, and his remix has been uploaded to YouTube and NND on November 25th and 28th of 2010.[1][2] The musical resource for the video is "Paradox" from the NES version of Arkanoid[3], and the lady in a portrait shown for only a moment in this video is a Japanese voice actor Nobuyo Ōyama[4] who's famous for a hardcore gamer of this game. The time cards originate from the Nickelodeon animated TV series SpongeBob SquarePants. The first episode of the series to feature a time card was "I Was a Teenage Gary", which originally aired on October 28, 1999. It featured the card "Three Days Later".[1] Since the episode's airing, over 60 different cards have been used throughout the series.[2] The phrase was first uttered in the 1984 comedy film Ghostbusters by Dana Barrett (played by Sigourney Weaver) who hires the team to remove a ghost from her New York City apartment. Later in the investigation, Ghostbuster Peter Venkman (played by Bill Murray) finds Barrett possessed by the spirit of the demonic demigod Zuul, at which point Barrett says the line: Peter Venkman: Dana? It's Peter. Dana Barrett: There is no Dana, there is only Zuul. Peter Venkman: Ol' Zuula you nut, now c'mon. C'mon. I want to talk to Dana. Dana. Just relax, c'mon. Dana. Dana. Can I talk to Dana? Dana Barrett: [deep demonic voice] There is no Dana, only Zuul. Peter Venkman: What a lovely singing voice you must have. The earliest known use of the phrase appeared on the programming language message board PerlMonks[5] in December 2000, when the forum user amelinda referenced the quote to express his or her distaste for the commercialization of Christmas.  The song was composed and produced in August 1992 by English demoscene artist Mark Knight[1] on the Commodore Amiga personal computer with the freeware tracker program Protracker. As a game musician, Knight worked for PC game developers like 3D Realms and Electronic Arts and wrote original compositions for many console formats from the Nintendo Entertainment System through to the PlayStation and PC. Knight left the demo music scene shortly afterwards in 1993 to pursue his career in video game composition, but the song was rediscovered many years later by YTPMV artist DWL1993, who paired Knight's original chiptune song with Team Fortress 2 video footage and uploaded it onto YouTube on October 20th, 2010. The quote comes from the title sequence of the television series Avatar: The Last Airbender, which Nickelodeon first aired on February 21st, 2005. In the sequence, the main protagonist Katara narrates the line while recalling the Fire Nation invasion. On May 21st, 2012, a post was published on the Cheezburger site Memebase[1] titled "The Last Dovahkin", which featured a two pane comic with a guard from the role-playing game The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim followed by a screenshot of the invading Fire Nation with the caption "I used to be an adventurer like you / But everything changed… …when the Fire Nation attacked." The melody of Love Colored Master Spark comes from a song in the second installment of the Touhou series, Love Colored Magic, which also notably marked the introduction of Marisa Kirisame. Several games later the song underwent a remix and a name change. The remix originates from the 8th installment of the Touhou Project Series, Imperishable Night.[1] Marisa can appear in the fourth stage as a boss if the player chooses either the Illusionary Border Team (幻想の結界チーム) or the Netherworld Dwellers' Team (幽冥の住人チーム) at the beginning of the game, otherwise the player ends up with Reimu Hakurei as the boss.  According to the rumor database Snopes[2], the earliest mention of Jenkem comes from an article titled “Zambia-Narcotics: ‘Huffing and Puffing’ to New High” published by the Inter Press Service[1] on August 26th, 1995. The article reported that street children in Zambia had been using fermented human excrement scooped out of sewer ponds to get high. On September 18th, 1998, The New York Times[8] published an article titled “In Zambia, the Abandoned Generation” citing workers at the nonprofit organization Fountain of Hope who claimed that street children were using jenkem to get high in Zambia’s capital city Lusaka. On July 30th, 1999, BBC[10] published an article titled “Africa Children High on Sewage" which described the jenkem manufacturing process. On March 8th, 2002, UNICEF[9] released a report titled “Rapid Assessment of Street Children in Lusaka" which listed jenkem as a popular drug among Lusaka street children. On October 25th, 2005, the first Urban Dictionary[7] entry for "jenkem" was submitted by user Kazhakkey Szervusz-Thackur, defining the substance as a "mixture of ripened sewage" used in third-world countries as a substitute for huffing glue.   Sweetie Belle Stare started with a video uploaded by youtube user "Zejoph" named "Sweetie Belle stares into your soul" in which Sweetie Belle of the CMC stares blankly at the camera. In the background, the CMC's theme plays as the camera slowly zooms in on her face. Shortly thereafter, an emoticon on the subreddit /r/mylittlepony was added, called "sbstare". The novelty account "SweetieRolld" was created named that tricked users into clicking on the video. This video spawned a variety of different spin-off videos, as well as an entire collection of recolors.  The first example of a YTPMV is YTPMV: You Are An Egghead, uploaded on October 21st, 2007, by YouTube user Vorhias. The video included clips from the Super Mario World TV show matched up to an original composition. The video has since gained over 100,000 views in under 9 years.  In year 1994, Mahir Bureković released the song called Mudžahedin (meaning Mujaheedin in Bosnian language) for propaganda during the Bosnian war. On 9th September 2013, Youtube user AMAR-UTU uploaded a video titled "DEFEND KEBAB THEME SONG", which consisted of the instrumental version of Bureković's Mujahideen song. Ever since then, it gained over 100.000 vies. The Circus[1] is a silent film written and directed by British actor and filmmaker Charlie Chaplin.[8] Originally released in 1928, the plot revolves around a circus ringmaster who hires Chaplin's Little Tramp as a clown, only to discover that he can make people laugh unintentionally. The Circus premiered at Mann's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, California and was re-released in DVD format in 2004. The woman in the background of the Hollywood premiere went seemingly unnoticed until October 19th, 2010, when Irish filmmaker George Clarke uploaded a vlog post to his YouTube channel[2] arguing that this woman was a time traveler who was holding up a cellphone to her ear. As of May 2012, this video has more than 6.2 million views. Fancy Crab's origin likely traces to quickmeme.com[1], in which the first image of Fancy Crab was posted on October 19th, 2011.[2]  According to the keyboardist, Slobodan Vrga, the video was filmed near Knin, Croatia, in 1995 apparently by an independent producer named Nikola Jorgic. The singer, Zeljko Grmusa, also identified the site as near Knin but the year as 1993. Jorgic is featured briefly speaking into a microphone at the beginning of the earliest online instance of the music video uploaded by YouTuber ARHIVISTA on August 3rd, 2008. ARHIVISTA is the account of Croatian documentary filmmaker Pavle Vranjican who covered the Yugoslav Wars near Knin. Due to inclusion of scenes from Karadžić's 2008 trial, the clip appears to have been modified from its original source to parody the creators' intent. Vrga initially identified Nenad Tintor as the trumpeter and Grmusa as the vocalist but did not recall the name of the accordionist. Vrga later acknowledged Novislav Đajić as the accordionist. In light of the song being played prior to the Christchurch mosque shootings, both Vrga and Grmusa have condemned the shooter's actions. Tintor's life after the video remains unknown. Đajić was later indicted on 15 charges of genocide and sentenced to 5 years of imprisonment in Germany. After serving his term, he supposedly lived in Budva, Montenegro, until his apparent death in 2014, though neither the surviving members of the music video nor records have confirmed this information. Jorgic, the producer of the music video, was also indicted on charges of genocide and sentenced to life imprisonment in Germany. He died in prison in 2014 due to complications of heart disease and diabetes as confirmed by Serbian news media.     The original pigeon photograph comes from the photo blog AndysLens[13] (shown below, left). In August of 2010, a page for "Religion Pigeon" was created on the image macro website Meme Generator.[4] The first uploaded example included the caption "Drugs offer false hope and lies / turn to god instead" (shown below, right). Religion Pigeon can be seen as a companion meme to Advice God, another advice animal series satirizing Christian beliefs that emerged through Meme Generator around the same time.    The earliest viral instance including group choreography in the back seat of a moving vehicle can be attributed to a sing-along tribute video to Venga Boys’ “Boom Boom Boom” uploaded via YouTube on October 19th, 2006. The video has accumulated more than 18 million views as of May 2012. The face first appeared in a rage comic shared on the Spanish-language humor site Cuánto Cabrón[1] on February 11th, 2011. In the comic, a student is shown thinking “Math exam…I haven’t even studied…but they’re just numbers” followed by a panel of equations with letters. A trollface teacher appears in third panel saying “As you can see, the test is very simple for those who have studied.” The final panel shows the frustrated student admitting that the teacher has won this time and that he should have studied. The comic received a positive score of 3020 out of 5112 votes. Error 37 is a meme originating from Diablo III's release on 15 May 2012. The origin of the meme derives from an error message faced by most players when trying to login to the game. The error was caused by the overload of the battle.net login servers. The error message reads "The Servers are Busy at this time. Please try again later. (Error 37)", as shown in the image below: This error has caused misery to millions who have bought the game – because the login failure prevents the game from being played at all – not even for single player mode. The frustration of the Internet brought along the meme. In 2006, Littlekuriboh uploaded the 8th episode of YGOTAS (Yu-gi-Oh Abridged Series), where the quote was used for the first time. On January 21st, 2009, an animated music video titled “The Duck Song" by Bryant Oden was uploaded to the Songdrops[1] YouTube channel, which featured the song with the lyrics displayed in a sequence of slides. On March 23rd, YouTuber Forrest Whaley uploaded an animated music video for the song, which received over 88 million views within three years. On April 21st, the song was released for sale on the iTunes[2] music store for $.99. (Bum bum bum, ba-dum ba-dum) A duck walked up to a lemonade stand And he said to the man, running the stand "Hey! (Bum bum bum) Got any grapes?" The man said, "No we just sell lemonade. But it’s cold And it's fresh And it’s all home-made. Can I get you glass?" The duck said, “I’ll pass”. Then he waddled away. (Waddle waddle) 'Til the very next day. (Bum bum bum bum Bum ba-dum) When the duck walked up to the lemonade stand And he said to the man running the stand, "Hey! (Bum bum bum) Got any grapes? The man said, "No, like I said yesterday We just sell lemonade OK? Why not give it a try?" The duck said, "Goodbye." Then he waddled away. (Waddle waddle) Then he waddled away. (Waddle waddle waddle) Then he waddled away (Waddle waddle) 'Til the very next day. (Bum bum bum bum bum ba-dum) When the duck walked up to the lemonade stand And he said to the man running the stand, "Hey! (bum bum bum) Got any grapes? The man said, Look, this is getting old. I mean, lemonade’s all we’ve ever sold. Why not give it a go?" The duck said, “How 'bout, no.” Then he waddled away (Waddle waddle) Then he waddled away. (Waddle waddle waddle) Then he waddled away (Waddle waddle) 'Til the very next day.

And one more question for you; "Got any grapes?" (Bum bum bum, bum bum bum) And the man just stopped. Then he started to smile. He started to laugh. He laughed for a while. He said, “Come on duck, let’s walk to the store. I’ll buy you some grapes So you won’t have to ask anymore.” So they walked to the store And the man bought some grapes. He gave one to the duck and the duck said, “Hmm… No thanks. But you know what sounds good? It would make my day. Do you think this store… Do you think this store… Do you think this store…has any… lemonade?” (Fading) Then he waddled away. (Waddle waddle) Then he waddled away. (Waddle waddle waddle) Then he waddled away (Waddle waddle)     The origin of the original cow picture is currently unknown. On October 22nd, 2002, the photograph was posted to the social news site Fark[3] in reply to a news story about an employee who was fired for refusing to pray to Jesus (shown left). On May 13th, 2012, Redditor Drunkmonkey 35 posted an image macro of the photo to the /r/pics[2] subreddit with the caption "Moo, motherfucker / moo" (shown right). The song dates back to the 1820s (song below). Based on the earlier British traditional song "The (Old) Rose Tree," the song "was brought to America's colonies by Scots-Irish immigrants who settled along the Appalachian Trail and added lyrics that mirrored their new lifestyle."[5] The first "The World's Loneliest Whale" meme in it's most used (and current template) (made by Reddit user Mr_Cutestory) appeared approximately 9 hours after a TIL (Today I learned) post by Reddit user EscapetheMachine on 18/5/12. [2] The dance takes its name from the American rapper and beatboxer Doug E. Fresh[1], known for this signature move in the 1980s. It was initially popularized in 2007 by Dallas rapper Lil Wil with his hit rap single “My Dougie." In the official music video, Lil Wil and his dancers can be seen swaying back and forth while moving their hands over their heads.  The idea was conceived by Scottish artist Michael who noticed that players on the mobile app game Draw Something could easily cheat by spelling out the name of the object instead of drawing it. Michael began executing his idea by inserting Hitler into every Draw Something submission he worked on and on May 6th, 2012, he launched the Tumblr blog Ignore Hitler[1] to curate his artworks as well as his friends' contributions. "The game is Draw Something – you’re presented with an object to draw for your opponent to guess. I include gratuitous Hitlers in the drawing with no relevance to the actual answer and etch the phrase ‘IGNORE HITLER’ instructing my opponent to disregard the fuhrer’s presence." Spamming of irrelevant images in turn-based drawing games has been seen before on Doodle or Die.      The Tumblr blog What Should We Call Me[1] was started on February 6th, 2012 by two 24-year-old best friends who had recently parted ways to attend law schools in Washington, D.C. and San Francisco, California. While chatting online one night, the pair decided to start a collaborative blog to stay in touch with each other during the school year. While discussing their plan, the Californian friend accidentally typed “What should we call me?” in naming of the blog and they decided to go with the awkward phrase for the blog's name.[2] The first post paired a GIF animation from the Disney television show That’s So Raven[3] featuring the titular character’s little brother talking about putting on his “eating pants” with the post title “When my best friend and I decide we’re not going out.”  The man behind the photo is Zach Downey, a photographer who worked at the Lilly Library at Indiana University. According to a post on Reddit[18], Downey cut his hair into the mullet as a joke for his Halloween costume back in 2003. At the time, his wife, Tricia, snapped a quick shot of him the morning after Halloween and uploaded it online where it spread and became a meme. "Two of my friends were going out on Halloween as superheroes," Downey recalled. "They had special clothing, glitter on their faces, they went to a lot of trouble. I got some clippers and cut my hair in 10 minutes and I was the hit. The mullet is associated with rednecks or hillbillies for sure," he said. "I'm not like that, but I mean no disrespect. I have friends that I'd call and they'd call themselves rednecks or hillbillies. That's fine. It's just not me." According to the post, Downey had the haircut for just about 16 hours. His wife posed him in front of friend Jen Owen's 1979 GMC truck and took some photos the next day. Then they hauled out the clippers, cut the mullet into a mohawk, took more photos, shaved his head completely and snapped a few more. "Actually, and this was the plan all along, I donated my hair to Locks of Love. It's kind of funny that some young person out there actually benefited from my haircut," Downey said. "Mullets of Love?" Originally uploaded to a mullet photo gallery website by a friend, it was named "Mullet of the Month" on the site, and after that, it spread to other places online. The photo was then used as early as July 2005 as a response photo on the internet humor site Fark. On July 3rd, 2005, Fark user sens posted the image[9] in response to a story claiming Toyota would be building a plant in Canada because they did not want to train southern Americans. The photo was used on Fark in this manner on at least 2 other occasions in 2005[10] and 2009.[2] On May 12th, 2012, Redditor IanL27 submitted an image macro to the Advice Animals subreddit in a post titled "I present to you: Somewhat Politically Correct Redneck"[11], which featured the caption "Not against gay marriage / unless the couple is colored." Within three days the post received over 3,700 up votes, earning 1124 points overall.  The first video with the title "When You Give a Minotaur a Dollar" was inspired, created and uploaded on March 4, 2012 by YouTube user "LimeyLassen". LimeyLassen used the 19th episode of season 2 of the TV series "My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic" called "Putting Your Hoof Down", when Iron Will said to Fluttershy: You were nothing but a doormat and Iron Will turned you into a lean, mean, assertive machine. LimeyLassen was inspired to make his version by the video "Shuffling Iron Will", which is actually the first "Dancing Iron Will" video. The background song of LimeyLassen's video is called "Eye Of The Tiger" by Survivor.  The first video that was created of him was "Sexual Heavy" which had the first ever picture of him being shown. This is the original place where the audio was made for the highly popular 'Sexual Heavy in Paradise"    The original comic [1] was made by Rob DenBleyker on 22nd of December 2009, making fun of typical questions asked during a job interview. It was then rewritten for the first time by Michael C. in a comic rewrite contest hosted by Explosm. It was was featured on February 25th, 2012 [2].  In 1997, Swedish student Daniel Malmedahl recorded himself imitating noises made by a two-stroke engine.[1] After he posted this on an unknown website, it grabbed the attention of a Swedish television researcher, who invited Malmedahl to perform the engine noises on television. Researching Within the video Heavy is Spy, the ending scene results of him to kill the opposing team "epicly" while to the tune of Duck Sauce's "Barbra Streisand" and then blowing up the base with explosives while have a ending picture with his face and saying showing an "epic domination" response. The earliest known mention of "Cat Buckaroo" can be found on the communal idea database HalfBakery in a post submitted by user sufc on March 23rd, 2003. The magical art of placing various objects on a sleeping cat and seeing who can get the most on before the cat wakes up in a disgruntled mood and slouches off. Later that same week on March 27th, 2003, Flickr user equestrian_statue[1] uploaded a photo titled "Cat Buckaroo," which shows a cat resting on a couch with a pile of household items and toys stacked on top. Cats can be seen as the ideal type of animal for balancing objects due to their perceived laziness and high threshold for give-a-fuck-ability. The name of the game is derived from the Milton Bradley board game called Buckaroo[2] (shown left, below), in which players must carefully stack game objects onto a mechanical toy mule's back. If the toy mule is affected by a vibration, the spring mechanism would cause all the pieces to fly, and the player who triggered it would be out of the game. Prior to the conception of "Cat Buckaroo," a similar balancing game involving domestic animals has been demonstrated through Oolong the Pancake Bunny (shown right, below) as early as in 2001. The earliest comic using the Genius face was submitted by Cheezburger user antihero to the four pane comic site Comixed[1] on September 1st, 2011.

On March 6, 2005 FanFiction.Net user Alimoe[1] wrote a romance story article titled "Stuck with You" about a love story of Katara and Zuko, which the article became very wide spread then. The first use of the term "Zutara" was coined in a main description of a LiveJournal.com community called katara_zuko[3], that was made on July 26, 2005 by LiveJournal.com user littlebratt[4]. In the main description, there is written: Zutara is our fandom's love [Insert hearts here] On October 24th, 2010, the BBC aired the Sherlock episode "A Study in Pink", in which a waiter mistakenly assumes Watson and Holmes are on a date while they're investigating a murder case at a restaurant.

Within 10 months, the post received over 5,300 notes.          The original joke featured in the Fifa Funnies video "Benzema Gets Bullied" and is presented through a couple of glitches where Piqué in-game knees footballer Karim Benzema (Who is also a La Liga footballer who plays for rivals Real Madrid) to the ground to electronic music and then shouting "LOL!" while a screencapture of his face as if he were saying it appears on screen. This continues as Piqué then trips Benzema in-game and says it again (In KSI's voice). This can be seen in the video below after 33 seconds.  The scene comes from the SpongeBob SquarePants episode "Walking Small," which aired March 22nd, 2000.[1] In the episode, Plankton tries to build a mega-sized Chum Bucket at Goo Lagoon, and uses SpongeBob to get rid of the fishes on the beach.

Researching Filename threads originally begun with people intentionally mislabeling pictures, but it wasn't until April 16th, 2008, when the earliest archived Filename Thread appeared titled "Subtled Filenames"[1] and was posted on /v/. Unlike later filename threads, the pictures weren't based around a specific show, but instead tended to be re-titled reaction images. The first known instance of the word "derp" comes from the 1998 comedy film Baseketball by South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. During a scene where they are caught smelling underwear taken from a woman's private drawer, Matt runs out of the room and says "Derp." The South Park episode "The Succubus" originally aired on April 21st, 1999 introduced a character named Mr. Derp, who briefly served as the chef's replacement.[1] In this episode, the character performs various slapstick clichés like striking himself on the head with a hammer while exclaiming "Derp!" The expression has been used in a number of other South Park episodes, most notably in Season 6, Episode 15 "The Biggest Douche in the Universe" (2002) and Season 8th, Episode 6 "They Took Our Jobs (2004)." The use of the term in the early 2000s was dominated by the influence of South Park episodes, as evident through a number of tribute YTMND sites that were uploaded as early as in May 2004.[6] The image macros captioned "Derp" were first seen on 4chan's /b/ (random) board circa July 2006,[7] according to Encyclopedia Dramatica's entry on the series (said entry is no longer on the site). Prior to the emergence of "derp," other indecipherable phrases have been used for reverse-captioning threads such as fgsfds and hurr durr.       The phrase "Surprise Motherfucker" was first used on the show Dexter[7] by the character James Doakes[8], played by actor Erik King[9], in the season one episode "Born Free."[19][20] In the episode, the protagonist Dexter Morgan (played by Michael C. Hall) take a trip to the shipping yard to inspect a container that he suspects to be the site of his mother's murder, when Doakes suddenly confronts him by saying “Surprise, Motherfucker.” This episode originally aired on premium cable network Showtime on December 17th, 2006. Doakes' quote from the scene soon became a memorable one-liner among fans of the show on LiveJournal.[11] It was eventually introduced to a broader audience in December 2008 when a five-second clip of the quote was uploaded onto YouTube and subsequently featured on Reddit[18] in October 2010. As of May 2012, the video has accumulated more than 1.98 million views.    On July 7th, 2010, the Rej3ctz released the song "Cat Daddy"[1] (shown left) as a bonus track off their album TheFUNKtionon.

On June 22nd, 2007, an anonymous 4chan[1] using a moniker S.S. Walrus posted a creepypasta describing a hostile entity known as SCP-173 to /x/ board, using a photograph of an art piece Untitled 2004 [7] by Izumi Kato for illustration. On October 9th, 2018 Redditor[9] dasMaymay discovered the original /x/ thread[2] in an online archive[10]. According to the original description, SCP-173 had to be observed by no fewer than three personnel at a time to keep it immobile. The description of the SCP bore strong similarities to Weeping Angels from the British television series Doctor Who, first introduced in the episode "Blink"[8] that aired on June 9th, 2007. SCP-173 is animate and malevolent, if given the chance it will kill anyone within its line of site. It's weakness however is that it does not move while being watched. Despite this paralysis it is still highly dangerous; able to cover at least 2 meters in the literal blink of an eye. It typically kills by either snapping the victim's neck from behind, or grabbing the victim's throat and strangling him.

In September of that year, several of his photographs were featured on news sites including The Daily Mail[3], New York Daily News[4], Metro UK[5], and the Telegraph.[6] Portuguese news site Busk[8] shared several other photos of Russian teenagers mimicking Dupri's style that month. On November 23rd, 2011, Dupri was interviewed by Russia Beyond the Headlines[6], in which he stated that the views he captures greatly outweigh the risks he takes to photograph them. A video of Dupri and his friends scaling a freestanding structure for photographs was first uploaded to YouTube on January 7th, 2012, by DeAeMe. A photo taken while this video was being filmed won an award in the 2012 Best of Russia photography competition[10] organized by the Telegraph UK.   since the version 0.1 A-F released the meme was started to spread.

One of the earliest photos uploaded to Flickr documenting this practice was taken on August 12th, 2005 by Royce Williams[5] as part of his Drive By Googly Eye Project (far left). In December 2005, a Flickr[4] pool was started to collect these types of images but did not define where users could place their googly eyes. In 2009, an artist named Tommy posted a series of three photos[10] on his blog from a project he abandoned titled "Things With Googly Eyes on Them." He had purchased the domain name but never went through with the project. Since then, images of googly eyes on objects were collected on various single topic blogs including All Googly[9] in 2009, Googly Eyes on Stuff[7], We Love Googly Eyes[6] and Googly Eyes on Things[8], each in 2011. Eyebombing.com was registered on October 25th, 2011 to two Danish artists[11] looking to "define and refine" the practice of placing googly eyes on things. The site placed two restrictions on what type of photo would be considered "eyebombing": the images could only consist of wiggle eyes on inanimate objects found in public space.

The style was developed by the artists of InfiniteContinues[1], a videogame blog that concentrates on video game related art. The first collection of the series titled "Street Fighter – Abstract Edition" was posted onto InfiniteContinues' website and Flickr account[2] on August 6th, 2010. This time, the idea was to go really, really basic. Initially, it felt like a Bauhaus/De Stijl inspired piece, but once it was finished, it also looked like the primitive graphics from Atari 2600 or Intellivision consoles. Contrary to what its name suggests, abstract pixel art draws references to pop culture icons and therefore it may be considered a misnomer by technical definition of non-representational (abstract) art.[14]   On February 16th, 2002, Body Building[10] forums member squirrel submitted a post asking how to work a specific arm muscle. In the thread, forum user bubbaT responded with, "yo'all better shut ya fukin mouth yo bee-yotch," to which user Chris C replied "do you even lift?"    The rage face's origins can be traced back to comedy central program South Park. In which Canadians heads are unconnected.   On March 31st, 2012, computer programmer Will King took photographs of runners at the annual Cooper River Bridge Run in Charleston, South Carolina. King uploaded a set of almost 100 photos to Flickr[4] and Facebook, where one of his friends dubbed the man "Ridiculously Photogenic Guy." On April 3rd, 2012, King submitted the Flickr photo to the /r/pics subreddit in a post titled "My friend calls him 'Mr Ridiculously Photogenic Guy'", which received over 40,000 up votes. According to an interview with King published by Charleston City Paper[7], King posted it to Flickr around lunchtime and within an hour, it had reached 300,000 views.  6O163 uploaded the original video to YouTube on March 26th, 2012. The video used a gif animated picture, that was uploaded to the image sharing website Imgur by Tim Avery (TheTimAvery) accompanied by the ending theme song of the game Super Mario World composed by Kōji Kondō. The origin of the dog picture was uploaded to WeKnowMemes on March 5th, 2012.   This meme seemingly originated on can.vas, where users sometimes randomly post such changes in the Pony board. On July 14th, 2004, a guest poster using the handle "Lonely" posted a message asking anyone to talk to him about any subject to the MovieCodec.com forums.[1] In the first 24 hours, the post only gained two replies from what seemed to be spambots[9] which were later removed. The phrase originates from the song “Club Can’t Handle Me”[4] by rapper and singer/songwriter Flo Rida[1] and featuring house artist David Guetta[2]. It was recorded for the Step Up 3D[3] soundtrack, which was released on iTunes on June 28th, 2010. As of April 2012, the official video on YouTube has over 106 million views. The song was met by positive reviews and critical acclaims, peaking at number nine on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and topping the charts in Ireland, Poland, Portugal and the United Kingdom. Reflecting its mainstream popularity, numerous covers of the original song soon emerged on YouTube in 2010 and 2011, most notably "Club Can't Handle Me (Indian Style)" which has over 11 million views as of April 2012.   The earliest known instance of McNuggies was uploaded onto Tumblr by blogger Matt[1] (a.k.a Wolfgang) on March 16th, 2012 where it accumulated more than 5,000 likes and reblogs in less than two weeks. After Matt's post, the illustration was picked up a day later by the adult imageboard site Rule34[11] by a user named Decanter. Before the McNuggies post, Matt already created several other similar images using characters from Tribes[12] and Homestuck[13], amongst others.[14] Although these all didn't receive the same amount of notes as the McNuggies image. "Ronald-kun" mentioned in the image refers to the Japanese version of McDonald's character Donald McDonald.  The phrase originated from a memorable dialogue scene in the 1998 cult comedy film The Big Lebowski.[1] In the scene, the main characters The Dude (played by Jeff Bridges) and Walter (played by John Goodman) are approached by Jesus Quintana (played by John Turturro) who taunts them both before, to which The Dude replies "…that's like, your opinion, man." Jesus Quintana: You ready to be fucked, man? I see you rolled your way into the semis. Dios mio, man. Liam and me, we're gonna fuck you up. The Dude: Yeah, well, you know, that's just, like, your opinion, man. Jesus Quintana: Let me tell you something, pendejo. You pull any of your crazy shit with us, you flash a piece out on the lanes, I'll take it away from you, stick it up your ass and pull the fucking trigger 'til it goes "click." The Dude: Jesus. The Fairview Goat Tower was built in 1981 by the winery’s owner Charles Back[7], a year after Fairview founded their Cheesery. Since goats are known for their curious nature[9], many breeds are known for their tree climbing[8] agility. The towers were built with spiraled staircases since goats can climb more efficiently when the object is on an angle.[10] The Goat Tower first received major online attention in May 2009, when Illinois farmer David Johnson built a 31-ft. tall replica of the one in South Africa. The story was first reported in a BoingBoing article titled "Goats enjoy living in their own tower"[16] on July 12th, 2009 and it was reblogged by others including Instructables[17] and animal blog Goat Berries.[18] On 4chan, the first Goat Tower thread was posted to /fit/ (Health and Fitness) on August 23rd, 2011.[1] The thread posed the question "would you rather get a blowjob from the girl of your dreams, or turn into a goat for a day so you could access the goat tower?" Most users picked the tower, with some anons harassing those who would choose otherwise. The origin of the joke was used in a skit called "Charlie Murphy's True Hollywood Stories" created by Dave Chappelle and Charlie Murphy for Dave Chappelle's show called Chappelle's Show in 2003. The scene is starring Rick James, played as Dave Chappelle, and Charlie Murphy.  The post-adjective "much?" construction has been used for ironic emphasis at least since 1978. As it was documented in this SNL sketch: October 7, 1978, episode (Season 4, Episode 1), with The Rolling Stones as host, the teen nerds Lisa Loopner (Gilda Radner; William Safire (1992) spelled it “Lupner” in On Language; Not! New York Times Magazine. March 8, 1992, 20.) and Todd (Bill Murray) are hanging out in Lisa’s kitchen: TODD: I really need your help with my history homework. LISA: Well, Todd, you know if you sincerely need my help, you can count on it. TODD: Oh, good. Because I’m studying all about [grabs at Lisa's shirt neck and tries to peek down her shirt] underdeveloped nations! LISA (shouting and smiling): Cut it out, Todd! Cut it out! [lightly swats him away] Stop it! TODD (points at Lisa’s chest and mock laughs to a pretend audience): Underdeveloped much?   On May 10th, 2005, an episode of the medical comedy show Scrubs titled "My Changing Ways" first aired. The episode features the Janitor convincing his nemesis JD to eat a pie laced with laxatives by eating some himself. When they're both in the bathroom suffering from the effects of the laxatives he says the line "Totally worth it." The phrase first appeared online on November 27th, 2007, as the titled of a comic posted by DeviantArt[6] user wedgejaeger, which depicts a character from the video game Mass Effect shooting an unarmed man to stop an argument.       A facebook group named "Most Beautiful Teen Contest" had facebook users posting pictures of themselves of friends in order for other users to vote on them. An apparent "team" of people began to participate in what is known as "trolling" trolls often have names they go by in order to keep anonymity, the two main trolls in this instance shall remain nameless. After some lude and abrasive comments were made on one post a facebook user took it upon themselves to post a picture of one of the trolls on the very page they were trolling. This picture was taken from a public folder on the troll's facebook. immediately this provoked a response from almost everyone who was actively posting on the group at that time. for reference the group was in the 150k + members at this time. The troll who had his picture posted added more embarrassing photo's of himself. This resulted in captions being made with the photo used and with more photo's being ripped to have captions added the amount of photo's grew and grew. new variations were being made every couple of minutes. The captions were in the form of motivational posters. The posts grew as did the interest in the group, eventually one unknown user following the facebook event posted the results to 4chan. The character first appeared in the South Park episode titled “Asspen”[1], which takes place at a ski resort in Aspen, Colorado. In the episode, Stan, Cartman, Kyle and Butters are given ski lessons by an instructor named Thumper who repeatedly warns about dangerous skiing practices saying “you’re gonna have a bad time.” The episode aired on March 20th, 2002. On February 14th, 2012, the first "Super Cool Ski Instructor" image macro was uploaded to Quickmeme[2] with the caption "If you're trying to hit the front page without tits or a cat / you're gonna have a bad time." The same day, it was posted to the /r/adviceanimals[4] subreddit accumulating over 3,700 up votes within six weeks.       According to a post on the Healthy Pet Food Guide[2], the original clip was featured on America's Funniest Home Video sometime in 1998. The clip first appeared online in a talking cat compilation video uploaded to YouTube on April 6th, 2006. On June 11th, YouTuber pkwvermittlung uploaded the isolated clip of the Oh Long Johnson cat in a video titled "Oh Long Johnson… – talking cat." As of March 30th, 2012, the original compilation video has received over 790,000 views and the isolated clip has received over 5,450,000 views. "Oh my dog. Oh Long John. Oh Long Johnson. Oh Don Piano. Why I eyes ya. All the live long day."   On March 22nd, altered images of a middle school textbook illustration (shown left) of Du Fu's poem "Deng Gao" ("Mounting High") were posted on the Chinese microblogging site Sina Weibo.[5] The images were made in celebration of the poet's 1,300th birthday, portraying him as a variety of different characters including a sniper, delivery man and Internet surfer (shown right). According to an article in the Chinese Internet culture blog China Whisperer[6], the series was named "Du Fu is Busy." Du Fu lived from 712-770 during the Tang Dysnasty and is highly regarded as one of the greatest Chinese poets of all time. He is often compared to other renown literary figures such as Shakespeare, Virgil and Ovid.    According to Snopes,[1] a photograph of a woman's breast with photoshopped lotus seed pod clusters began circulating via email as early as 2003. The image was accompanied by a a copypasta story about an anthropologist whose breast was infected with larva during an expedition in South America. After anthropologist Susan McKinley came back home from an expedition in South America, she noticed a very strange rash on her left breast. Nobody knew what it was and she quickly dismissed it believing that the sores would leave in time. Upon her return she decided to see a doctor after she started developing intense pains. The doctor, not knowing the exact severity of the case, gave her antibiotics and special creams. As time elapsed the pain did not subside and her left breast became more inflamed and started to bleed. She decided to bandage her sores however as Susan's pain grew more intense she decided to seek help from a more certified doctor. Dr. Lynch could not diagnose the infection and told Susan to seek the aid of one of his colleagues who specialized in dermatology whom was sadly on vacation. She waited for two weeks and finally was able to reach the dermatologist. Sadly, a life changing event was about to unfold during her appointment. To Miss McKinley's surprise, after she removed the bandages, they found larva growing and squirming within the pores and sores of her breast. Sometimes these wicked creatures would all together simultaneously move around into different crevices. What she didn't know was that the holes were in fact, deeper than she had originally thought for these larvae were feeding off the fat, tissue, and even milk canals of her bosom. The holes were 5 cm deep. She was operated on and the larva was removed from her breast. Therefore always take a slight rash serious and have the eggs removed before it is to late. Cheers and may the creatures leave you in peace. On May 5th, 2005, SocialPhobiaWorld[4] user holephobia submitted a post titled "Phobia of Holes," in which he invited others to share information about the phobia and linked to his now defunct Geocities[3] webpage Holephobia. On May 23rd, 2005, Margot Charlton of the Oxford English Dictionary's "Ask Oxford" service replied to a letter from Hole Phobia's webmaster suggesting that the phobia be named "trypophobia" rather than "trypaphobia."[2] "I should perhaps point out that the "a" of trypa represents the ending of a Greek feminine noun, and would normally be replaced by "o" in a combination ('trypophobia')." The slang exists since the beginning of the twentieth century in black american accents. The origin of the slang is still unknown until today. On April 4th, 2011, Lionsgate announced in a press release[11] that actor Josh Hutcherson would be playing the role of Peeta in the film adaptation of The Hunger Games. On April 22nd, the first instance was posted to the "Advice Peeta"[5] Tumblr blog with the caption "Throw bread away? / Give it to your crush."[6] In less than a year, the post received over 140 notes. I don't get it has been used in comics and memes on 9GAG[1] and Reddit[2]. Certain users[3] have speculated that it also might be the oldest known meme ever.   The photos were uploaded to the anonymous photo-sharing site Imgur.[2] The man in the photos has yet to be identified. The photograph of Drake was taken sometime in 2005 to promote the fifth season of the Canadian TV series Degrassi: The Next Generation, which premiered on September 19th, 2005. The earliest known reference to Drake's fictional character Jimmy and his wheelchair can be found in a demotivational image macro with the caption "they see me rollin, they hatin". The image spread across the blogs in 2009 and the Facebook page titled "Drake in a wheelchair"[9] was launched on August 5th that same year.      On March 8th, 2012, YouTuber ForumLinkzMann uploaded a video titled "How To Shut Down A Ho….As Demonstrated by Goku from Dragon Ball," featuring a segment from an episode of the anime series (the original video has since been removed). The video shows the character Bulma attempting to make a deal with the show's main character Goku, a young boy who has possession of one of the legendary Dragon Balls. Bulma offers to let Goku peek underneath her clothes if he gives up his Dragon Ball; however Goku, being a young child (and also being unaware of the differences between men and women), rudely rejects her offer and says she has a "dirty, old fanny". The video then quickly cuts to a a memorable scene from the 1995 stoner comedy film Friday in which Craig Jones (played by Ice Cube) and Smokey (played by Chris Tucker) yell "daaaaaamn" and another clip from a 2011 viral parody video of rap battle showing the riled up crowd supposedly reacting to Goku's harsh rejection. The video accumulated over 600,000 views within one week and spawned several remixes and parodies. The video has since been removed due to channel termination. On February 18th, 2007 YouTube Pooper Bobomb99 uploaded his first version video showing a scene from the 1991 TV series Super Mario World. Luigi over-repeats his phrase Or is it the bagle by replacing the word "bagle".      Are You Retarded was originally created on www.quickmeme.com as a macro caption image     My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic is a Canadian/American flash cartoon series, produced by Studio B Productions, based on the My Little Pony universe. It was developed for television by Lauren Faust, who also did major work on both The Powerpuff Girls and Foster’s Home for Imaginary Friends. Since its on-air debut in October 2010, the series became a popular subject of threads, reaction images and image macros on 4chan. Fans outside the show’s demographic, especially teen and adult male fans, have come to be known as “bronies”, and occasionally use ponies to derail threads. Although fans are generally known as bronies all across the internet, on 4chan, bronies who post ponies mainly on /co/ have been called “colts”. Also, female fans of the show have been referred to as “pegasisters” on occasion, though this isn’t as popular as the term brony.    Researching The surrealist act of literally eating money was first demonstrated in a YouTube video[1] uploaded by American hiphop artist Tyga sometime in September 2008. The original video, which has been since removed from the site, shows the rapper eating two $100 dollar bills.   The meme originated with the Italian Facebook group Differenze Linguistiche[1] created on February 27th, 2012. The first image example (shown right below) presented different ways to say "I love you" in Italian, English, French, Spanish and with emphasis on the rather harsh-sounding German translation "Ich Liebe Dich." Though the exact origin of Latte Art remains hazy, the trend presumably began in Italy. In the United States, the practice of microfoam drawing was popularized by Seattle coffee shop Espresso Vivace owner David Schomer[1] during the 1980s and 1990s. By 1992, Schomer had developed the popular rosette pattern (shown below) from a photograph he had seen at Cafe Mateki in Italy. On July 15th, 2002, LatteArt.org[10] was launched as a barista's resource website for latte art-related tutorials, images and video.     The first instance of this song is "Boxx of Roxx" featuring Boxxy. It was uploaded on June 1, 2011.  On March 17th, 2012, Tel Aviv-residents and Israeli graphic designers Ronny Edry and Michal Tamir launched a Facebook campaign with pacifist slogans addressed towards Iran, affirming their love for the Iranians and assured that "Israel will not bomb Iran." The original instance was created by Edry himself and uploaded onto the Facebook page of Pushpin Mehina, a small graphic design preparatory school. In the season 2 finale of the Walking Dead, there is a scene where Hershel is shooting zombies with his shotgun and it continues for quite sometime, making it look like he has infinite ammo. One of the earliest known notable parody of le can be found in Jason Windsor's flash animation video Ze End of the World posted to Albino Blacksheep on October 30th, 2003. The first Urban Dictionary entry detailing the humorous usage of le was uploaded by user ricemond on Dec 4th, 2003.[3]. Tracing the origin of its use in Rage Comics is difficult, but it likely originated with one of the two following comics posted on Reddit sometime in 2009.      On January 23rd, 2012, the original instance of the meme was submitted to Reddit[5] by Ian Davies, a long-time friend of Kyle since elementary school, using a yearbook photograph of Kyle with the caption “Takes driving test . . . gets first DUI.” The original post received less than 5 up votes. Later that day, another macro was posted to Reddit[2] with the caption "Tries to stealthily fart in class / shits" (below right) which reached the front page of the /r/adviceanimals subreddit accumulating over 3,300 up votes in less than 2 months. The phrase was first used by an anonymous 4chan user in response to an /x/ (paranormal) board post[1] re-telling the "who was phone?"[1] story, an often-reposted creeypasta originally posted in 2008 that is well-known for its comedic element: "A FEW YEARS AGO A MAN WAS WALKING DOWN A ROAD BECAUSE HIS CAR BROKE DOWN AND HE SAW A CAR COMING UP BEHIND HIM SO HE STUCK OUT HIS THUMB TO HITCH HIKE AND THE CAR STOPPED AHEAD OF HIM. HE RAN UP TO THE PASSENGER SIDE AND OPENED THE DOOR. WHEN HE OPENED THE DOOR A SKELETON POPPED OUT" The story is often accompanied by a clip art of a skeleton (shown below), in a similar vein to its usage in 2spooky.       The term came from the video "Awesome Series: Link to the Awesome" which was uploaded on Feb 14, 2012 and is apart of egoraptor's "Awesome Series" which are a list or parodies to popular video game franchises. The parodied game was "A Link to the Past" which was,released in the year 1991. It was developed and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System video game console. The main plot of the video is that Link finds his uncle in the dark underground caverns of Hyrule Castle. The clip shows the scene where link finds his uncle seriously wounded, after giving him the advice to hold the B button to focus power in the blade then release it using the secret technique handed down by their people, he says "Link you can do it cough. Save the princess cough. Zelda is your… She is your.." He then dies before he can finish which causes Link to over-react to trying to find out if she is related to her in order to have intercourse and a relationship with her, while yelling out the phrase "ZELDA IS MY WHAT?" while trying to get him to "wake up".   Sound files are mainly found within program files of downloaded games on a computer. Users have then found these files and uploaded them within YouTube for easier access of those files to used within Gmod videos and Team Fortress 2 Movies with Dialogue from the actual character. Mowtendoo uploaded the original video titled ":D" to YouTube on March 1st, 2012. Within three weeks the video accumulated over 44,000 views. (official reupload shown below) The video used a clip from the 2010 Old Spice commercial "Zoom 15" starring American actor Terry Crews accompanied by the song SigSig.   On March 14th, 2012, a post titled "Just a book owners smile…" was submitted to the /r/funny[9] subreddit with a photo of a young girl posing with three Goosebumps books and her mouth agape in excitement. A comment posted by Redditor plantlife[10] linked to a Quickmeme submission of the photo with the caption "Gersberms / Mah fravrit berks." The same day, the image macro was submitted in a post titled "BERKS!"[1] which reached the front page of Reddit accumulating over 17,000 up votes within two weeks.   As early as 1992, Usenet posters were sharing both humorous and serious confessions in newsgroups, but they were never completely anonymous.[7] However, since Usenet posts were often tied to professional email addresses, this was not an ideal space for truly anonymous confessions. On August 22nd, 2000, the site AnonymousConfession.com[5] was created, accepting confessions in a number of categories including real life embarrassing moments, stories of cheating on one's significant other (shown below), true crime, work infractions and lofty wishes. On March 14th, 2012, a thread[1] was posted to 4chan's /v/ (video games) presenting the theory that the final marauder[3] Commander Shepard encounters in Mass Effect 3 was actually the game's final boss. One of the earliest comments in the thread gave the character its name, Marauder Shields, based the type of protection he was using which was noted on the health bar over the character. Soon, others followed up with Manly Tears and one-line comments that read: "his name was Marauder Shields."  Photo Booth was first introduced by Apple in October 2005 as a standard webcam application for all Macintosh computers with a built-in iSight camera.[1] Although it remains unclear when or where Mac users began sharing their Photo Booth recordings online, one of the first notable instances was uploaded by YouTuber DucksWithHooves on July 10th, 2009. Titled "Pretty Girls Make Faces", the video shows a woman laughing hysterically at herself while playing around with the "warp" effect from the software (shown below, left). On November 4th, 2010, YouTuber Yazzy O’Brien uploaded an edited version of DucksWithHooves' recording without any special effects (shown below, right). Within five years, the original video gathered more than 3.9 million views and 8,200 comments.  The photograph of Otunga originates from WWE's annual Elimination Chamber pay-per-view that took place on February 19, 2012 at the Bradley Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Otunga was involved in a segment where he would join former champions Alberto Del Rio, Mark Henry and Christian, to show their support for General Manager John Laurinaitis. All five men then proceded to celebrate in the ring with Otunga taking picture with his phone. The next day, Otunga tweeted the picture, causing it to spread in the internet wrestling community. A Tumblr account quickly followed the tweet.         While the original artist is unknown, the animation was used as a background for a YTMND site on September 3rd, 2005[1] and the image was credited as coming from 4chan. According to BMX Board[5] user ruthlessrobbie, the original clip was taken from the transexual adult film TSBitches starring Cristina Bianchini. The clip was used in a YTMND page titled "Ridin Spinnaz"[1] created on May 5th, 2004, which featured the 2003 rap song "Ridin Spinnaz" by Three 6 Mafia.    The black and white silhouette pose of a faceless man smoking a cigarette with his arm stretched over a couch first appeared as the final shot in Mad Men's[1] opening credits.[3] Though the man is faceless, he is supposed to represent Don Draper[14], the protagonist of the show played by actor Jon Hamm. The title sequence was designed by the creative studio Imaginary Forces[2] for the show's premiere on July 19th, 2007. It won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Title Design in 2008. A single topic Tumblr[5] was created on February 3rd, 2012 in anticipation of the show's new season, scheduled to premier on March 25th, 2012. Two images were initially shared with the launch of the blog, but contributions were not consistent until later in the month.  The song Untitled (How Could This Happen To Me?) was recorded by the french-canadian pop punk music band Simple Plan in 2004. The single was released on the April 1, 2005 by Lava Records.        The phrase "bumping egg threads" began on the popular online video game Roblox. Starting in 2008 Roblox would feature events around spring time known as egg hunts. Players would have a limited amount of time to complete tasks to find eggs which would give them prizes. This event continued until 2011 when, much to players melancholy, suddenly stopped. This had caused many players, mostly trolls, to search old forums centered around the old egg threads and post in them, causing the threads to be moved up to the front page. Players would see these egg threads and be disappointed when they noticed the date. The name "Inglip" stems from a randomly generated CAPTCHA image that read "Inglip Summoned," which was then turned into a popular CAPTCHAart comic strip. On January 8th, 2011, a Reddit[1] user posted a Rage comic strip entitled "Dark Captcha magic" featuring a CAPTCHA caption which read "Inglip summoned." The concept of summoning spirits and communicating with otherworldly underlings via CAPTCHA soon caught on with other Redditors in the f7u12 subreddit[2] and after several more iterations, it quickly developed into a full-fledged cult with an elaborate story about Inglip and his Holy Grail to establish his kingdom "Trathira" on Earth. The word "feels" was popularized by the Internet slang expression "I know that feel bro", with the earliest instances rumored to have appeared on the German image board Krautchan in May of 2010. On February 6th, 2012, a user named “Voyack” posted an "ask me anything" (AMA) thread on Reddit,[2] asserting that he was the Krautchan user “Wojak” who created of the meme. "Night of Nights" was originally arranged by Japanese amateur musician/producer BeatMARIO (ビートまりお), a member of the popular doujin group COOL&CREATE. The song was based on the Sakuya Izayoi's stage theme Flowering Night (フラワリングナイト), composed by series creator ZUN for her appearance as a boss character in Touhou: Phantasmagoria of Flower View, the 9th installment in the Touhou Project series.[1] The remix was initially compiled with other Touhou remixes in a three-disc compilation album titled "花詠束 – hanataba -" (trans. Bouquet – hanataba -) and was released at the Touhou convention Reitaisai 4 in Japan by the group Unionest.NET on May 20th, 2007.[2]  One of the earliest examples of the meme was submitted to FunnyJunk[1] in a post titled "Pokemon According to My Mom" on June 18th, 2011. The chart shows a variety of Pokemon all labeled Pikachu with the only exception of the actual Pikachu who is described as "that one yellow mouse thing." The same day, a post titled “Pokemon According to my Dad” was posted to a Tumblr user's since deleted blog. The post gained over 25,000 notes before it was deleted.  During the episode "Just One Bite" (Season 3 – Episode 43b) when Spongebob tries to eat a Krabby Patty, this arguemnt starts to happen when Spongebob states that a Krabby Patty is "good for you" The earliest parody was uploaded on the February 24th, 2010 by YouTuber SSBB0273 The first commercial was aired in the middle of the 90's on the german TV. Click here to watch the video. Then in 2006, there was aired the second commercial starring a kid asking why the sausage is called Deutschländer, while an old person answered, that the sausage is mixed with other famous german sausages. He said the sausage would be crispy like wieners, spicy like frankfurter sausages and tender like bockwursts. The first parody was uploaded on the January 25th, 2007 on MyVideo by Marcel Düvier. Click here to watch the video.  The earliest known instance of a celebrity name pun image macro appeared on the art message board b3ta[9] on September 8th, 2008. The first panel was a photoshopped image of American actress Reese Witherspoon[8] holding a spoon. The second panel removed the spoon from her hand and was captioned “Reese Withoutaspoon.”   The reaction face originates from a comic series called "Hitman" in one issue on page 20 where Dr. Jackson, a local resercher from Gotham City, is seen burning and shredding papers. Bueno then shows up with his head leaning back, his tounge sticking out and saying "bueno".    The phrase first came from Episode 16 of Season 1: "Sonic Rainboom". In the beginning of the episode, Rainbow Dash is teaching Fluttershy how to cheer properly. However, when trying it out, the saying is soft, not requiring up to Rainbow's standards. After trying again repeatedly and one last one with a huge amount of air, it still comes out the same. The scene ends with Rainbow Dash falling backwards and Fluttershy saying: "Too Loud?" confused in the problem of her last cheer. Other included phrases in the show This one however was used in the episode  Filename extensions[1] originate from file formatting[2] on various operating systems like Windows and Linux. The first operating systems only had a minimal amount of filename extensions to determine the file's generic type, for example .txt for text, .mus for music and .exe for executable applications. As computer technology continued to evolve, additional software programs were developed to handle a wide range of data types. Along with this growth, the diversity of filename extensions continued to expand, some of them even becoming associated with certain product versions.[3] Filename extensions are displayed as a suffix placed behind the filename, indicating the contents and type of the file. On the English-language web, the earliest known usage of filename extension in substitute of an actual media file can be attributed to Facepalm.jpg, which became adapted by users on 4chan imageboard as a quicker alternative to posting a reaction image of Facepalm, beginning sometime in early 2007. In the Spanish-speaking online communities, an Internet legend built around a peculiar photo of a man referred to as Tio.jpg became widespread as early as in 2006.  On March 4th, 2012, Redditor BrettBr0wn submitted a post titled "Chillin at the kitchen counter"[8] with a photo of a cat posed as if it were sitting like a human. In the thread, several photoshopped variations of the image were posted. The same day, a post in the /r/funny[7] subreddit titled "it was you…. it was you this entire time!" included an animated GIF of a cat playing with a feather (shown left below). The following day, Redditor DarkCoyote submitted a post titled "Introducing, Chris Hansen Cat"[2] with an image macro (shown right below) captioned with "Why don't you have a seat / how long have you controlled the feather?"    On January 6th, 2010, Tumblr implemented the ability to ask other users questions,[1] which was designed to foster user-to-user communication[7] and anonymous interaction without resorting to third-party commenting services like Disqus.[8] The trend of character roleplay blogs on Tumblr began with the launch of Ask Homestuck[9] blog on April 23rd, 2011, which allowed its readers to interact with any character from the webcomic Homestuck. The first post featured a drawing of Karkat answering an anonymous reader's question about another character from the series. (Researching) The first notable instance of the image macro was the Single Service Tumblr "Doctor Who Addict"[4], which was created in February 2011.  Although the etymology of the phrase remains unclear, a poster in the psychedelic drug enthusiast BlueLight[5] forum claims the use of phrase “tripping balls” dates as far back as 1985, referring to bouncy balls that served as talismans to help people connect with reality while under the effects of a hallucinogen. One of the earliest mentions online comes from the post script of a drug report on the online psychoactive plants and chemicals library Erowid[7]submitted on June 13th, 2000. The phrase has been increasingly used in popular novels, films and TV shows, with the earliest notable mentions found in the 2004 comedy film Harold & Kumar Goes to White Castle and numerous episodes of South Park.[12]  Video Games such as Team Fortress 2 have folders containing all of the responses to their characters that people are able to collect and upload in one whole video     The earliest YTP video version was uploaded on the May 14th, 2011 by YouTuber Kacksalber. The origin of the meme is unknown. A Redditor [1] who later deleted their account published the earliest available version of the meme on the /r/funny subreddit on February 29th, 2012, claiming to have found it on 4chan's /b/ messageboard. The post received more than 1,100 points (87% upvoted) and 495 comments in less than a decade (shown below).        The first comic date back to the 15th November of 2011 on Dejimachan’s /b/ board with the introduction of the comic. The comics’ stories were mostly about funny street life circumstances that lead to a confused reaction. The first Aziz comic. The earliest picture was uploaded by Stevie Junglas on the July 10th, 2011 in the most liked Andreas Facebook fangroup Halt Stopp! Jetzt rede ich. with over 300.000 likes. The Rimshot was invented by the jazz and big band drummer Gene Krupa, and has since then been used over the years by many comedians and musicians. After the invention of the rimshot many other comedians and musicians have been playing this note to either refine their skills, or just highlight a really lame joke. The usage of the rimshot has been dated back since the 1960's during Gene's life time. The grammatically incorrect phrase "If it fits, I sits" stems from a wordplay on the slogan "If It Fits, It Ships" adopted by the U.S. parcel service United States Postal Service for its holiday advertising campaign in 2009. Since the broadcast of the TV commercial, the slogan became occasionally used as the title for photo threads on Reddit[2] showing cats snugly resting in cardboard boxes. The earliest known instance of the image macro series was posted on the ICanHasCheezburger blog[1] on October 10th, 2011. It featured a photograph of a cat resting inside an egg carton with the caption reading "If it fits… I sits."  The drawing is based on a photo of some asian man taken in or around New Jersey sometime in 2012. On March 6th 2012 this new incredible meme was submitted to a little known website called Know Your Meme[1] and it took off from there. The original photo has been found on 3/14/12 on facebook. This asian guy goes by the name of Dave and has a rather large following on twitter. The facial reaction was caused by the rumor of someone stealing his car, which he loves extremely. He held this face for over 20 minutes before he was able to see if his car had actually been stolen or not.  The first known use of this phrase was used in the MMORPG Runescape when a player[1] noticed the phrase being used.   The earliest britain Art Attack YouTube Poop version was uploaded on the August 19th, 2008 by YouTuber APlasticTree001. The earliest italian Art Attack YouTube Poop version was uploaded on July 24th, 2010 by YouTuber GamesUniverso95. The earliest spanish Art Attack YouTube Poop version was uploaded on the January 25th, 2009 by YouTuber vicente0409. Feo is a spanish meme it translates as "ugly". The first two lines "Roses are red, violets are blue" were inspired by Edmund Spenser's 16th century epic poem The Faerie Queene[1], in a section describing a man viewing a fairy woman bathing herself on a summer's day. In the late 18th century, another Roses are Red rhyme was published in the nursery rhyme collection Gammer Gurton's Garland[2], titled "The Valentine." Furthermore, Victor Hugo used a similar styling in a song sung by Fantine in his 1862 novel Les Misérables[3], while the character was reminiscing about a lullaby she used to sing to her daughter Cosette. In 1988, American Children's Folklore[4] compiled 14 derivatives of the original rhyme, both with positive and negative connotations. Other variants[5] have appeared in a number of television shows, songs, books, films and video games including Kurt Vonnegut's 1973 novel Breakfast of Champions[6], Bob Dylan's 1989 song "Where Teardrops Fall"[7] and the 1991 comedy film What About Bob?.    Shiro was born on March 8th, 2002, according to the blog's profile page.[1][2] A single topic photo blog dedicated to the cat was launched on February 17th, 2006 by an anonymous blogger and Shiro's anonymous owner.     The earliest parody was uploaded by YouTuber schnubbidubbi2000 as a dubbing parody. The video was uploaded on the January 5th, 2010. 21 days later, YouTuber Baenki uploaded his first YTP version.   The original stock photo (shown left) was submitted to the Australia Associated Press[9] covering the Schoolies festival on Queensland, Australia's Gold Coast. on November 21st, 2009. On November 23rd, 2011, Redditor NorthernSkeptic submitted a post titled "Introducing Sudden Clarity Clarence"[2] that included an image macro (shown right) with the caption "Oh my God / dubstep sucks." The thread subsequently reached the front page of the /r/AdviceAnimals subreddit. The original picture is of actor Charlie Stewart who is probably best known for playing Bob in the TV series The Suite Life of Zack and Cody.        The Cape Crew was created in 2010 by Youtuber TheUltraSpriter.[1] The Cape Crew has a large cult following and is considered one of the best modern day internet only cartoon series.  Aki Higashihara[1] was recruited by the Tokyo-based talent agency Platinum Production in 2000 while still attending high school. She made her mainstream debut as the model for the advertising campaign of Japanese beer brand Asahi in 2002. In the following years, Higashihara continued to pursue her modeling career in gravure idol magazines and host various programs on Fuji TV, including a horse-racing related news program. While working as the program's host from April to December in 2007, Higashihara became associated with bad luck after rumors spread on the web that whichever horse she predicts as the winner would lose the games, even the most popular race horses.                   In the 2004 comedy film Anchorman, Ron Burgundy (played by Will Ferrell) says the line "I'm not even mad" in response to his dog Baxter supposedly confessing to eating an entire wheel of cheese: What? You pooped in the refrigerator? And you ate the whole… wheel of cheese? How'd you do that? Heck, I'm not even mad; that's amazing. How 'bout we get you in your p.j.'s and we hit the hay. The phrase "I ain't even mad" has been heard in hip hop and R&B lyrics, most notably in Cherish's 2008 R&B single "I Ain't Trippin'" and Young Money Entertainment's 2009 hit rap single BedRock.   On February 26th, 2012, Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie arrived at the 84th Academy Awards' red carpet ceremony in a strapless black Versace dress with a split revealing her leg. Being one of the most well-known celebrity runway events of the year, Jolie's red carpet entrance became a much talked-about topic during and after the awards ceremony.       The Original Stardust Speedway Bad Future Music Sample from Sonic CD was Remixed and used for Metal Sonic's theme in Sonic Generations.The Remix Consists of a more Salsa-Steampunk like tune,along with a new Segment that sounds Alien and Morbid. Sometime in 2011, @Opwronghole (now deactivated) posted a GIF from The Walking Dead Season 1 episode 6[2] depicting a zombie getting its brain scanned to Tumblr[1] (shown below). The original scene can be seen below, uploaded to YouTube in 2014 (shown below). Sometime later, user @Chaystar reblogged the post, writing, "This is someone dying while having an MRI scan. Before you die, your brain releases tons and tons of endorphins that make you feel a range of emotions. Tragically beautiful." Later, @livinglovelyalways commented, "THIS IS FROM THE WALKING DEAD YOU FUCKING IDIOT. DON'T YOU SEE THE AMC LOGO ON THE RIGHT. god". The original post gained over 290,000 notes, but is now lost. A screenshot of the interaction has been reposted numerous times around the web, including a post to Imgur[3] on December 18th, 2012 garnering over 11,000 views in roughly 9 years (shown below).   The phrase "You mad, 'cause [I'm better than you]" is a dissing technique found in the context of hip hop music, with its roots in freestyle battling. The phrase can be often heard on "diss tracks"[1] or songs primarily intended to disparage or insult others (example shown below, left). The first image macro using the phrase featured the Harlem-based rapper Cam'Ron pointing off camera with the overlaid text "YOU MAD." The still image came from a segment on the Bill O'Reilly Show (shown below, right) where Cam'Ron appeared with producer Damon Dash to debate whether or not rap was harmful to children in November 2003. DAMON DASH: How do you hurt children by promoting to be an entrepreneur and a CEO and to do right… (CROSSTALK) O'REILLY: Hold it! Hold it! You're looking at a principal… CAM'RON: Why don't you want to let him talk? You mad. You mad. O'REILLY: You won't let me finish. CAM'RON: Where did you start, A Current Affair, right? O'REILLY: No, wrong. CAM'RON: I'm going to get at you in a minute. O'REILLY: You go ahead. You get at me. CAM'RON: I'm going to get at you in a minute. This is a useless meme based on Disney's 2012 movie "Brave". In the teaser, the woman says "Be carefull what you wish for, my mother would say".  The image of Jesus comes from the website "Jesus Christ Leadership" (http://www.leadership-with-you.com/jesus-christ-leadership.html) and shows Jesus looking towards the viewer. See more on Know Your Meme     The first video in the series, "APPLE.MOV", was uploaded to "YouTube":/memes/sites/youtube on October 11th, 2011. It featured the character Applejack from the MLP:FiM series being obsessed with apples. The video was also featured on Equestria Daily the same day.[7] As of February 20, 2013, APPLE.MOV has over seven million views.   The earliest known use of the acronym is attributed to Adam Mesh from the third season of the NBC reality show The Average Joe. Mesh launched the “You Only Live Once” (YOLO) clothing line on March 20th, 2004.[2]  The song was written by Tyga and produced by DJ Mustard for the Well Done 2 mixtape released on July 18th, 2011.[4] The music video for the track was uploaded to YouTube on September 8th, 2011 and accumulated over 33 million views in six months. Months later in January 2012, Tyga released another music video for the official remix version, which featured numerous high-profile rappers including Wale, Fabolous, Young Jeezy, Meek Mill and T.I. On December 5th, 2011, the first Urban Dictionary definition was submitted by user Suburbanite2012, who claimed that "Rack City" was a slang term for Las Vegas, Nevada. However, the validity of the entry remains disputed. The single topic blog, Cholafied[1], was created on February 13th, 2012 by Californian art student Michael Jason Enriquez.[2] The first post[9] on the blog featured Nicolas Cage in Chola style makeup.  The phrase and image are derived from a scene from Season 3, Episode 3 of Spongebob Squarepants titled "Just One Bite". In the episode, Spongebob attempts to get Squidward to eat the main food sold by the restaurant they both work at, The Krabby Patty, after learning that Squidward has never eaten one before and in an attempt to prove to him that no one can resist loving a Krabby Patty after having one bite. After he takes a bite, Squidward pretends not to enjoy it but unknownst to Spongebob does and has become addicted to them. The climax of the episode ends with Squidward breaking into the vault of Krabby Patties before being discovered by Spongebob who comes to the realization of Squidward's love of Krabby Patties by making the face and uttering the line. The first image on Quickmeme[3] was submitted sometime in April of 2011 and featured the caption "Hey, wanna play Minecraft? / Tricks you into sucking his dick."  The origin of OMG RUN Guy is currently unknown. On March 30th, 2010, JoyReactor[1] user "anon" uploaded a collection of Rage Comics featuring OMG RUN Guy (examples shown below, left and right). This is the earliest known collection of the character.  When the foreigner stood up, he announced about his life and his war. But everything he said, had nonsence. His phrase Wotsch mini fetli ha? is very popular on switzerland. (Go to 5:24 on the video down below:)  The original uploader was youtube.com/havoksage. According to the creators comments he works for a games company and made the video for fun. This isn't the first time Halo's spartan super soldiers have urge to break it down. In an april foolds video from 343 industries the Spartans parody dance central.   On 2/18/2012, funnyjunk.com, a well known image-based website, was spammed by pictures of men in Afro wigs, accompanied by the phrase "tight fro wig". This confusing, yet strangely amusing "raid" was all carried out by a single user under names such as "thetightness", "tightfrowigg", and "titeforwig". The term "Itasah" originated from Japan in the 1980s. Originally, it referred to imported high-end Italian cars, but circa 1990s, the meaning shifted from a slang form of "Italian car" (イタリア車, Itaria-sha) to "itai" (痛い, painful), which describes painfully embarrassing or painfully expensive nature of this hobby. During this time, the usage of the term was limited to the inner circles of anime and bishojo manga fans who decorated their car interiors with stickers of anime character. The Itasha style of decoration was likely inspired by other vehicle-decorating fads like Dekotora (decoration trucks) and Bosozoku (motorcycle clubs). In the context of fandom, a similar decorative trend has been previously reported with exterior decal stickers and paint jobs depicting pop singers and idols.     The original thread [NSFW] posted to 4Chan's /b/ board is here. Here, the man's name is revealed as Paul, and one of his friends tells him "keep smiling, Paul", thus giving the macro the name. The first reddit thread was submitted, actually referenced within the 4Chan thread, where the user posted a picture of Smiling Paul on the Millennium Falcon. He was probably karma whoring, because he claimed to actually know Paul IRL. Afterwards came another post, on the 4Chan subreddit, where OP wanted to start a Smiling Paul thread. As it turns out, Smiling Paul is also a YouTube personality as well, having a few songs and videos uploaded there, in addition to his own blog.  Canadian YouTuber Alejandra Gaitan created a new YouTube channel titled "thereplygirl"[2] on July 18th, 2011, where she began uploading videos using thumbnails showing exposed cleavage (shown below, left) as replies to up-and-coming YouTube videos. On August 9th, 2011, YouTuber MeganLeeHeart[1], created the "MeganSpeaks"[6] YouTube channel, in which she began uploading reply videos with similar exposed-cleavage thumbnails of arrows pointing at her chest (shown below, right). Within seven months, the channel received over 10 million views and thousands of dislikes.    During the Development of GIR Goes Crazy and Stuff,an Episode of the Popular Show,Invader Zim ,Jhonen Vasquez wanted a GIR covered in blood in the episode; however, Nickelodeon prohibited it, due to it being inappropriate for any kids who might watch it. Since the image was already drawn, Jhonen, along with J. Bondy, Chris, and Rosearik Rikki Simons (color artists on the show and the voice of GIR, respectively), decided to sneak images of Bloody GIR anyway. WARNING Image Contains Blood,Viewer Discretion has been advised.  The meme originated from a picture of a boy holding nunchucks wearing a yellow superman shirt. The source of the original photo is currently unknown. Notable Examples  Still Researching  The earliest known instance of trolling utilizing this snowclone appeared on the Japanese imageboard site Futaba Channel (2chan), in the first half of the 2000s. The phrase was initially paired with exploitable image macro series Aka-san. After a person clicked a URL expecting pornographic images, they were greeted with a photo of the grinning baby with the caption "What did you expect? It's Me!!".    The earliest reports of being tagged in the Facebook survey meme date back to early 2008, but it only began to pick up momentum in late 2008 and burgeoned into a full-fledged meme in 2009. In early February, an estimated 5 million of these "25 Things about Me" notes reportedly appeared on Facebook in the span of a week. [researching] The first tweet with the hashtag #LessAmbitiousMovies was posted by concept artist Rob McCallum[5] on January 4th, 2011, which parodied the title of the 2010 film Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. Scott Pilgrim vs The Room #lessambitiousfilms — Rob McCallum (@Rob_McCallum) January 4, 2011       "Tik Tok" was originally realeased on August 7th 2009. The song was generally praised by critics and was awarded 5× platinum[4] for sales of over 5 million in the U.S. and sold 12.8 million copies worldwide in 2010 alone. It also broke the record for the biggest single-week sum for a female singer in the U.S, selling 610,000 digital downloads in a week.   The earliest remakes of the Pixar intro were animated by the ELRO Corporation[2]. They uploaded their 3 versions on YouTube on the August 18th, 2006.      It is unknown where the Mothman first originated,but there are rumors of a Shawnee Chief Indian named Cornstalk,who cursed the Ohio River area where he was taken hostage before his execution.The Curse was to lay for atleast 200 Years,and to bring Chaos to West Virginia. On Nov. 15, 1966, two young couples from Point Pleasant, Roger and Linda Scarberry, and Steve and Mary Mallette told police they saw a large white creature whose eyes "glowed red" when the car headlights picked it up. They described it as a "flying man with ten foot wings" following their car while they were driving in an area of town known as 'the TNT area', the site of a former World War II munitions plant. During the next few days, other people reported similar sightings. Two volunteer firemen who sighted it said it was a "large bird with red eyes". Mason County Sheriff George Johnson commented that he believed the sightings were due to an unusually large heron he termed a "shitepoke". Contractor Newell Partridge told Johnson that when he aimed a flashlight at a creature in a nearby field its eyes glowed "like bicycle reflectors", and blamed buzzing noises from his television set and the disappearance of his German Shepherd dog on the creature. Wildlife biologist Dr. Robert L. Smith at West Virginia University told reporters that descriptions and sightings all fit the Sandhill Crane, a large American crane almost as high as a man with a seven foot wingspan featuring circles of reddish coloring around the eyes, and that the bird may have wandered out of its migration route. There were no Mothman reports in the immediate aftermath of the December 15, 1967 collapse of the Silver Bridge and the death of 46 people, giving rise to legends that the Mothman sightings and the bridge collapse were connected.However,there have been more reports of The Mothman in other areas,around the time of 9/11(New York),The Swine Flu outbreak in Mexico, and other Major Disasters. The still photo is from a scene in the 2000 film Gladiator.[2] After the main character, Maximus Decimus Meridius, defeats his opponent in battle, Emperor Commodus gives a thumbs down in a dramatic gesture of disapproval, thereby requiring Maximus to kill his opponent. The first instance of the image macro was posted to the Advice Animals subreddit[11] on July 6th, 2011 but did not receive any points. However, another instance posted the next day[12] received 2735 up votes and 698 points, reaching the frontpage of Reddit.          A YouTube user named GAYPENlS, now OLDSACKS [1], uploaded a video (around 2010) named sexual heavy.wmv featuring the character Heavy mixed speaking strange, dirty and weird things and noises. The picture in the video included the Heavy with Dr's Dapper Topper hat and holding an odd HWM face. Since he closed his old account, the video doesn`t exits. But on September 3r, 2011, was re-uploaded ,the video has over 36,000 views as of date. Later, the Youtube user Scoutellite made another Smexual video named "Sexual GRN Team" who was another popular video response, but due the confusion about the origin of the fad, Scoutellite closed his YouTube account. In Oct 9th, 2012, the re-uploaded again, only with 5,600 views. On November 5th, 2010, the webcomic blog Antics Comic[1] published a six-pane comic titled "Survival Insticts" in which two men embrace each other in an arctic blizzard in order to stay warm, causing a seal to yell "GAAAAAAYYYY." While speculative at best, the seal's punchline bears similarities to the line "Ha, Gayyyyy" shouted by Señor Ben Chang, a recurring character in the TV sitcom series Community, in an episode that aired on September 23rd, 2010.  The footage comes from the second episode called "Mother Tucker" on season 5 of FOX's animated TV series "Family Guy", that was first released on September 17, 2006. At the beginning of the episode the family are attending the Airshow in Quahog and are shown to be anxiously awaiting one of the pilots to crash. When the pilot landed, Peter expresses his Boredom and would rather watch the tape of The Ring at home. But before Peter put the cassette on the player, a woman was warning him watching this because it would kill him. Peter didn't believe her, so he played the video but there was showing the 1987 film Mannequin and it has the same effect as the cursed tape. After 2 years, a parody of this scene was made by YouTube user "wzl63" with the title "peter griffin watch is child,s play 3", which was uploaded on June 22nd, 2008 featuring a footage of the horror movie "Child's Play 3".  The original Linning video was posted to Youtube on February 7, 2012 by user mcastro983 on Feb 7, 2012. The video showed the recent New York Knicks recruit Jeremy Lin doing a secret handshake with fellow player Landry Fields before a game. The handshake was composed of things like flipping through a book and putting away nerd glasses. This was most likely making fun of Lin's time as a Harvard student.   The song "Fasten Your Seatbelt" is from Pendulum's fourth overall single, the double A-side Tarantula / Fasten Your Seatbelt[2], which was released on June 27th, 2005 by independent label Breakbeat Kaos (shown below) off of their debut album Hold Your Colour as the album's third single. The first YTPMV made with the song is "Fasten Your Squidbelts" which was uploaded by a YouTube user Chinelin[3] on the February 17th, 2011. The video included the 2nd episode of the Nickelodeon series Spongebob Squarepants remixed with the song. The video has since been taken down, and no known re-uploads exist.     On February 16, 2012, The Montreux Jazz Music Blog revealed the official promotional poster for the 46th season of the Montreux Jazz Festival[1]. The poster turned out to be a black-and-white photo of a nude man walking through a desert landscape by photographer Greg Gorman[2]. [photo:252519] Apparently, the picture was thought to be somewhat ridiculous, because later that same day, the Facebook group "Le Monsieur Tout Nu"[3] (The Naked Man) was created, which was quickly followed by Tumblr blog "Lost naked man…"[4] Both were dedicated to displaying humorous altered versions of the original poster, either changing or replacing the nude model or placing him into other scenes, similar to the photoshop fads 9/11 Tourist Guy or perhaps more apropos, Naked Man in La Redoute Advertisement. On May 23rd, 2011, Russian photographer and animator Denis Borisovich began posting videos of his cat Skifcha wearing the white paper craft glasses on the video sharing website Vimeo.[1] The first upload, which accumulated over 1.2 million views within 9 months, featured Skifcha performing a parody of the dramatic prairie dog video.     The webcam-style video monologue was uploaded by YouTuber KillaKarisma[5] on February 14th, 2012. The video shows KillaKarisma confessing his dream of transforming into a Super Saiyan, which he attempts to demonstrate by taking his shirt off and screaming for an extended period of time. The video ends with KillaKarisma saying "my name is Jalen and I am a Super Saiyan." The first photo of Jackson Blankenship[4], a freshman at the University of Alabama, and the cutout of his face at a home game against the University of Mississippi was posted to Reddit[8] on February 4th, 2012. Titled “Distraction done right,” the thread received a score of 1874. Blankenship's photobombing technique was also featured on ESPN during the broadcast of the game.                The first Scumbag DNA image macro with a yellow strand of DNA was posted to the Advice Animals subreddit[1] on August 20th, 2011, although it only received one point and faded away. The series took off months later with another instance posted to Reddit[4] on December 23rd, which received 7832 upvotes and 6409 downvotes. The base photo for the Quickmeme page was taken from the stock photo site WallpaperStock.[2] The phrase was made by the song titled Are you gonna Bang? by Funky Dee. The song appeared to the community as a joke at most times, due to the silly nature and occasionally immaturity from the viewers, as the phrase essentially means "Are you going to have sex?" Also, many dislike the song, as the music sounded much like it didn't suit any typical situation.   on February 9, 2012, YouTube user "TwilightStocking"[2] uploaded the video "Pony Sauce", a selection of poses of Twilight Sparkle: Within 5 days, 25 response videos[3] had been uploaded, and the original video had received 25,000+ views. While the video wasn't the first to use the song or title style, the previous video was a YTPMV that didn't use the slideshow style of visuals. The phrase originates from FunnyJunk. On June 16th, 2010, an image macro of a frowning gorilla with the overlaid text "That really rustled my jimmies" was posted by an anonymous user who has currently deactivated his account.[23] On July 18th, 2012, the image had an overall score of over 100 with nearly 7000 views. The original photograph of the gorilla can be found in a Flickr post titled "nors"[7] uploaded by Frank Wouters on July 4th, 2007. The phrase went relatively unnoticed until December 15th, 2010, when a thread was made on 4chan's /r9k/ board about "times when someone really rustled your jimmies."[1] It was told in the style of a normal greentext story on 4chan, except using the outdated language from the 1950s. The absurdity of the phrase "Rustled Jimmies" instantly led to a variety of responses to the OP, most notably the similar FunnyJunk image of the frowning gorilla. On February 6th, 2012, during a luncheon in Beverly Hills, California for Oscar nominees, an AP photographer snapped a photo of actor Jean Dujardin[1] joking around and pretending to fall asleep on George Clooney's[2] shoulder. Both men were attending the luncheon for their nominations in the Best Actor category[13]; Dujardin for his work in The Artist[14] and Clooney for his work in The Descendants.[15] The photo was published on Metro UK[3] the next morning. The next day, a single topic Tumblr titled Jean Sleeping On People[4] was created by Belgian Tumblr bloggers Jonathan and Roberto[16], who uploaded six photoshopped versions along with the exploitable template of Dujardin's face. The original contributions included Dujardin sleeping on Barack Obama, Batman, and a teletubby.  Titled "The Bongcheong Dong Ghost," the original webcomic was written and illustrated by Korean web cartoonist Ho-Rang and submitted as his entry to Naver Webtoon's 2011 Mystery Short contest, which ran from July 12th to September 13th, 2011.        Adventure Time premiered on April 5, 2010 with the episode "Trouble in Lumpy Space" being the second shown. It was the episode that introduced the character Lumpy Space Princess or LSP for short. She is known for having a typical valley girl attitude while having a boyish voice at the same time. In the episode, Finn and Jake need to get into Lumpy Space in order to get the antidote for "The Lumps" which Jake has caught. They approach a toad that acts as a gatekeeper and asks for the password. LSP then shouts out her password "WHATEVERS2009", which has been said to be a password that the typical teenage girl would have.           The "How it Really Is" (Science Student) instance of the series was first spotted on Facebook February 7th, 2012. The chart summarized various preconceived notions and generalizations that are associated with that field of study. On February 8th, 2012, Tommy Jordan posted a video on his Facebook[1] page in which he scolds his 15-year-old daughter Hanna for posting a curse-ridden status update about her parents on her Facebook page. In the video, Jordan reveals that he was able to bypass her security settings which had blocked him from viewing the update. After reciting her Facebook post, Jordan concludes his rebuttal by shooting Hanna’s laptop with a .45 pistol (seen at 7:10 in the video below). The Facebook post received over 74,000 likes, 30,000 shares and the YouTube video accumulated over 20 million views within five days.  The song “Go Die! Valentine’s Day” was included in Fujioka Fujimaki’s second album, Fujioka Fujimaki III, released on April 18th, 2007. The lyrics reflect the anger and resentment of a single man who did not receive any chocolate on Valentine’s Day, as it is marketed in Japanese culture as the day when women gift men candy as a sign of affection.[2] As of February 2013, a YouTube mirror of the original song has amassed more than 310,000 views.

According to Google custom searches, the earliest instances of the text can be found on a number of optical illusion-related webpages cached in January 2001. By mid-September 2003, various versions of the following text began spreading around via e-mail, blogs and web forums, which was noted by writer Brian Sawyer[1] in a blog post published later that same month.

Languagehat, which may have been the initial site that popularized the copypasta, cites their source as the blog "Uncle Jazzbeau's Gallimaufrey"[2], in which blog author "Jim" links to a number of published articles that seem to be related to the phenomenon, as well as an earlier post on his blog in which he posted a similar piece of scrambled text that did not have the viral spread of "Aoccdrnig": [R]andomising letters in the middle of words [has] little or no effect on the ability of skilled readers to understand the text.

Hitchert began the Facebook page for BH Ideas[3], on January 9th, 2012. Described as "A fully interactive way of engaging with social media. Exchange ideas, manage ideas, make contacts," BH Ideas became a springboard for Hitchert to talk about sports, politics, and merchandise with the company's logo on it. Hitchert posts status updates on Twitter[4] on both his personal Facebook and the brand page several times throughout the day. These include discussing a new merchandise ideas, quoting a famous or influential person, or personal updates on his day.       On April 1st, 2003, FARK hosted a photoshopping contest with the theme "What if Fox News were around during other historical events?"[1] Nearly 200 monochromic images featuring Fox News Channel's logo and news ticker were posted to the contest thread.      The Legend of Zelda CD-i (Compact Disk interactive) games were developed in late 1993 as a partnership between the Dutch electronics company Philips and the Japanese videogame publisher Nintendo to encourage the production of CD-based games.[2] The CD-i games were received overall negatively and are still considered some of the worst games of all time. Nintendo never acknowledged them in the Zelda timeline, and therefore they are considered to be in a separate, self-contained, canon. Upon release, all of the Zelda CD-i games were criticized heavily for their bad gameplay, horrendous controls, confusing design, and ridiculous cartoon cutscenes. Their full-motion video cutscenes have become widely available through video-sharing websites like YouTube. One of the recurring characters throughout the series was King Harkinian.[1]  While Facebook pages for university-specific memes didn't arrive en masse until February 2012, the earliest known Facebook Memes page[31] was created for Florida International University of Miami on October 1st, 2011. The first uploaded image featured a Y U NO Guy image macro with the caption "FIU / Y U NO make touchdown?" In the following months, McGill Memes[26] Tumblr blog and The App State Memes Facebook page were created for McGill University on November 6th and Appalachian State University[30] on December 5th, respectively. The origin of this popular catchphrase is in the early 2003 when Dave Chappelle made a skit on his own show called "Chappelle's Show". His skit is called Charlie Murphy's True Hollywood Stories and this has 2 parts. The origin of the catchphrase is in the second part. Rick James, played as Dave Chappelle, was on cocaine and slapped Charlie Murphy in a bar. Then Charlie get angry and slapped him back. Then in Rick James' interviewed part he explained his action by saying: (Go to 6:24 in the video down below)   The video was uploaded by YouTuber POLICEMAN110Tube on January 9th, 2011. In 13 months the video accumulated over 900,000 views with over 8,000 likes and 350 dislikes. (intro) I go to sunburn salon to burn my skin. [Yeah galish man declaration] GO!GO!GO!GO!GO!GO!

Cooking with Skrillex[1] started on January 11th, 2012 by Canadian piercing artist Carly Lemiuex, well-known on Tumblr as carlovely.[2] The first image posted was of Skrillex looking surprised in front his turntables, which had been turned into a stovetop range. Playing off of the popular mechanism in dubstep of "dropping the bass"[5], he was seen as dropping bass fish filets into a pan. The original photo[4] was posted to Imgur on November 14th, 2011, with over 16,000 views as of February 2012.              While the actual origin of the comic is still being researched, the first notable appearance of this comic was on the website MyLittleBrony.com, where it takes place at Hasbro. A board member suggests that they make the toy version of the character Princess Celestia look more like she does on the TV show.   (researching) The phrase itself has been around for many years, often being connected to African American culture. One of the earliest(?) recorded instances is from Will Smith, in I, Robot:   One of the earliest known morphing effects was used in the 1985 music video for the song "Cry" (shown below, left) by the English rock duo Godley & Creme. The video used an analogue cross-fade technique to produce the effect since morphing computer software was not yet available. The first film to use digital morphing was the 1988 fantasy Willow. In 1991, the sci-fi blockbuster film Terminator 2: Judgement Day used morphing for the shapeshifting villain character of T-1000, and the music video for Michael Jackson's single "Black or White" included a sequence of people morphing into one another at the end of the song (shown below, right): Morphing computer software programs like FotoMorph[3], FantaMorph[2], and Gryphon Software Morph[4] became available in the early 1990s. I Love Bees (also known as ilovebees or ILB for short) was an alternate reality game (ARG) that served as both a real-world experience and viral marketing campaign for the release of developer Bungie's 2004 video game Halo 2. The game was created and developed by 42 Entertainment. Many of the same personnel had previously created an ARG for the film A.I. titled The Beast. I Love Bees was commissioned by Microsoft, Halo 2's publisher. I Love Bees was first advertised by a subliminal message in a Halo 2 trailer; players who investigated the titular website discovered that the pages appeared to be hacked by a mysterious intelligence. As players solved puzzles, audio logs were posted to the ilovebees.com site which gradually revealed more of the fictional back-story, involving a marooned artificial intelligence stranded on Earth and its attempts to put itself back together. I Love Bees was a marketing success; 250,000 people viewed the ilovebees website when it was launched in August 2004, and more than 500,000 returned to the site every time the pages were updated. More than three million visitors viewed the site over the course of three months, and thousands of people around the world participated in the game. I Love Bees won numerous awards for its innovation and helped spawn numerous other alternate reality games for video games. The earliest known use of the word “singularity” in the context of rapid technological change can be attributed to Polish mathematician Stanislaw Ulam, who wrote about his conversation with Hungarian-American mathematician John von Neumann in May of 1958. "One conversation centered on the ever accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue." The idea of an “intelligence explosion” in which machines would be able to improve themselves over-and-over was first written by British mathematician Irving John Good in 1965.[5] “Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultra-intelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an "intelligence explosion," and the intelligence of man would be left far behind.” The term “singularity” was popularized on the Internet with science fiction writer Vernon Vinge’s 1993 article “The Coming Technological Singularity: How to Survive in Post-Human Era”, which was published on his faculty page on the San Diego State University website.[6] The main subject for this fad is the maniacal laughter of the villain protagonist Light Yagami (Kira) appearing in the 19th chapter of the manga series. This chapter is also famous for the exploitable fad L's intro.  One of the earliest instances was posted via r/AdviceAnimals by Redditor cchsbball23 in a thread titled "Rebellious Asian"[1] on January 30th, 2012. The original instance hosted on imgur[2] gained over 820,000 views in the first 72 hours of upload. The image was positively received across Tumblr[5], Quickmeme[3] and Memebase[6] among other humor blogs, the original template image has yet to be located anywhere online. The unavailability of a blank template image has led to a number of complaints and requests in the comments[2], while some Memegenerator[4] users have uploaded cropped or altered versions of the original image as substitutes.           The first use of the phrase "bitch I'm fabulous" online was on September 15th, 2007, when Blogspot[1] blog bitchimfabulous published its first post. The first image macro featuring the phrase was a photo of a pomerian puppy and was uploaded to imgfave[6] on January 3rd, 2011. Dental Plan/Lisa Needs Braces comes from a scene in the season four episode of The Simpsons "Last Exit to Springfield," which originally aired on March 11th, 1993. In the episode, Mr. Burns introduces a new contract to his workers that eliminates their dental plan in exchange for a keg of beer. This creates a conflict for Homer, one of Burns' employees, because his daughter Lisa needs braces. As Homer waits for his beer, he overhears the character Lenny say, "So long dental plan." This triggers two thoughts for Homer: Lenny saying "dental plan," and his wife, Marge, informing him that "Lisa needs braces." The phrase plays repeatedly in Homer's mind while his brain tries to make the connection between loss of his dental insurance and having to pay out-of-pocket for Lisa's braces, i.e. "Dental Plan" and "Lisa needs braces."[1] On June 19th, 2005, Urban Dictionary user Olly J defined "dental plan, Lisa needs braces": "A timeless phrase, used with great versatility. you can say this at pretty much any time or situation but definitely works best when said during one of those long awkward pauses in a conversation. Sometimes shortened to simply "dental plan…" let open to completion by others present, or simply left abbreviated." In 1999, Something Awful founder Rich “Lowtax” Kyanka began publishing a series[7] of transcripts illustrating his prank conversations on ICQ[8], the first internet-wide instant messaging system. The seventh in this series, titled “Space Robot Bonanza~”[2], was published on April 7th, 2000. Over the course of the conversation, Lowtax tricked a New Zealander ICQ user with the handle Corn_Boy into believing that he was a programmer who designed intelligent robots. By the end of the conversation, Corn_Boy appeared to be convinced that he was talking to the robot and it had pushed Lowtax down the stairs in order to protect him from a “terrible secret of space.”      On May 25th, 1985, Japanese video game developer Magical Zoo released the video game The Screamer for the Japanese home computer, the PC88,[1] later ported to the PC98 as well. At the beginning of the game, a chyron sets the action of the game with the following Engrish text: On August 6th, 2007, YouTuber grace5592 published a video of the game's opening. The post received more than 26,000 views in less than 13 years (shown below).   "The Next Episode"[5] is a rap song by American rapper Dr. Dre featuring Snoop Dogg[6], Nate Dogg and Kurupt. It was originally released in October 1999 by Aftermath Entertainment as the lead single of his second studio album 2001. The song's main sample incorporated David McCallum's "The Edge." Perhaps most notable for its open advocacy of marijuana consumption in the lyrics, the song received generally positive reviews from the music critics, who credited the album with rejuvenating the west coast gangster rap scene.  On November 22nd, 2010, Tumblr[1] user Selina Zawacki uploaded a photo of the Pokébra (shown below, left), along with several pictures of herself modeling the undergarment. Zawacki revealed that the inspiration for the bra design came from a webcomic (shown below, right) by Tumblr user mis0happy.[4] On December 19th, 2011, Redditor elbuencharlie submitted an image macro featuring a photo of a dark-haired bartender in a post titled "Good Girl Gina,"[8] but it went virtually unnoticed with 28 downvotes and 0 points. On the following day, Redditor karmadogma submitted a post titled “Introducing Good Girl Gina”[7] to /r/AdviceAnimals with an image macro featuring a photo of a smiling brunette woman and the caption reading “Uses your bathroom / Puts seat up when she’s done.” The post earned 30 upvotes and 4 points. While the name of the model[14] is currently unknown, the original image was photographed by Jacob Yuri Wackerhausen[6] and posted to iStockPhoto[5] on March 27th, 2009. The original photograph was posted via Facebook as a profile picture on August 29th, 2011 and the first captioned instance was posted sometime in September 2011, according to Redditor ShivamJ[7], a close friend of the man depicted in the image. On March 10, 2009, the YouTube channel ImmaVegeta was created. That same day ImmaVegeta uploaded his first video (shown below).  The original cat bread photo was posted to both Reddit[1] and Tumblr[3] on August 2nd, 2011, where it received over 51,000 notes in six months. It was reshared on humor blogs Tastefully Offensive[4] and Bits and Pieces[5] the same day. On the 19th of that month, it was posted to the pics subreddit[2], receiving 8,095 up votes and 6,964 down votes. The commercial was uploaded via Volkswagen's official YouTube channel[1] on February 2nd, 2012. It begins with child actor Max Page dressed as the young Darth Vader from Star Wars saga, who tries to test his psychokinetic powers on various household items around the house, albeit unsuccessfully. Halfway through the video, the resigned looking Vader nearly quits his experiment before making one last attempt on his dad's Volkswagen sedan Passat. Only then the car engine miraculously turns on, leaving the young boy startled about his mystical power. The video ends with his parents looking out to the driveway from inside their home, using the remote control start button to turn the ignition on and off.   On September 22nd, 1970, the first “Spanish Inquisition” sketch was aired in Season 2 Episode 2 of Monty Python’s Flying Circus (shown below). On several occasions throughout the sketch, an English townsman says “I didn’t expect a kind of Spanish Inquisition” in retort to a woman's incessant questioning, which would prompt a group of men dressed in Spanish Catholic robes to storm into the house and proclaim “Nobody expects a Spanish Inquisition!” As one of the most celebrated sketches from Monty Python's Flying Circus, the catchphrase has been referenced and parodied in many other works of comedy and fiction in popular culture, beginning with its inclusion in Issue #3 of the DC comic book series Batman Family published in January 1976.      In October 2007, Experian Consumer Direct began airing an advertising campaign featuring singer Eric Violette as a man struggling with difficult life circumstances due to his poor credit score, and his ignorance of it. The commercials feature jingles written using various distinctive forms of popular music. To date the company has aired nine different commercials, which have aired in different orders in different markets. The commercials featuring Violette and his band stopped airing in February 2010 to focus advertising on FreeCreditScore.com and a new band. The AD's Fame lead to spoofs and many parodies over the internet, like Freedumbassreport.com.  The first instance of the rage character was submitted by 9gag[1] user aldik101 in a post titled "Let's watch a movie, if you know what I mean" on January 28th, 2012, featuring a screen capture of Rowan Atkinson from the 2007 comedy film Mr. Bean's Holiday (shown below, left). As of November 7th 2012, the post accumulated over 43,000 likes, 3,300 Facebook shares and 240 comments. The same day, an extended version of aldik101's comic was posted by 9gag[2] user elyo11, who added a vectorized version of Atkinson's expression along with the caption "If you know what I mean" (shown below, right). In 2008, two comedians Evan Mann and Gareth Reynolds and Director Todd Strauss-Schulson made a sketch comedy video called Jagg Off    The first known instance of "When Did This Become Hotter" image compared modern female celebrities like Keira Knightly and Nicole Ritchie to 1950’s era pin-up stars including Marilyn Monroe and Bettie Page. While the creator of the photo is unknown, the image entered circulation via Facebook sometime in early January 2012, making its way onto Twitter as early as January 16th when Yoga teacher Kathryn Budig tweeted[2] a link to the image. embrace your bodies + curves!we're on the same team as our body--love it, treat it right and know you're beautiful. twitter.com/kathrynbudig/s… The first Tumblr instance was posted by Running Thin on January 14th[8], but it didn't gain momentum until a second instance was posted on the 19th[1], receiving nearly 400 notes in X period The series was inspired by Successful Black Man, an image macro series that first emerged through 4chan in 2010. The image template stems from a stock photo available on iStockphoto and has been previously featured in web advertisements. Within the series, Sherlock receives advances from a character named "Molly", who is a mortician at a local hospital. He usually shows indifference or ignorance in response, though it's uncertain whether he is aware of it. Because of this, many of the fans of the show have taken to poking fun at his seemingly ignorant stance on sexual or relational matters. The template that is used in the series first appeared on Meme Generator[1] in March of 2010, and only gained moderate attention. The image of Cumberbatch used in the template comes from the second episode of the first season, "The Blind Baker": Some examples dealt with other plot elements, but most examples that were generated played off of the above-mentioned sexual ignorance. Human attempts at high altitude exploration of near space date back to 1783 when French physics professor Jacques Charles invented hydrogen-filled balloons.[1] Charles and mechanical engineer Nicolas Robert launched the first untethered balloon on December 1st of that year.[14] The technology moved forward in the 1980s with the development of Amateur Radio High Altitude Ballooning (ARHAB)[2], pioneered by amateur radio hobbyist Bill Brown, known by his handle WB8ELK.[15] On August 15th, 1987, Brown launched the first balloon with his modern amateur radio transmitter. The Loudoun Amateur Radio Group of Northern Virginia began a series of similar experiments in 1999[19], followed by the inception of Balloon Experiments with Amateur Radio (BEAR)[16] in May 2000 by a group of Canadian amateur radio operators from Edmonton, Alberta (shown below, left). The ARHAB programs remained mostly an exclusive activity for scientific research purposes until the 2000s, when the costs of Global Positioning System (GPS) technology and digital cameras began to fall. As a result, high altitude ballooning became a more common hobby among amateurs and space enthusiasts. Some of the earliest clips of recorded footage were uploaded onto the website of CosmoCam[9] (shown above, right), a project launched in February 2002 by Rocket Science Inc. in collaboration with NASA and the Columbia Scientific Balloon Facility. The Lord of the Rings The phrase “My precious” originates from Peter Jackson’s 2002 film adaption of J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings : The Two Towers scene when Gollum/Smeagol makes his first OFFICIAL appearance to Frodo & Sam and becomes a central character. Here, before Gollum assaults them both as they're sleeping, he crawls down a rocky cliff. He is furious & cussing both hobbits for having stolen his "precious", The One Ring of Power that Frodo bears. On January 31, 2011, YouTube user DurhamrockerZ made a YTP video called "Youtube Poop: John Deadcorn". In it in you see Dale get a robotic voice and start to dance on 1:03 – 1:08. Due to popularity, an extended version called "Robo Dale Marital Dance", was posted on Febuary 3, 2011 (sans the robotic "Wait a minute, I have a wife"). It is that video that is most recognized and is the video that set the foundation of future parodies. The song that is played during the dance is the called Grabbag by Mark "TDK" Knight, the main theme of the video game Duke Nukem.  The term "Friend Zone" was coined in the November 3rd, 1994 episode of the American television sitcom Friends titled ""The One with the Blackout." While Ross is pining over his friend Rachel, Joey tells him that he waited too long to act on his feelings for her[1] and was running out of time to be able to change their friendship into something romantic. By the end of the series, Ross and Rachel (shown below) end up married.  The photograph of the teenager named Tim in question was taken by (presumably) the user twitwer14[1]. He wote "This is a picture of one of my friends and i thought it would be funny to create a meme out of it. I think it has potential." The earliest known Ticked-Off Tim reference was in 2010 (presumably).   The Lord of the Rings The phrase “What is it? What do you smell?” originates from Peter Jackson’s 2002 film adaption of J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings : The Two Towers scene when Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli pursue the Uruk-hai in Rohan, who have taken Merry and Pippin prisoner. The Uruk-hai unaware of their pursuers take a halt because one of their Uruk snuffler caught a "man flesh" scent following their trail. At that moment, the Uruk leader asks him : "What is it? What do you smell"? and then the Uruk snuffler answers back "Man flesh".       "Sexy and I Know It" is a song by American electro-hop duo LMFAO from their second studio album, Sorry for Party Rocking. It was released as the third single from the album on September 16, 2011. The song was written by Stefan Kendal Gordy, GoonRock, Erin Beck, G.M. Robertson and Kenneth Oliver, and it was produced by Party Rock. The song became the group's second number one hit on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, making them the first duo to have two successive number-one singles since OutKast's "Hey Ya!" (2003) and "The Way You Move" (2004). The song also reached number one in Australia, Canada and New Zealand, and charted within the top 10 in nearly every country in which it charted. LMFAO – I'm sexy and I know it : The meme originates from a line ferociously delivered by Norman Stansfield, a fictional character portrayed by Gary Oldman in the 1994 thriller film, Léon, known by several other titles including The Professional in the U.S. market. Oldman's deliberate, exaggerated delivery of this and other lines from the film have caused them to become quote-worthy and referenced in other contexts, as well as causing the Stansfield character to become notable in film critiques. The line plays out as the following in the film: SWAT Team Leader: Alpha team, man down, man down. Norman Stansfield: I told you. Benny, bring me everyone. Benny: What do you mean "everyone"? Norman Stansfield: EVERYONE! The intense, perhaps even shocking delivery of the line has been seen as both meaningfully dramatic, and also humorous to some viewers because of Oldman's over-the-top style of acting used for the role: Oldman's exaggerated delivery of several other lines in the movie have also made them memorable and repeated in pop culture, most notably, "I haven't got time for this Mickey Mouse bullshit!" The rise in popularity of the phrase "would not bang" can be attributed to the advice animal series Butthurt Dweller, which represents Internet commenters who are smug and judgmental about the physical appearance of others. On August 4th, 2011, a Butthurt Dweller Quickmeme[14] image was submitted with the caption "'That bitch got fat since high school, would not bang' / 90 lbs overweight" (shown left). On September 15th, another Butthurt Dweller image with the caption "6/10 / Would Not Bang" (shown right) was submitted to the image macro site Meme Generator.[12] On January 3rd, 2012, a thread titled "Would not bang" was submitted to 4chan's[1] /b/ (random) board, which featured a photo of actress, model and WWE fighter Stacy Keibler.[2] The image was captioned in red text with criticisms of subtle details in the photo and the words "2/10 / Would Not Bang" in white. The thread received 545 replies prior to being archived, many of which included new versions of the meme.  Redditor MidnRainbow submitted the first instance to the /r/adviceanimals[1] subreddit in a post titled "Introducing: Forever Resentful Mother" on January 25th, 2012, which included the caption "Do your godamned chores / I had a C-section for you" (shown below, right). Prior to being archived, the post received over 2,800 up votes and 115 comments. The theme of dysfunctional motherhood has been previously explored through the advice animal series sheltering suburban mom and single mom, as well as characters in popular sitcoms, such as Lucille Bluth from the comedy television series Arrested Development.     On January 7, 2012, YouTube user CrazyD9421[1] uploaded a video called "Sodic: Ze Healing". It featured a section where the Heavy pauses to think about past events (at 00:10): The same day, CrazyD9421 uploaded a video that featured that section, but the footage in the thought bubble was replaced with green screen so that others could use the clip to make their own versions. He also provided a link to the downloadable file.  The first YTPMV using the song was "manwith10scans" by YouTube user tomgoodmen[4], who uploaded it to YouTube on June 29th, 2010. The video has since gained over 7,000 views in under 6 years.    The phrase "what the fuck" has been widely used both in real life conversations and popular culture prior to its adaption into online slang and image macros. The phrase eventually spun off into its abridged forms "WTF" and "the fuck?" as first documented via Urban Dictionary[1] on March 3rd, 2003 and March 17th, 2004, respectively. The has been notably featured in a LOLcat video known as "'the fuck was that' cat," uploaded by YouTuber webinapage on November 26th, 2009. Meanwhile, the earliest known definition of the term "dafuq" can be found in an Urban Dictionary[2] entry submitted on January 4th, 2009, which explains the phrases as "like wtf, it's ebonics for what the fuck."   The very first video has been created by the youtuber / music creator McMaNGOS in Jan 21, 2012. The video includes a snapshot from the youtube review series, hosted by Mike Mozart. The snapshot is obscured by a play button and the video is playing the "Rock n Roll" soundtrack compiled by the dubstep artist Skrillex.  The clip originally came from the Season 6 episode The PTA Disbands, in which the teaching staff at Springfield Elementary goes on strike, leading Principal Skinner to look for voluntary substitute teachers from the community, including local senior Jasper Beardly. Jasper proceeds to meticulously lay out his master disciplinary plan: "Talkin' out of turn? That's a paddlin'. Lookin' out the window? That's a paddlin'. Starin' at my sandals? That's a paddlin'. Paddlin' the school canoe? Oh, you better believe that's a paddlin'."[1]     The song as well as its music video made its debut on Saturday Night Live on January 29th, 2011. The first known instances of the Jeff the Killer image come from a Japanese site known as pya.cc where there were 2 distinct versions(shown below) The discovery was marked on a Pastebin complete with links to the early instances of the image.[11]    The main heroine of the series, Haruka Amami, is known for having a very peculiar face when she is thinking or thoughtful in the iDOLM@STER games. An anonymous user in /ogame/ (live for online games) in 2channel first created her Shit-JIS Art by Japanese characters "no" (の) and "wa" (ワ) in November 5th, 2007.[1] This was because her eyes looked like the Japanese character "no" ( の) while her mouth looked like the Japanese character "wa" ( ワ). The term "Nonowa" was created by this Shit-JIS art, and at the time it was a nickname for Haruka. However, as this simple "Nonowa "Shift-JIS art was modified by many users in various ways, gradually Nonowa gained a personality of her own. Over time, she morphed from an emote to represent Haruka and became established among iDOLM@STER fans as the super deformed character Nonowa-san.  The starter of this fad was "Newellgen", a YTPMV featuring Gabe Newell which was created by a YouTube pooper mssnor.[2] The day when this video uploaded to YouTube is uncertain because he closed his account later. But it seems that that was around the summer of 2010. On February 25, 2011, the Supernatural episode "The French Mistake" was released, the 15th episode of the 6th season. In this episode, the main characters, Sam and Dean Winchester, are sent to an alternate reality where they find themselves on the set of the show Supernatural, in this world a fictional show like in the real world. There they meet Misha Collins, the actor who plays the angel Castiel in the show, who later on is held at knifepoint by the angelic hitman Virgil. During this scene, Misha begins to cry, as can be seen at 0:50 in the preview clip. Tumblr user "bbc-sherlock"[2] posted a gif of a scene from the episode that featured Collins crying: The gif quickly spread throughout Tumblr, and was quickly edited to only include the crying. The second man was also edited out, being replaced with a black background:  HTTP status codes[12] are a website’s way of responding to a server request made by a visitor. One of the most well-known status codes is 404, the code for “Not Found.” Other popular codes include 500, Internal Server Error or 503, Bad Gateway among others. The "HTTP status cats" project was started by tech blogger Tomomi Imura, known by her handle GirlieMac[9], who began uploading these posters to her Flickr[10]account on December 13th, 2011. Within a month, the set was viewed over 400,000 times. However, parodies and humorous concepts based on the standardized status codes have been seen prior to this project, such as 4chan's anthropomorphized 404 girl Yotsuba Koiwai and the 2011 Greek protest slogan "Error 404: Democracy Not Found."   The original photo was taken by North Carolina family photographer and Redditor Jarod Knoten[1][5] and published to his blog[2] on November 15th, 2011. It was part of a family album set for Dave, whose Redditor handle is dcthomas82[4], his wife Rhiannon and their son Mason at the Museum of Natural Sciences in Raleigh, North Carolina. Dave submitted the picture of his son via Reddit[3] on January 11th, 2012, where it landed on (or just "hit") the front page with 1133 upvotes. The first instance of the image macro was posted on the same day in the comments section with a "Most Interesting Man in the World" type caption. Later that day, a second thread[12] was started in the Advice Animals subreddit deeming the photo “Skeptical Baby,” pairing it with a caption of disbelief. It received 6513 upvotes and a score of 991.  Genderbending is a commonly-used approach in fanmade works from fanfictions to art (see the Rule 63 entry). In fact, hentai doujins featuring gender-bent Haruhi existed in doujin circles before this fad became popular on the web. However, those doujins got very little attention because genderbending is a very minor genre in doujin works. The video which set a precedent for this fad was posted to Nico Nico Douga (NND) on January 31st, 2008.[2] The video featured traces of the cover arts for the characters song CD albums but with the characters gender's flipped. This was the first successful video to make this idea popular among many NND users and Haruhi fans.  On October 17th, 2007, blogger Kelly Stewart[9] uploaded the video "New Media Douchebags Explained" to YouTube. The video criticized people who work in the emerging social media industry, characterizing them as people who don't really work and shameless self promoters. The video has accumulated over 148,000 views as of February 2012.  The scene comes from the episode called Krabby Road, that was aired on March 3, 2008 on Nickelodeon as the first episode in the sixth season of the Spongebob Squarepants TV series.  On the website Woosk.com the user by the same name posted on the 10th of October in 2008 a picture showing a black guy standing behind a girl. This meme originated from the episode "A Bat Divided", from Episode 8 Season 2. In the episode, Batman tries to stop a villain named Doctor X who supercharges a nuclear reactor to cause a nuclear meltdown and power up his alter self. Batman hurls the alter self on Doctor X and the nuclear ray misses Doctor X. Batman is caught inside the energy charge and is split into 3 Batmen. One is a slacker Batman, the second is the scientist Batman, and the third is the Anger and Violence Batman. A video was uploaded to Youtube on February 15, 2010, called "Batman Does Not Eat Nachos!" by Youtube user "treehuginhippy"[1].   The slogan "It's more fun in the Philippines" was developed for a campaign by ad agency BBDO Guerrero/Proximity Philippines for the Philippines Department of Tourism. The website itsmorefuninthephilippines.com[1] was registered on December 29th, 2011 and according to GMA News[7], the campaign officially launched on January 6th, 2012. Shortly after the announcement of the campaign, some recalled the slogan's similarity to Switzerland's 1951 tourism slogan ("It's More Fun in Switzerland"), which led to a heated debate on the web. On that day, the hashtag #ItsMoreFunInThePhilippines[9] became a globally trending topic on Twitter and similar conversations began to surge on the social networking site Facebook, where dozens of fan pages were launched in dedication to the slogan. Soon, the official Facebook page became the hub site for the captioned images.        In 2012, The Flood Forums member Commander Santa submitted a thread about his search for a short film aired on Nickelodeon's Pinwheel show he remembered from his childhood that continued to haunt him for years to come. Commander Santa described the short as follows: Commander Santa also provided a sketch of what he remembered about the short(shown below) Initially fellow users were skeptical as Commander Santa's story felt eerily creepypasta-like, especially when compared to Candle Cove. But with Commander Santa being a highly respected member of the forums, many tried to help in any way they could. In the first 24 hours, the thread received over 800 replies and several suggestions to what the animated short could have been.      On January 8th, 2012, YouTuber magmaflower uploaded a video titled “My Video for Briona,” in which a 14-year old boy tells his girlfriend Briona how much he loves her, accompanied by the statements “stay perfect just for me” and “I love you more than there are grains of sand on every beach.” Within 10 days, the video accumulated over 1.5 million views. Hi baby girl [laughs] Everything's OK I promise. I forgive you. it's OK don't worry about it. Everythings going to be OK. I love you. I love you so much. I love you more than there are grains of sand on every beach, of every planet, of every galaxy of in the universe. And I need you in my life. I need you more than humans need water and food to survive. You mean more to me than Home Depot means to Mr. Ladrado. You mean more to me than just anything. You mean more to me than golden diamonds mean to the greediest burglar. And, you're just the most perfect most beautiful girl in all of the world, and I love you so much. I hope you enjoy watching this baby girl [kisses the air]. See you at school tomorrow baby girl. I love you. [laughs] I do, it's true. I love you more than anything else in the world [laughs]. Bye baby girl, stay perfect just for me.       In the film, the villain known as the "Joker" (played by Heath Ledger) appears at a gathering of Gotham's underground criminals. After giving a short speech about Batman, one of the criminals asks what the Joker proposes they do, to which the Joker replies, "It's simple: We, uh, kill the Batman." The Joker: A guy… like me… Look, listen. I know why you choose to have your little group therapy sessions here in broad daylight. I know why you're afraid to go out at night; the Batman. You see, Batman has shown Gotham your true colors, unfortunately. Dent, he's just the beginning. And, and as for the television's so-called plan? Batman has no jurisdiction. He'll find him, and make him squeal. I know the squealers when I see them and… [points at Lau] The Chechen: What do you propose? The Joker: It's simple: We, uh, kill the Batman.  The photograph[1] (shown on left) was originally taken by Jeffrey N. Jeffords while scuba diving in the Philippines for his site, Dive Gallery.[2] The first known image macro instance (shown on right) was posted via AdviceAnimals subreddit on January 12th, 2012. The thread[6] reached the frontpage of Reddit and the image has been viewed over 400,000 times in the first four days. Prior to becoming associated with the title "Bad Joke Eel" on Reddit, the same image was used as a punchline for the phrase "That's amore" by a commenter on FARK[3] forum on October 13th, 2009 and in an image macro on the humor site So Much Pun[4] on January 25th, 2011. The series shares similar characteristics with several image macros including Lame Pun Coon and Chemistry Cat. In September 1989, Capcom released the North American version of the NES game DuckTales[1], which is based on the Disney animated series of the same name. In the game, the player assumes the role of Scrooge McDuck, an anthropomorphic white duck that is obsessed with accumulating as much wealth as possible. The fifth stage level of the game features a background audio track called the "Moon Theme": The "Moon Theme" background music had enjoyed a cult-like status prior to its incorporation in the YTPMV genre, as evidently seen in a number of discussions threads on Reddit[2][3] and isolated instances on the GIF-sharing community YTMND.[4] The YouTube clip "Best VGM 40 – DuckTales – The Moon"[5] has gained over 690,000 views since its original upload on October 24th, 2007. A video[1] of Jefferson Bethke[8], a Washington-based spoken word artist, performing a poem he wrote[4] about the difference between religion and Jesus was uploaded to Bethke's YouTube channel[2] on January 10th, 2012. The video was posted to Reddit[7]on the 11th, where it received 839 upvotes and 421 downvotes. In five days, the video had over 12 million views, tweeted about over 86,000 times, and had over 1.4 million shares on Facebook.[5] On January 13th, the first Scumbag Jefferson Bethke[3] was posted to the Advice Animals subreddit[9], only receiving a score of 3. It also inspired several image macro series on the generator sites[10][13] with alternative names including Contradiction Guy[11] and Contradiction Chris.[12] The earliest known appearance of the photo of a Golden Retriever posing with a camera appeared on the Hong Kong Wordpress site Photoblog[6] on November 20th, 2010. On February 27th, 2011, a photoshopped version was posted by Ben Grelle (a.k.a The Frogman) to his Tumblr[1] blog with the caption "I have no idea what I'm doing." The post received over 5,000 notes in less than a year. Throughout November and December 2011, WWE aired a series of cryptic vignettes that foretold a mystery wrestler's return to the company on January 2nd, 2012[2]. Though the videos were aimed to be mysterious (containing dark images and sounds, and eerie children prophesying the end of the world), it became extremely obvious that the videos foretold the long-awaited return of Chris Jericho. As a result, wrestling fans all over the world became hyped for Jericho's return and eager to find out the story behind the mysterious vignettes. On the January 2nd, 2012 edition of WWE Raw it was confirmed that Chris Jericho was indeed the returning wrestler. That night WWE dedicated over 12 minutes of it's air time solely to Chris Jericho. In those twelve minutes, nothing happened. Jericho spent the entire segment physically hyping up the entire crowd, only to walk away without saying a single word on the microphone. This segment quickly caused a backlash from wrestling fans all over the world who complained about being denied what they wanted and expected: to hear Chris Jericho talk. Because of this reaction, many fans of Jericho who appreciated the segment began applauding his ability to cause such a huge reaction and started referring to both Jericho and the event as a "JeriTroll". Jericho has continued to consistently troll every week since his return and the further information on this can be seen further down in this entry.  The Third Annual Scream Fortress of the video game Team Fortress 2 began on October 27, 2011, and concluded at November 6, 2011 at 12am (UTC). It had announced that to celebrate the Halloween event it will include new items, weapons, costumes, and two new Achievements. One of these new patches that was included was 'The Tin Soldier" which included the following files that players could either find or buy.  On January 1st, 2011, 4chan[1] user Î£psilon Nought used the green text ">2011" to reply to a comment about the disabled children in Katawa Shoujo on the /a/ (anime) board (shown below). This song is written by Jun Ishikawa, the main composer of Kirby series. The first instance using this song on parody video remixes was one of the derivatives of Enemy Controller fad. It was uploaded to NND on November 28th, 2008.[2] “Pony”[1] was the first single released by Ginuwine on August 20, 1996. The song features a start-stop rhythm, popular in drum and bass music, with blatantly sexual lyrics. In November 2006, the song spent two weeks at the top of the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip Hop Singles chart and reached #6 on the Billboard Hot 100. The first person to record themselves dancing alone to the song was YouTuber jaystepss, who uploaded his video on May 2nd, 2006. The video went largely unnoticed with only 16,000 views as of January 2012.      The image comes from a scene in the 1971 musical Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory in which Willy Wonka, played by Gene Wilder, asks the children if they would like to see a new candy he is working on called "The Everlasting Gobstopper." On the web, Wilder's picture from the film was introduced in January 2011 through an instance of the "You Must Be New Here" reaction face. The image soon became associated with other captions, from which emerged the advice animal series "Creepy Wonka" featuring various double entendres with allusions to candies or confectioneries. The earliest known image macro (shown below, left) was submitted to Quickmeme[3] with the caption "Close the door / I'll show my my fudge packing unit" on March 2nd, 2011. It was subsequently posted to the /r/pics subreddit[6] the same day, where it was marked as spam for breaking the "no comics/macros" rule. The series was renamed "Condescending Wonka" for the first time in October 2011 after it was paired with the caption "Oh, you just graduated? / you must know everything" in an instance submitted to Quickmeme.[7] The image was posted to Reddit[8] the same day and reached the front page of the /r/pics subreddit prior to being marked as spam for breaking the "no comics/macros" rule as well.      The domain for the Hipster Hitler[2] webcomic series was registered on August 22nd, 2010. The first comic titled "Ironic Invasion"[4] featured a conversation between Hipster Hitler and the Reich Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels:  For the first time, supaguygames has found that when he sees a first spanish journal made by Sebamkfan, he typed his really evil comment, more than his head exploding. And also more than "RAEG TIME". He also put a trollface, fingering like to be a troll. And supaguygames commented "You're a crappy guy. Unwatched." And he unwatched sebamkfan without blocking him.         While the English adjective "awkward" traditionally means "socially inept, or with a lack of dexterity," its broader, colloquial usage of the word in describing simply weird or mildly uncomfortable social situations has drastically increased since the late 2000s. One of the earliest examples of awkward humor can be attributed to the advice animal series Socially Awkward Penguin, which first surfaced through places like 4chan's r9K board and MemeGenerator in June 2009. The oldest example of a text-based platform for sharing "awkward" stories can be found in the Tumblr blog ThatAwkardMoment[7], which was launched on October 23rd, 2010.      In 2009, a user on 4chan's /new/ (news) board posted the first doom paul image after he lost the 2008 republican nomination with the quote "All is lost" and "I told you so." The user said the Apocalypse was coming and that these were the last days. 4chan soon removed the /new/ board after the founder, Moot, got sick of the racism on the board. The meme vanished for awhile but was soon mirrored on 4chon.net and it's backup /new/ board. Many of the images were created there and remained. Until the founder, Moot, felt bad and recreated the /new/ board, this time dubbing it /pol/ (Politically incorrect). Soon the images were posted again on the newly created /pol/. The original scene that the image comes from takes place in American Psyco, released on April 14th, 2000.[1] In one of the scenes, Bateman uses an axe to kill one of his victims, which is where the still used in the meme comes from (shown below).[2] Although the exact first meme using the scene is unknown, a reverse image search on TinEye,[3] shows that it first appeared online February 5th, 2008, on the site Taringa[4] but has since been deleted. In memes, the earliest known variant that still exists online was posted in a Fark[5] thread by user drjekel_mrhyde on August 10th, 2009, in the form of a Demotivational Poster (shown below). The origin of the four peters is a clip from the episode "Model Misbehavior", the 10th episode in the 4th season which was first aired in 2005.[1] In this, four clones of Peter appear and are singing Mozart's "Eine Kleine Nachtmusik". The original derivative came from 4chan[1]. the original joke was that high-earning businesspeople browse imageboards in their free time.   Over time, other variations and parodies of the original version followed:   In the video, appears a kid's mocking of an old man (for example, speaking "english" when the old man ask anything to him or making faces). Finally, the old man gets angry and grab the kid. The original video was deleted, but the user MarsellusWallas on July 13th, 2007. As of August 1st, 2012 has 381880 views.    On January 8th, 2012, Redditor shakee submitted a post titled "Friendzone level 99" to the /r/funny[1] subreddit and FunnyJunk[7] containing a screenshot of a Facebook photo page depicting a teenager with a flower bouquet and the following description: This is how you do it. He comes to my house at midnight to wish me a happy birthday(: I am so blessed to have such great friends. Thank you sososoo much Jonathon! The first Quickmeme[4] submission was created the same day with the caption "Plans for weeks / humiliated for a lifetime." It was subsequently posted to Reddit[3] and reached the front page accumulating 11,328 up votes within 2 days. Catgroove was written by Austrian musician/DJ Parov Stelar, real name Marcus Füreder, regarded as the founder of the Electroswing genre[1]. It first appeared on his Coco EP, published in 2009[8]. At that time, it only received attention from his fans. On February 7, 2010, a simple video of Catgroove was uploaded to YouTube by user RobertJest1[6]. It has since received over 1.6 million views as of March 4th, 2012, and became the primary reason for the song's rise from relative obscurity.      On October 10, 2011, Youtube user MyHelmetHazStickers[2] uploaded the video "Heavy Moves Like Jagger": It was only a green screen test, but it quickly gained views. It currently has 40,000+ views.         The original image comes from a stock photo by photographer Andres Rodriguez titled "students in a library" on iStockphoto.[1] The first Quickmeme[2] submission with the caption "'You girls wanna go to a party?' / Aww that's so thoughtful of you to invite us!" was created on September 5th, 2011. One of the most comprehensive catalogs of number one songs, #1 Song on This Day in History[1] was created by Josh Hosler on December 5th, 2004. Currently, it has lists dating back to the 1890s and provides YouTube, Rhapsody and iTunes links to the songs when possible. EveryHit[5] hosts a catalog that includes celebrity birthdays in addition to the song. This Day in Music also hosts a widget[2] where users can put in their birthday and pick from US, UK, or Australian music charts. Pnm    "WaWaWa Wasuremono" is only once appeared dialog on the 10th episode in the 1st season of Haruhi's TV animation series "The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya Part 4".[1] The line, "WaWaWa Wasuremono", isn't shown on the original episode on the novel. And, Minoru Shiraishi[2], the voice actor for Taniguchi, answered in the later interview that it was his ad-lib.  Though it is unclear what YouTube comment using this syntax was posted first, it was used as early as November 18th, 2011 on the Naruto Forums[1] in a thread discussing whether or not the character Kubo believed people with naturally red hair had souls. At one point, a now-banned poster named Whirlpool replied to the thread first stating they he or she was ginger and was offended by the commentary before using the inverted syntax to make a joke.    The theory that humans hear sounds differently through each ear was pioneered by Argentinian researcher Hugo Zuccarelli[7] in the 1980s. He concluded that the brain processes sounds through reference patterns heard by each ear in order to determine which direction they are coming from.[8] He released a 15 track LP of these recordings in 1983.[16] Titled Zuccarelli Holophonic, the tracks included sounds of a shaking matchbox, a hair dryer, bees, a plastic bag, and fireworks.[13]  On January 4th, 2012, French mail-order fashion retailer La Redoute unknowingly published an advertisement[1] on its website for children's T-shirts, which featured four children modeling on a beach and a nudist man casually wading in the background of the photograph. The controversial advertisement appeared on the official website for several hours before it was noticed by several visitors and subsequently taken down by the company. The marketing oversight was further amplified by the magnifying glass tool enabling viewers to zoom in on the image for details.   In 2011, at the peak of the Brazillian Youtube Poop, the YouTube user Fablecina[1] created a autosource to increase the variery of available sources to make a YTPMV. The video compound of sounds and images destinated to other users make a YTPMV where, dressed in his blue pajamas and using some hats, Play a flute, acoustic guitar and clap your hands. The video "[source] fablecina sonoro em Dó" was uploaded on March 8th. “Well, there’s your problem” was famously uttered by Adam Savage, co-host of the science entertainment television series Mythbusters, while inspecting the engine of a cement truck in an episode that aired on February 23rd, 2005. The expression subsequently became a popular catchphrase used by the co-hosts to identify the cause of a failed experiment. On January 23rd, 2009, Glass and a Half Full Productions[7], the in-house production company for the Cadbury confectionery company, uploaded a commercial to their official YouTube channel featuring two children moving their eyebrows rapidly to the electro-funk song "Don't Stop the Rock" by Freestyle. On December 14th, 2009, The Guardian[3] published an article revealing that the commercial had been named "the public's favourite TV advert of 2009." Within 8 months, the video had accumulated over 4 million views. On December 29th, 2011, YouTuber theinternetisaweird uploaded a video of herself mimicking the Cadbury commercial eyebrow dance. In less than a week, the video accumulated over 12 million views. On November 20, 2011, Youtube user SUPERMARIOGALAXY13[1] uploaded a video titled "(Skyward Sword) Suprise Skysecks", a clip of the original scene: The next day, as well as on the 25th, he uploaded two edits of the video, titled "Legend of Molestia: Skyward Thrust" and "Legend of Property: Skyward Damage" that featured an edit of the face of Molestia (see main article for details) and the Face of Saxton Hale, respectively. Since then, several remakes have been made featuring a variety of characters.    Japan has 20 or 30 typhoons every year. Though some of them are occasionally very large scale and give a massive damage to some regions, Japanese people don't need to panic to almost all because their scale is much smaller than that in southeast asia and that of hurricane in the U.S and most of cities and people's daily life in Japan are always well prepare for natural disasters. Therefore, except for farmers and people in flood-prone areas, typhoon isn't so serious matter for Japanese people. The origin of this custom is a post in a thread on /news/ (breaking news) board in the Japanese biggest anonymous boards site 2Channel when a large scale typhoon "Pabuk"[2] came to Japan in August 2001.[3] That was by an anonymous user in Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture in August 21st. Transcript:                [researching]  The earliest known use of the word "curlbro" was posted in the "Life and Fitness" board of the United Kingdom-based Internet forum The Student Room[2] on November 11th, 2010. In the thread, forum user TheWaterfield critiqued the original poster’s workout regimen by calling him a “curlbro” for excluding leg exercises in his routine.     Jennifer Byrne (A.K.A. 1:24 girl) is the name of the girl who appeared at 1:24 in the youtube video of Susan Boyle's "Britains Got Talent" audition rolling her eyes and shown later in the video sitting down, not clapping at 5:23.She has since been cyber bullied and nicknamed "1:24 girl" due to the fact she appeared at 1 minute 24 in the video. Susan boyle audition here Though Google Translate[1] has been available since 2006, Google Translate-narrated songs did not appear on YouTube until April 2010, when German YouTuber quelllympfe[2] uploaded a Google Translate version of Eminem's 1999 hit rap single My Name Is.    "The name is: Tadá" is a meme taken from a picture of Will Smith on the Red Carpet introducing his girlfriend. It was quickly picked up by another user on 9gag and a post was made suggesting that it be vectorized into a meme. The original post suggesting a meme was submitted by 9gag user mikoaucarod on December 29, 2011. Vectorized Image The first instance reusing this song in YTPMV was "Spycraft" that was now-defunct video featuring Spy from Team Fortress2, a very popular visual resource for YTPMV. It was made by a famous YTPMV creator mexicansunflower around May 2010.[1]   On October 22nd, 2011, a post was made to 4chan claiming to be a young teenager, around the age of 14, or 15 began to brag to the people of /b/ saying things like "I have a girlfriend and you are too stupid and awkward to get one" and "At least I have a girlfriend." 4chan didn't take this too lightly and began to trash him and his pictures saying things like "At least I have a dentist." The thread continued eventually in 4chan finding his facebook, phone number, and even his home address. One commenter summed it all up nicely "One more life ruined"  Better Book Titles[1] was created by New York-based writer/comedian Dan Wilbur.[2] According to Wilbur's own description, the blog was created in order to provide succinct summaries of the book plots that “will cut through all the cryptic crap, and give you the meat of the story in one condensed image.”[1] The first post was made on July 1st, 2010[3], renaming Caleb Carr's The Alienist[15] "Teddy Roosevelt Solves Tranny Murders."  The single topic blog Awkward Stock Photos[1] was created in January 2010 by Chicago-based graphic designer Mark Hauge[5], who curated 54 WTF stock images handpicked from various stock photography websites over the course of the month.     "Novi God," which translates to "New Year" in English, was released in 2002 by Russian boy band Steklovata[1] (English: Glass wool) as a follow-up to their earlier self-titled single. The music video was originally uploaded to YouTube in early 2007, and since then, it has amassed several million views in aggregate through dozens of duplicate uploads. Being a holiday pop song, the music video continues to experience a seasonal spike in online interest every year. The original video has since been removed. Steklovata was formed in 1999 by producer Sergei Kuznechov and originally consisted of two Russian orphans, Denis Belikin and Arthur Eremeev. "Novi God" proved to be a minor hit at the time, getting seasonal airplay over Estonian radio[2].    In August 2010, Germany began testing new identification cards offering radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology to enhance security against phishing site and identity theft.[10] However, local television news reported that the cards could be easily hacked[11], a claim which was reinforced by a September 21st blog post[3] on the Chaos Computer Club.[2] The same day, German Federal Minister of the Interior Thomas de Maizière responded to these claims in a news interview with DW-TV: While not necessarily the direct progenitor of the meme, the phrase "Haters Gonna Hate" first appeared in the pop song "Playas Gon' Play" by 3LW in the year 2000: The single topic Tumblr Scanwiches[1] was launched by New York-based blogger and graphic designer Jon Chonko on February 19th, 2009. Each scanwich post typically consists of the sandwich name, a list of ingredients and a link to the restaurant, when available. Since its launch in spring of 2009, the blog has published hundreds of scanned images including readers' submissions and Chonko's own. According to a video interview with Chonko in November 2011, he began scanning sandwiches while at work: The Tumblr blog was created by Justin Valmassoi[2] on July 10th, 2011 with 35 image posts of animals ranging from piranhas to polar bears. The initial batch of posts received thousands of likes and reblogs, the most reblogged instance[3] being a photograph of several deer in a field with one placing his front leg on the hind of another.  In November 2011, "The Frogman" made a blog entry that found its way to 9gag, where it eventually reached the hot page: Wikipedia's "personal plea" banner ads were first introduced in November 2010 to promote its annual fundraising campaign[1], featuring a variety of founder Jimmy Wales' portrait images along with his personal appeal for donations. Due to its omnipresent display across the site on every article page, Wikipedia visitors began poking fun at the campaign by taking screenshots of awkward image-word associations. In addition, the slogan "Please Read: A Personal Appeal from Wikipedia Founder Jimmy Wales" was also turned into a phrasal template. When the ad campaign returned in November 2011, this time featuring portraits of other Wikipedia staff members and supporters, the awkward screenshot fad also resurged and gave way to a slew of humorous and often suggestive captioned images.       On November 28th, 1999, Season 2 Episode of Futurama titled "Brannigan, Begin Again" was broadcast, featuring a "Neutral" extraterrestrial reveals that he has "no strong feelings one way or the other." On April 14th, 2009, YouTuber leetag uploaded a clip of the scene (shown below). Over the next seven years, the video gained over 5.6 million views and 26,000 comments, while the like and dislike counts remained approximately equivalent. The humorous association of stepping on a small lego brick in barefoot with severe pain began as early as in 2007 with various parenting blog posts and discussions, as mentioned in I am Mama[4], Frugal Village[17], Huffington Post[1] and Yahoo Voice articles.[18] It has been also reported as a commonly shared experience among parents with children or in childhood memories, according to various Yahoo Answer threads.[6] The earliest known iteration of the phrase in rage comics can be found in a FFFFFUUUUUUUU rage comic posted via 4chan sometime in late 2009. According to Encyclopedia Dramatica, "cry moar" originated from the blogging website, Livejournal. It was used to taunt people who were being mocked over unpopular/dumb ideas in various roleplaying communities.[1] The term "QQ" came from the game Warcraft II. The command to leave the game was Alt + QQ, so the term "QQ" was originally used to tell people that they were unskilled at the game and should quit.[2] Over time, it started to be associated with crying because many people thought that "QQ" looked like a pair of crying eyes. Another interpretation is that "QQ" sounds like a pun on the Japanese word for ambulance (救急車, "kyukyusha"). Though, considering it's origin from Warcraft II, there is also a strong possibility that it came from the Korean word for ambulance which sounds very similar (구급차, "gyu geup cha"). This might be an explanation for QQ's association with the word Whambulance- a term that indicates that the player is butthurt and that their butthurt is either funny and/or something minor that they are overreacting to.        First developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991, HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the primary language used to describe and format information on web pages.[1] It consists of a series of tags used to represent certain types of information, which usually take the form of <tag> for opening tags and </tag> for closing tags. In the early days of Usenet, fake C pre-processor directives were used to convey the true emotions behind a post, either as an attempt at self-aware humor or to make sure sarcastic and/or trolling remarks were understood as intended: The lyric "I'm so fresh you can suck my nuts" originated from the song So Fresh by DeAndre Cortez Way, a.k.a. "Soulja Boy".[2] The song was first posted on YouTube on December 18th, 2010, by Youtuber CEOSouljaBoy.[3] On June 9th, 2011 YouTuber OniMorter[1] posted a remix of the song titled "SouljaQuest.mp3", which featured a mash-up of Souljaboy's "So Fresh" with the main tune of Brodyquest.   The text-only announcements were seen as early as 2002 on the Japanese imageboard site 2channel.[2] The oldest known image of such announcement can be traced to this instance shown below, which was initially uploaded via Japanese web in December 2003.[1] For the majority of non-Christian population in Japan and elsewhere in East Asia, Christmas is often celebrated as a secular, romantic and commercial-driven holiday. Due to its heavy association with couple-oriented events and special dates, Christmas is also regarded as a source of nuisance by those who are left without any plans for special events or romantic dates, which makes the holiday ripe for tongue-in-cheek comedy and self-deprecative humor on the web.  "I sell propane and propane accessories" Is a phrase occasionally said by Hank Hill, the main character of the animated show King of the Hill, created by Matt Judge for FOX in 1997. Hank is a propane salesman for the fictional company Strickland Propane in the fictional town of Arlen, Texas. Hank loves his job, and it is central to his identity as a person, and therefore it is featured heavily in the show.[1] The phrase itself, and specifically the redundancy of saying "propane and propane accessories," is used as a pastiche of the overbearing attitude of many salesmen and tradesmen. While Hank is not like this, he uses the phrase almost subconsciously; asked what his job is, he would invariably respond "I sell propane and propane accessories."[2]  [Researching]   The original song and the music video were produced by Neil Cicierega[1], the creator of Potter Puppet Pals and Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny.. On June 1st, 2010, Cicierega uploaded the music video to YouTube along with the description "The best day of Adrien Brody's life." The video supposedly recounts a day in the life of Adrien Brody: Brody is shown waking up early in the morning and starting his journey from his home to park. After reaching the park, he then travels to the ocean, where he is joined by starfish in his journey. Traveling past famous landmarks, Brody then reaches the far reaches of outer space, where he becomes an "intergalactic rock n' roll star," to which he uses his new-found power to create a world that revolves around his likeness. Over the next seven years, the video gained over 7.6 million views and 23,200 comments. The earliest known use of the original image was in a Blogspot[1] post where the woman is described as a "stupid hippie feminist grunge chick" on March 9th, 2007. According to the Photobucket[16] page where it was originally hosted, the photo may have been taken on October 1st, 2005. The first Quickmeme[2] submission was uploaded with the caption "'I'm against discrimination of any type' / listens to rap music with lyrics about abusing women"[3] on December 23rd, 2011. The first Nerd World Problems image macro was submitted to the /r/Funny subreddit[2] on November 2nd, 2011 using one of the black and white images associated with First World Problems, depicting a teenager seated with her back to the wall. The caption expressed the inability to make good choices in the game Starcraft. However, the post only received one upvote. A video of Giese's 1984 whistling performance on the WXYZ morning talk show Kelly & Company was first uploaded to YouTube on April 26th, 2010. The remained largely unnoticed, but on November 30th, 2011, it was re-uploaded and titled "Best Talk Show Ever" by YouTuber AndyGattis and managed to accumulate over 1 million views within 2 weeks.          This meme first appeared on the front page of FunnyJunk on December 11th, 2011 by user inbfortaken.         On July 13th, 2011, DeviantArtist peteypiranha128[4] uploaded an illustration of a frowning stick figure crouching in the shadows with the caption "You… what have you done?" (shown below). Within the first two years, the image received over 66,000 views, 1,140 downloads and 100 favorites.  The line comes from a scene in Gladiator in which the protagonist Maximus Decimus Meridius (played by Russell Crowe) defeats several enemies in a gladiator pit and dramatically exclaims “Are you not entertained?” before the audience (shown below). The quote was prominently featured in the introduction of Jay-Z's 2003 rap song "What More Can I Say." The image macro featuring the screenshot from Gladiator is believed to have originated as early as late 2007 on 4chan, with its earliest known appearance on the home design blog Home Designing[7] (shown below) on September 26th, 2009.  The Season 4, Episode 2 of "Jersey Shore" aired on August 11th, 2011. Set in Italy, the self-claimed Guidos and Guidettes travel across Italy throughout the fourth season. In the episode, a montage reel is shown of two characters Pauly D and Vinny exchanging jokes about how young of a girl's age is "too young" for them to date and sleep with.   The love story as presented in Twilight between a young girl named Bella and a vampire named Edward has been compared to other well-known novel and film love stories as early as November 2009, with a poll on SodaHead[1] asking readers to choose the best love story among Twilight, Nicholas Sparks' The Notebook and William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. In 2010, a BodyBuilding forums thread[2] compared the love stories in Harry Potter, specifically Severus Snape's unrequited love for Lily Potter, to those in Twilight. This was reemphasized in July 2011 when the Facebook group "JK Rowling Told a Better Love Story In 1 Chapter Than Meyer Did In 4 Books"[3] was created. Additionally in 2010, there was a trend in YouTube comments on music videos calling things Better than Bieber, no matter what the quality of the song was. "Connect" was originally written by songwriter Shō Watanabe, performed by J-Pop idol duo ClariS[3] and was used as the opening theme song for the anime Puella Magi Madoka Magica, which premiered in Japan on January 7th, 2011. The song was later released as the group's second single of their debut album Birthday on February 2nd, 2011. Notably, many changes were made to the opening sequence as the series went on, with fans speculating that it had to do with story-related events. However, it was revealed that most of it was due to a low animation budget on behalf of Shaft, the ambitious animation studio known for the cult hit series Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei, Bakemonogatari, and Hidamari Sketch.    The "CM Punk Is Not Impressed" meme is a moment out of a WWE storyline involving CM Punk and other WWE Talent during the Summer of 2011. The image of CM Punk being unimpressed is a screengrab from the Aug. 1, 2011 episode of WWE Monday Night Raw. While Triple H was in the ring with Punk, and trying to impress Punk with what a magnanimous businessman he is, Punk cast an aside glance at the camera to let the audience at home know that he, indeed, was not impressed. CM Punk would duplicate his "Not Impressed" look on the Jan. 30th 2012 Episode of WWE Monday Night Raw. In this case, Punk is reacting to Johny Ace extending his hand. This comes after Johnny Ace had just asked him to put the past behind him after Punk went a tirade on how Johny Ace "sucks and blow" at the same time.   The most plausible explanation for the origin of this comic is reddit's "f7u12", but research is still being done into the true beginning of this style of rage comic. Pyro Sitting Down originates from a Team Fortress 2 website comic, "True Meaning"[1]. The comic features the Engineer and Pyro, characters from the popular online game Team Fortress 2. The comic shows the Engineer reading a story reminiscent of both the Three Wise Men [2] and Santa Claus [3]. On the 2nd page [4] the Pyro is seen sitting with his hands supporting his head in a listening stance.            Footage of the giant smash originally uploaded by "AlabasterTheLorem" on November 11, 2011. It begins with Dovahkiin walking up to a giant, the giant then turns around and smashes Dovahkiin, sending him into the sky as he flails around aimlessly. This glitch was quickly picked up by Skyrim players and has now become the biggest gag in the game.             The show was produced by Taiwanese broadcasting company Formosa TV and ran from 22 December 2009 to 19 July 2011. The numbers of episodes total up to 410. The show was aired on prime time and known as the “Eight-o’clock drama”, and is very popular among older people. This drama serial is also broadcasted in other Asian countries like Singapore.        The first instance of an image macro with the name "Scumbag Christian" (below right) used an image of Buddy Christ[14], the parody religious icon from the 1999 satirical religious movie Dogma[15] , and was shared on FunnyJunk[13] on May 20th, 2011. A Scumbag Christian image macro with this background was also submitted to the Atheism subreddit[16] on August 9th, 2011. Subsequently, the name "Scumbag Christian" was used for a Quickmeme[1] page using a photo of actor Kirk Cameron.[17] The initial instance (below left) was shared on the Atheism subreddit[3] on September 11th, 2011 with the caption "Tattoos are a sin Leviticus 19:28 / has piercings." The post received more than 450 upvotes within 2 months.         The image of the frightened black cat had previously appeared in a well-known demotivational poster (shown below, left) that began circulating the web as early as 2007 with the catchphrase "What Has Been Seen Cannot Be Unseen." The earliest instance[9] of the image macro (shown below, center) on Memegenerator[1] did not contain caption playing on social distress, but instead focused on catnip. The third recorded instance[10] (shown below, right) was the first to feature a caption playing on the fears involved with filling out a standardized test. As of February 2013, there are more than 300 instances of Anxiety Cat on Memegenerator and an additional 300 on Quickmeme.[8]   On August 15th, 2010, YouTuber patc7287 uploaded a video from the 2010 PGA Championship titled "Guy yells mashed potatoes after tiger swing." The yell can be heard at :25 in the following video:         The original quote can be found in Skyrim, released November 11th, 2011, when interacting with guards after a Saadia-aligned completion of the "In My Time of Need" quest, after which a pair of mercenaries from Hammerfell will be present at or nearby the entrances to every major city in Skyrim, most noticeably in Whiterun. When the player passes a city guard while the mercenaries are present, the guard may comment on the mercs' scimitars. The often-repeated phrase was first uploaded to YouTube[1] on November 28th, 2011, by user Mucks and is the earliest known reference to the quote. The video (shown below) received over 247,000 views, 3,000 likes and 700 comments in roughly nine years. "You see those warriors from Hammerfell? They've got curved swords. Curved. Swords."  Stemming from the Advantages of Science series on Reddit, the Unimpressed Astronaut is solely centered around the 1972 photograph of NASA astronaut John Young saluting the American flag during his Apollo 16 mission[1] in 1972. Following his journey to the Moon, Young went on to command the Space Shuttle Columbia's maiden flight as well as the first Spacelab mission, STS-9, and spent 835 total hours in space. The first instance of the image macro was posted to Reddit[3] on December 1st, 2011, linking to a Quickmeme[4] page for the macro. The original caption "Oh, you spent 6 weeks abroad in Europe? That's nice." is derived from a stand-up skit by comedian Brian Regan. At the end of his monologue, he talks about how he wished he was an astronaut so when friends recount their stories, he could respond, "that's nice, I walked on the moon."  The original instance of Advantages of Science image macro originated from the Reddit category, r/atheism. On December 3rd, 2011, two images posted (“So, Jesus Walked on Water” and “So, Jesus Fed 5,000 People”) in r/atheism and received substantial upvotes, thus giving birth to the Advantages of Science.   On November 25th, 2011, Redditor randomdave posted a photo of a red-faced young man (below left) to the marijuana enthusiast r/trees subreddit titled "Being at a [10] is not always pretty."[10] The same day, the picture was submitted by redditor Ahahaha__10 with the caption "Texts the person next to them / 'I want hopsital'" (below right) in a post titled "The happened to a friend of mine on his first ever bong rip."[1] The term Senbon Zakura was first referred in the famous kabuki play Yoshitsune Senbon Zakura (Japanese: 義経千本桜), written in 1747, during the Edo period in Japan.[1] The kabuki play depicts events set in the Genpei War (1180-1185 AD) during the Heian period of Japan . The song was composed by 黒うさ (pron. kurousa) and the animation used in the original video was created by 一斗まる (pron. ittomaru). The video was uploaded in Nico Nico Douga (NND) on September 17th, 2011 and has reached more than 1.5 million views.[2] Original video with English subtitles: On June 22nd, 2010, a greentext story thread titled "Greentext When You Felt Like a Dick"[1] was posted on 4chan's /r9k/ board, a miscellaneous board based on a bot made for the webcomic xkcd's IRC channel. One user replied to the thread with a story about a fight with his or her mother on the graduation day. It is likely that the original poster meant to type “burst into tears,” but seemed to never reappear in the thread. Within five minutes of that post, other users in the thread called attention to the typo and incorporated the line into their own stories.  The source video of his fad is a TVCM for mail-order service of cosmetics, mainly for women in midlife, by the Japanese company OZIO.[3] In this video originally aired in 2005, he was standing on sandy shore (or lakeside) and shouting his love to the lady in front of TV by Japanese language. This TVCM became a topic because of two reasons. One was that it was quite rare case that South Korean actor was used in Japanese adverts in those days. And the other was his Japanese speech. The pic was posted on Deviant Art, saying "someone says 'drop dead', Commit suicide." The original image was drawn by the Pixiv artist 蒼天空 (Aosora),[2] known for his drawings featuring guro, and originally posted on July 7th, 2010 under the title "★嘔吐★" (Vomiting).[3] The original image can't longer be found on his account. From the same collection of drawings that feature Madotsuki (also removed from his account), four of them were also adopted as reaction images, without meeting the popularity of "Vomiting". The image of her taking pills usually denotes depressing subjects while the one of her going crazy usually depicts that something is either so terrible that the user can't believe it, or that something is slowly driving the user crazy.  This question was posted by Yahoo! user K.Kajunsky in July 17th, 2010.[1] When I get home, my wife always pretends to be dead. What makes it happen ? When I got home, she was lying down on the entrance. At the beginning, I was surprised. But it was continued everyday, I got used to it, and became ignoring her with saying "Hey, wake up". Then, blood was coming out of her mouth in next day. One week after, she was wearing blood-soaked shirt. I don't know if she is lately running out of ideas or getting crazy. But, one day, an arrow was piercing her head. The other day, she was putting a plastic bag on her head (it was apparently waving with her breath). She was wearing a military dress and had an honorable death in battle with holding a gun yesterday. Of course, I always go past her. What she wants me to do ? Where is she going? I haven't got a clue. Please tell me why. One day, she was fixing supper with leaving an arrow piercing her head. Additional Details I'm surprised at getting so many answers. It was probably this spring, she left a dying message "Bonito" and I could get what was supper's menu in that day. I praised her at that dinner as that was very intelligent. However, a clown (Ronald McDonald) was lying down in the next day. She easily gets carried away. It's a hard work for me to help removing her makeup. It seems she bought a millitary dress at a millitary shop. I warned her not wasting money. Then, she was ate by an crocodile of her own making today. On June 7, 2011, digital artist Adri Tibbs uploaded a comic to her main Tumblr account[1] that featured her losing the battle to get anything productive done because of Tumblr: The image picked up views on the site, and began to be reposted. An edit appeared where the "Tumblr" banner had been replaced with a gray "Internet banner", which began to appear on reddit[2], and other image sharing sites. A month later, Adri posted the comic on her DeviantART[3]. The earliest known Scumbag Brain image macro was posted to the suicide support r/suicidewatch subreddit in a thread titled "Fucking Scumbag Brain"[1] by Redditor Jackist on March 24th, 2011, received only 198 upvotes prior to being archived.  Tilt shift photography[1] traditionally refers to the use of lens movements on small and medium-format cameras to manipulate the depth of field or the focus in images. The term "tilt-shift" refers to two different types of movements: rotation of the lens plane relative to the image plane, called tilt, and movement of the lens parallel to the image plane, called shift. The original shift lens was introduced by Nikon for its 35mm SLR cameras in the mid 1960s and the full "tilt-shift" lens was introduced by Canon in 1973. The earliest known hubsite of simulated tilt-shift photographs[2] was launched by Flickr users Grahamtastic and Bluewave via group pool "Tilt Shift Fakes"[3] on February 1st, 2006. The group continued to grow in size throughout the years, gaining over 59,000 images and 19,000 members in its five years of existence. The earliest use of diorama effect in a commercial motion picture can be found in the 2006 music video for "Harrowdown Hill" by Jim L. Clark, using a process dubbed Smallgantics. The project was produced at Bent Image Lab in July 2006 and directed by filmmaker Chel White.  Cena has stated that the catchphrase and gesture was inspired by his little brother, who imitated a dance move from an unspecified video where a performer moves his head around his hands.[1] His brother dared him to do the move on television, which Cena did in the early 2000s on the WWE sub-show, Velocity. Since then, it has become a signature part of his character, and in matches, he generally does the taunt before performing one of his signature moves, the Five Knuckle Shuffle (example shown below, right).    Street Fighter is an iconic franchise of the gaming company Capcom. The first game was released in 1987. However, the game did not get it's current popularity until Street Fighter II was released for the Super Nintendo in 1991. The Street Fighter franchise has a lot of games, including the most recent Super Street Fighter 4: Arcade Edition. The first instance of this rage face can be found in the spanish page Cuánto Cabrón, infamous for the meme forcing and giving people misconception of what a meme is. The comic was posted by the user Valverde, the February 3rd, 2011. In the comic, the character searches images of the Renaissance for an exam, but founds images of boobs. The character pose can be based in the Black Eye Willy's pose, a Family Guy character: Jumanji is a fantasy-comedy film released on December 15th, 1995, starring Robin Williams playing the role of Alan: a boy who is sucked into a board game only to emerge 26 years later. After being freed from the game, he asks the two children that have freed him "what year is it?"[1] and is shocked to discover how much time has past. The image used for the caption "What year is it?" was taken from the official Jumanji movie trailer and can be seen at 1:09 in the following video: The earliest known reaction image macro instance was posted to the r/pics subreddit in a thread titled "How I feel after an afternoon nap"[2] on September 7th, 2011 by Redditor topshelf89. The thread managed to reach the front page and has accumulated 16,886 up votes as of November 30th, 2011. While it's difficult to pinpoint when the earliest examples of humanized ponies first appeared, the popularity of humanizing animal cartoon characters pre-dates the popularity of the G4 My Little Pony. A March 31, 2009 entry on Urban Dictionary uses it to define the term "Gijinka," using the Sonic and Pokemon fandoms as the most popular examples (at the time). Wikipedia and other online encyclopedias also reference a trend called "Moe anthropomorphism," in which non-human concepts are personified by a cute human character (usually female)[2]. This seems to tie in with the popularity of humanized ponies, since they serve as a human representation of the fans' love of the show and characters, and possibly the desire to bring the characters closer to reality. While many "gijinka" drawings of animal characters rely on animal design features to be recognizable (i.e. a human version of Pikachu will usually still have the original's tail and ears), with the characters of My Little Pony in particular, artists have found that they fully translate to human form easily. This is usually attributed to the original character designs' highly anthropomorphic eyes, iconic color palettes (which can be represented by colorful clothing), and especially their mane designs (which can translate very directly into human hairstyles).    On August 3rd, 2008, the joke was first introduced as a fictional board game in an infomercial parody skit from Season 3, Episode 2 of Cartoon Network's sketch comedy show Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! (shown below). The scene originated from the episode "The Gi" where The two main characters, Gumball and Darwin are watching a video of Darwin's karate, the video is called "TAE-KWON DORKS" on the internet which makes fun of them but they mistake it as a misspelling of "Tae-Kwon Do". This resulted in Gumball's mother, Nicole to unplug the computer.  Prior to the image's association with Third World Success, the image has been seen on Twitter[18] as early as June 2011 and paired with the phrase "It's Friday, Niggas"[16] as early as October 14th, 2011.[17] The First World Problems image macro series started with a BuzzFeed[13] post in March 2011 that juxtaposed stories from the First World Problems subreddit[14] with the items in question. Later that year, a Quickmeme[15] page was created featuring a stock photo of a woman crying. As of March 2012, the page has over 91,000 instances.  On May 16th 2011, Alison Coate and Olivia Campbell, two teachers from Mortlake College, Australia, created the first Facebook page for Teapotting[1] featuring themselves doing a teapot pose in various locations from the school playground to the staffroom. According to several Australian newspapers, including The Age[2], The Examiner[3] and The Herald Sun[4] that accounted for the immediate phenomenon of that particular fad, Alison Coate commented that the idea came to be following the increasing popularity of Planking and that they wanted to see if anything could become a craze by launching their own trend.     The earliest known instance of Brazzers-superimposed image was posted to FunnyJunk[2] on July 4th, 2011, featuring a photograph of the cast from the Nickelodeon sitcom iCarly. The post was well-received by other users on the site, accumulating more than 50,000 views, 2,400 up votes and 510 comments. Though the original artist of the drawing is unknown, the earliest archived use of it took place on 4chan's /a/ (Anime and Manga) image board on March 9th, 2010[1] in a thread about the latest release in the historical romance manga series A Bride's Story. In the thread, an anonymous user replied with the reaction image, though not yet referred to as “amazed face,” to convey excitement in seeing his or her favorite character on the title page. The game show contestant, Tyrone Rogers from Maryland, appeared on Season 25, Episode #5727[1] of Jeopardy! which aired on June 30th, 2009: The original instance of "Shit Tyrone, Get It Together" image macro was reportedly posted on 4chan, according to various accounts on Tumblr.[2] The image was reblogged by humor sites Monorail[3] and Funny Junk[4] on September 13th, 2009 and later picked up via Stumbleupon.[5] The base photo was used to advertise jeans sold at retailers JCPenny and later, K-Mart[12][13], some time previous to May 2009.[1] The stock image was used again in May 2011 in an article on Cougar Life Review.[3] Soon after this post, the first instance of the image macro was created on QuickMeme[2] in early July 2011.  One of the earliest archived appearances of Cuteness Overload was posted to the /r/Pics subreddit[1] on September 23rd, 2011 as a response to a photo of a dog appearing to drink out of a straw with the caption "i'mma just take a sip okay?" Before it was archive, it received more than 8,100 upvotes and 803 points overall.   In 1994, Canadian writer and body modification enthusiast Shannon Larratt launched BME as a webzine.[1] The website became one of the internet's premiere sources for piercing, tattoos and other body modification. The exact date of the first Pain Olympics is disputed, but it likely took place in either 2002 or 2003. While some claim the first Pain Olympics took place in 2002,[5] BME's website wiki says that the company held its first "BMEfest 2003," in Tweed, Ontario, Canada, where the first Pain Olympics took place. [2] Some of the events included drinking hot sauce, forehead pulling, and seeing how much weight one can carry on a suspension. The even would be an annual one, until 2008.[3] On September 24th, 2004, the website painolympics.com[4] launched, hosting the video "BME Pain Olympics III." The original full phrase "Our men are running from the battlefield! Shameful display!" is said by your virtual advisor in the game Total War: Shogun 2, released March 15th, 2011, whenever one of your units loses their morale and routs from the battlefield. The first reference to this was uploaded by YouTuber[4] DinhLilium on March 20th, 2011, receiving over 329,000 views, 2,600 likes and 260 comments in roughly 10 years (shown below). Since the probability of at least one unit routing every battle was extremely high, players were likely to hear this phrase at least once a match and the announcer's heavy Japanese accent further fueled the phrase into becoming a meme. The most likely origin point for this phrase is the /v/ forums of 4chan. The first instance of the "shamefur dispray" version comes from a post on March 16th, 2011, when a /v/ board user commented in a Shogun 2 general thread and mocked the difficulty that the original poster was playing in the game (seen below).[1] The colloquial usage of "must be new here" has been noted in popular films and TV comedy series for many years, with the earliest mentions found in an episode of the 1967 British TV series The Prisoner and more recently in an episode of the FOX sitcom series "Titus"[3] that aired in 2000. On the web, the phrase has been used in the comments of numerous blogs and news sites as a response to stereotypical newbie questions or as the title of forum threads addressed to the newcomers, as seen in a Badminton Central forum thread[11] in October 2002 and a Geek Culture forum thread[12] in July 2004. The earliest definition of "five-ever"[2] was submitted to Urban Dictionary in April 2006. A second entry for its shorthand “5 ever”[1] was submitted in August 2010. Its earliest known use as the superlative of "4ever" was introduced in a copypasta image resembling a handwritten note posted by Tumblr user Deathray-Deathray[13] on March 10th, 2011. The image contained a short teenage romance story written in Comic Sans with a side note encouraging readers to reblog or like if they “crey.” The post quickly spread on Tumblr and gained nearly 44,000 likes and reblogs as of May 2012. The same day, this image was reshared on a Threadless user profile page[18] where it received more than 80 comments.    These are Logo Parodies of Klasky Csupo that've been popular from 2010 and nowadays. The main parodies are made in Paint and Windows Movie Maker due to effects and transitions looks like the actual Logo. The main parodies is from the classic "Robot" Logo:  In 2011, Dreamworks released a spinoff/prequel to their popular Shrek franchise, starring Puss in Boots. In the beginning of the movie, there is a scene in an all-cat bar (serving milk), with the titular character talking to someone else. Every time something with… implications is being said, a nameless cat puts a paw to the mouth and makes the "Oooooh… " sound (as if to say "oh-oh…"). The cat appears again after the credits. While it is difficult to pinpoint the precise origin of the phrase due to the common nature of the words, its usage in the context of online media most likely dates back to sometime in the early 2000s when the term "gay" was commonly used as a synonym for "lame," a once-popular colloquialism that has since become stigmatized due to its homophobic connotation. On June 14th, 2008, Urban Dictionary user MonkSEALPup submitted the earliest known entry[1] for the phrase, which attributes its coinage to commenters on the Internet humor site Break. Something that is both fake and gay. Popularized by Break.com. In late February 2010, Break uploaded a comedy skit as a tribute to the community's long-running comment joke (the video has since been removed).  The meme originated from a Facebook group when a member posted a picture of himself wearing a hat and a pair of sunglasses. Another member captioned the picture with the words "Just Hat Sexy." Soon, many members of the group began to insert humorous text, often relating to hats, onto the picture. One of the members Photoshopped the head from the picture and created an Advice Animal with a colorful background. This became the standard template for The Hat Guy.   This is the most popular and most viewed Office Rage video. This video is a compilation of alot of different Office Rage videos. The Unamused face originated in a forum post on Nasioc.com, when a user asked for an Unamused face to be posted in the responses. Users posted a vast majority of faces that they thought brought out the unamused feeling of one's self, but one user posted the unamused that we all know today as Unamused face. Other users kept posting the same face but with their own touches to the face such as Gentlemen Unamused, A unamused wearing a sombrero and many more.           On November 21st, 2011, Megyn Kelly appeared on Bill O’Reilly’s Fox News talk show The O’Reilly Factor to discuss the pepper spray incident that unfolded during an Occupy protest at the University of California Davis. In discussing the medical effects of pepper spray, Kelly described the volatile substance as a “food product.” Shortly after it aired, a YouTube version of the interview was shared on Gawker.[2] The first image macro created from Kelly's appearance was posted to Reddit[7] on November 22nd, 2011 and was captioned with "Pepper spray? / it's a food product, essentially."    On November 21st, 2011, Redditor seangp posted a video to the marijuana enthusiast r/trees subreddit titled "FENTON YOU LITTLE SHIT!"[1]. The thread received managed to reach the front page and received over 7,000 up votes in 24 hours. The phrase “you don’t say” is an idiomatic expression used to convey surprise or astonishment but it can be also used sarcastically in response to an obvious statement.[8] The image of Nicolas Cage was taken from a scene in the 1988 black comedy film Vampire's Kiss, which revolves around a troubled literary agent's descent into madness after convincing himself that he is turning into a vampire. His unique facial expression was taken from a particular scene in which Cage's character Peter Loew torments his secretary in a disturbing manner. The scene from Vampire Kiss was featured in a video titled "Nicholas Cage Freaking Out," uploaded by YouTuber twoworldsfreak01 on July 27th, 2009. A still from the scene was also used as a reaction face in a in a demotivational image captioned with "Nicolas Cage / Available in Stoic and Batshit Crazy" uploaded to Roflrazzi[13] on August 15th, 2009. The contour drawing of Nicolas Cage first appeared in a rage comic uploaded to Reddit[1] by user LeechHax on October 1st, 2011. It had been vectorized by Redditor Aveilleux[10] for LeechHax to use specifically in his comic.      On November 18th, 2011, a group of students at the University of California Davis gathered on campus for an Occupy protest, during which they formed a human chain by linking their arms together. When they refused to comply with the police request to leave, UC Davis Police officer Lieutenant John Pike and another officer walked across the the group, administering orange pepper spray straight down the line of unmoving students.[17] A photo of Lieutenant John Pike pepper spraying seated students at the UC Davis protest was taken by Louise Macabitas and posted to Reddit[1] on November 19th, 2011. Two photoshopped versions of Macabitas' photo surfaced on Reddit on November 20th. The first image[2] featured Strutting Leo photoshopped over Lt. Pike. The second[3] removed Lt. Pike, placing him in the 1819 painting Declaration of Independence by John Trumbull.[4] The same afternoon, Lt. Pike was placed in Georges Seurat's A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte[5] (1884) by Tumblr blog It Makes No Sense[6] where it received over 2400 notes in a day.       In 2010, restuarant chain "Jack in The Box" released a commericial where a chef tries to eat a slice of pancake. The costumed mascot next to him does not want him to eat the pancake, as it resembles his face. The term was derived from the word 和諧 (meaning “harmony”, Pinyin: hé xié). During the Hu-Wen reign, the construction of a harmonious society[1] was emphasized in government propagandas and policies. To build that harmonious society, which has no struggle between anyone, the Chinese government has put huge effort on censorships in order to stabilize the Communist Party of China’s regime. Since then, the Chinese netizens started to call the censorship 河蟹 (literally meaning river crab) as a verb, just because 和諧 and 河蟹 have similar pronunciations (See their pinyins). The usage of the word is not limited on describing censorship on the Internet, but also IRL arrests of the anti-government people.   On December 11th, 2008, New York Magazine's Vulture Blog[3] published a slideshow titled “Vulture’s Complete Field Guide to the Facial Expressions of Keanu Reeves” that consisted of screen captures of Reeves from various films. The 22nd slide featured an image of Ted (played by Keanu Reeves) taken from the 1989 comedy film Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure in a scene where Ted is being chased by medieval knights. The image was subsequently used as a reaction face with the earliest known instance occurring on the Fark[1] forums (shown left) on September 17th, 2010. The first image macro (shown right) was posted to the r/funny subreddit[2] with the caption “What if we CAN breathe in space / and they just don’t want us to escape” on June 2nd, 2011, which accumulated 6,847 up votes prior to being archived.    This music medley including 26 popular tracks in YTPMVs was crated by a YouTube/Nico Nico Douga user Reourom, and first posted to YouTube on January 4th, 2011.[1] Though this first video was deleted in that year, several reprints were soon uploaded again by other users, and Reourom himself also reuploaded it. Via: KumikyokuWiki[2] According to BuzzFeed, [1] the earliest available depiction of the image comes from a racist and antisemitic cartoon, drawn by an artist using the pseudonym A. Wyatt Mann, who allege to be cartoonist Nick Bougas. The cartoon compares the character who later be known as "the Happy Merchant" and a racist depiction of a Black man to cockroaches and rats (shown below). However, the earliest available version of the image comes from the white supremacy and neo Nazi website JRBooksOline, in a post about a conspiracy theory regarding ritualistic murders committed by Jews. Posted in February 2001, the image features the caption, "Hymie showing his real side" (shown below).  During the 2nd quarter of 2011, YouTube increased the video limit for 15 minutes. However, they kept it secret as well that any YouTube account made after that day and before it (if those accounts that have a clean record) have the capacity as well and rights to upload videos up to 10 hrs. Though obviously those accounts who would obtain a strike/warning would lose the capacity to upload 10 hrs, and may only upload up to 15 minutes.  On November 15th, 2011, a Facebook[6] fan page was created that encouraged male teens to post pictures of themselves holding a hat over their genitals. The page was launched by a group of 15 year olds in Dalby Queensland as a joke amongst their circles, but it quickly gained more than 10,000 followers, according to the local news site NineMSN.[10]  The original book was written and illustrated by Jon Klassen[1] and published on September 27th, 2011.[2] Tumblr user thesulfurandthesigh initially posted a series of images of the book's pages some time in early November, which accumulated over 37,000 notes in a few weeks.[3] The post has since been deleted but the images were archived on Buzzfeed[7] and FunnyJunk.[14] The first parody of the book was posted as a part of a reblog of original post by modestmango[3] on November 13th, 2011. It was Team Fortress 2 themed, illustrating the story of a Heavy looking for his party hat. The next day, afuturegentleman[4] posted a version in which Professor Layton from the Nintendo DS game series of the same name is looking for his top hat.         The discussion about the power ranking of characters in the Type-Moon world (Fate/Stay Night and Tsukihime) had already begun when the first “Fate” game was released in 2004. These topics were mostly discussed on the Type-Moon board in Shitaraba BBS. The discussion consisted of comparing the power of characters in Type-Moon world with other skills in other manga/anime series (eg. Stands in JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure, Nen in HUNTER x HUNTER). In order to avoid antis and trolls in 2ch, many of threads for the discussion about Type-Moon’s works have continued in Shitaraba since around 2003. The oldest thread specialized for the ranking was posted on March 1st, 2004. 【最強は】型月世界ランキング【だれだ！！】. As of now, the latest thread for this series is number 440. However, what really sparked the controversy was a Tsukihime and Fate/Stay Night crossover doujin series called Type-Moon Complex X created by Crazy Clover Club in 2007.[2] In the doujin, several Tsukihime characters defeat Fate/Stay Night characters. Shiki defeats the Servant Berserker which caused a lot of fans to rage and discuss the topic seriously.[3] Though Tsukihime is far more popular in Japan than here. This meme is used primarily on 4chan's /a/ and /jp/ boards (though it makes appearances in other forums as well in Type-Moon topics). It's variations also primarily came from 4chan.     The answer to every question in the universe came from the 1997 comedy film, Bean, specifically, at the part where Bean throws a jelly bean high in the air and proceeds to catch it with his mouth. This is followed by a question from the curator's son about how he does it. He just says "Magic", quickly followed with a couple of snorts.  The original image of the sneering face was created by DeviantArt user 3-Angled-Blue in 2008, during an internal raid of the 4chan board /b/ by users of the boards /v/ and /trv/. 3-Angled Blue then posted the image to DeviantArt, where it has received over 70 comments since 2008.[1]   On February 16th, 2010, FunnyJunk user KingGawjuss posted a MS Paint comic titled "Principal Creepy"[6] with the "now kiss" image in the bottom panel. In the post, KingGawjuss claims to have drawn the comic himself.  According to Wikipedia[1], the first known Droste effect image was a triptych from 1320 by Italian artist Giotto di Bondone called the "Stefaneschi Altarpiece." In the painting, the Cardinal Giacomo Gaetani Stefaneschi is holding the exact same painting he is featured in. The name for the technique originates in 1904 from the cover art for the Dutch Droste cocoa powder that featured a nurse holding a serving tray with the same box of cocoa powder on the tray. Droste effect animated GIFs can be made to loop so that it appears to be infinitely zooming in on the image. One of the earliest known Droste effect GIF fads was inspired by an image called "Fractal Grandma" that featured a woman in a blue shirt wearing a duplicate of herself on her hand. The first known posting of the image comes from a post on the image site Moonbuggy[2], that was cached by Google on November 7th, 2007. A YTMND page using the same image titled “Recursive Grandmother”[3] was created on May 6th, 2008. On September 3rd, 2009, an edited version with Gary Busey’s head was posted to YTMND.[4] The song was from Kitsune² digital album 8AM[1] released on December 8th, 2009, and was also published on Renard Queenston's YouTube channel in the same day.  "Fus Ro Dah" are the words for the "unrelenting force"[2] thu'um shout in the game Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. After reaching the first town of Whiterun, the player must defeat a dragon that poses a threat to the town. Once the dragon has been killed, the player absorbs its soul and discovers he is a rare chosen hero known as a "Dragon-Born" who is blessed with the ability to perform various powerful shouts. "Fus" is the first shout the player learns of the 24 that can be discovered in the game. It fires a shock-wave of force energy that stuns and pushes enemies. After visiting the Gray Beards at High Hrothgar, the player learns the more powerful shout "Fus Ro Dah" that can be translated as "force balance push." An Urban Dictionary[8] definition was created on August 23rd, 2011. The earliest known parody video was uploaded to YouTube by user atatadadada on September 15th, 2011, nearly one month prior to release of the game. It used footage from the official trailer paired with a FAIL video of a woman falling off a chair. Some of the more insightful comics about /v/ are drawn by a Deviant Art user, ~3-angled-blue. One of his most exploitable comics is a 3-panel comic showing how heated arguments are made in September 2008.[1] He proceeds to post most, if not all, of his comics on Deviant art. More than a year later, username SantanaDVX of the Strongside of Facepunch Studio Boards redrew a new exploitable comic which, while it shares the same idea, ends with all the infuriated people chasing the troll instead of arguing among themselves.[2] The video was uploaded via YouTube[2] and Reddit[1] on November 16th, 2011 by user Stardestroyer65, who shot the 8 second video of his daughter playing with a toy car. The video immediately gained viral momentum on Reddit, reaching the frontpage within just hours of upload. Within two days, the YouTube video had over 1 million views.   On May 20th, 2011, the earliest known instance of the multi-pane comic strip was featured on the Tumblr humor blog The Sochill Network,[1] though the watermark indicates that it had been previously submitted to 9gag.      As previously stated, this beard was first shown in Gears of War 3. There is a thread on EPIC Games Forums[1] with images of just about anything with Dom's Beard on it. Ranging from game characters, real-life people, and even places.        The original image of Scottish actor David Tennant was taken on the set of the British science fiction television show Doctor Who, in which Tennant stars as the tenth protagonist of the series. While the identity of the photographer or its date remains unknown, the image began circulating online as early as September of 2009.[4] The photo continued to spread on sites like Uniblog[5], SodaHead[6] and Unification.[7] On November 30th, 2010, the first photoshopped version was uploaded by Tumblr user invisibleduck[1] and subsequently reposted on the single-topic Tumblr TennantFace.[2] In the first three years, the TennantFace blog featured over 800 posts. The eroge visual novel Itadaki Jan-Gari-an R was created by Studio Miris and was released in Japan on August 5th, 2005, and with it's theme song "Love Cheat!" being performed by Mosaic.wav, a danpa band who also performed the theme for Figu@Mate, which also gained popularity on Niconico during 2007. The visual novel is acclaimed for its opening credit sequence; created by the Japanese animator URA[3], it is regarded among Japanese Otakus as one of the few masterpieces in terms of motion graphics in promotional videos for eroge visual novels.   The original photoshopped sweaters were created by New York City design student Alex Gibson (Tumblr handle: BadSmellingBoy) on February 16th, 2011. Gibson initially posted fifteen different images on both sweaters and tee shirts and experimented with several different base images.   The outline drawing was based on a still image from an interview with Tyson by the online knowledge forum Big Think[4] on living and longevity (shown below), which was uploaded to YouTube on June 3rd, 2011. The non-plussed reaction occurred when Tyson explained how Sir Isaac Newton invented calculus before his 26th birthday. An animated GIF of the reaction was submitted to the marijuana enthusiast r/trees[5] subreddit in a post titled "when asked if i smoke weed often" on August 25th, 2011 (shown below, left). User Hippopoptimus_Prime replied to the thread with a rage comic version of the face (shown below, right). The visual novel Nursery Rhyme was created by the developer company Lump of Sugar,[2] and released in Japan on November 25th, 2005. Its theme song "True My Heart" was originally arranged by the Japanese group ave;new and was sung by Saori Sakura. The opening was originally uploaded to NND in February 2007, during the site's beta release and hadn't been denied access from YouTube, and its misheard phrase was already garnering attention with early adopters of NND at that time. It's notoriety was given because during the end of the song's opening chorus, the Japanese word "dakishime" (Eng: embrace, to hold) can be heard as da "Kishimen," which is one of the varieties of Udon, a type of Japanese noodles.[3] On November 7th, 2011, Redditor natedern[7] submitted a link to an AT&T commercial titled "Hi Reddit. After three years of auditioning, I booked my first commercial. I say "Huh?" in this AT&T spot. Just wanted to share."[1] The thread quickly reached the front page of Reddit and accumulated over 31,000 upvotes and 2,800 comments in the first 24 hours. The commercial video gained more than 500,000 views in the first 72 hours of upload on YouTube. Manager: "Matt, ignore me and continue updating your fantasy team." Matt: "Huh?" The original image comes from a stock photo found on Photos.com[2] titled "Young Man Drinking Beer At Outdoor Pub" (shown left). The first instance of the series surfaced on November 7th, 2011, when Redditor ikfotsur submitted an image macro titled "Lazy college senior"[3] with the caption "5 minutes late to class / skip entire day" (shown right). The post reached the front page of the r/adviceanimals subreddit, accumulating 9,602 up vote and 510 comments prior to being archived. The picture is rumored to have been taken at the Highlander Pub in Ottawa, Canada. In March of 2012, Redditor Areean submitted a Google Street View screenshot[19] of the location, noting that the outdoor chairs and tables at the pub matches those seen in the stock photo.  On December 19th, 2007, animator Arin Hanson, also known as Egoraptor, published the video "Awesome Compilation Volume 6."[6] When posted to Newgrounds [7] that day, the video received more than 2.6 million views in less than 13 years. Three years later, Hanson published an isolated version of the clip on YouTube, where it received more than 2 million views in less than 10 years (shown below).        Pictures about "Regular youth, romantic youth, and stupid youth" The song was first released as an entry for the 6th "BMS of Fighters" that was an online BMS competition festival held on the Japanese web from late September to early October in 2009.[3] The background animation (BGA) for this BMS was created by a Japanese creator called Cube3. This BMS got much popularity among viewers/players, and got the 1st rank in an individual category in that competition. In addition to this, its longer version "DRAGONLADY (SUPER FIRE PROWREST REMIX)" was also released in a free web compilation album series for that festival "BOF2009 COMPILATION ALBUM" from Groundbreaking.[4]   The Awkward Silence Guy was created by Ian Collier in an attempt to show all of the awkward situations that could happen in life. The video below shows the face at about 2:16. The video in question (Embedding is not currently working, this link will be changed back once the issue is fixed) @Horse_ebooks[1] is the companion Twitter account for Horse-Ebooks.com[2], an ebook store that is part of the e-Library Network.[3] The network hosts between 170 and 197 other ebook sites with similar Twitter accounts. Owned by Alexei Kuznetzsov, the Horse eBooks site was registered on November 26th, 2009 and the Twitter handle was registered on August 5th, 2010. One of the earliest documented and shared tweets was made on February 6th, 2011 (shown below). How to Teach a Horse to Sit, Give a Kiss and Give a Hug As of October 2012, the account has made 16,148 tweets and has more than 120,000 followers. The account is known for interspersing spam links with phrases from the books, receiving hundreds of retweets and favorites for many of its fragmented messages.[6] On 01 Nov 2011, a article on a Singaporean online news website The Straits Times Online Mobile Print (STOMP) appeared with the title: "Pai kia (Badly brought up) girls on rise in S'pore: One boasts that she slapped mum." It was written by the author that he/she witness "One 14-year-old girl even bragged on facebook about slapping her mother."[1] Trio comes from youtube, from account named "210719" which posted videos on youtube on 9th of february, 2006 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_o47Gs6DQ0 The original animation was created by Niconico user mogumoguhuyoudo (モグモグフヨード) and was shared to the site on July 12th, 2008.[1] Titled "Touhou Boss Rush", the video featured many of the female characters from the bullet-hell shooter Touhou Project dancing and acting out the lyrics to "Communication Break Dance", a 2002 rock song performed by the Japanese rock group SUPER BUTTER DOG.[2] The Heart Sutra (Chinese: 般若波羅蜜多心經 / Japanese: 般若心経 / Romanized: Hanya Shingyou) is part of the “Perfection of Wisdom” group of Mahāyāna Buddhist scriptures and contains the famous paradox phrase “form is emptiness; emptiness is form.” Frequently chanted before and/or after a meditation sitting, it is often considered one of the most well known scriptures in Buddhist literature.[1] The remixing fad began on September 3rd, 2011 when NND user and Vocaloid artist Onew-P (おにゅうP) posted a video titled "Pop heart Sutra" featuring Hatsune Miku[2]. OWnew-P's upload has accumulated over 1 million views as of November 16th, 2011.  In March 2008, Something Awful hosted a Photoshop Phriday contest[1] where users altered images from a July 2006 Fashion SWAT post[2] highlighting some of the worst outfit and posterboard combination from science fairs. There were eight pages of contributions (examples below).   In "Soldier Thinks he is a Robot", one of Rubberfruits videos before his permanent departure from Youtube, The Soldier and Heavy from Team Fortress 2 appear, like most of his other popular videos involving the characters. During the course of the Video, The Soldier thinks he is a Robot and utters sound effects that are often used by Futuristic Retro Sci-Fi Robots, which also contains some of his Old Voice Commands ("Beep Boop", "Beep Boop Son, Beep Boop", ETC). He later says that a RED Dispenser nearby is a Ghost, which leads to the Soldier crushing the Heavy's Head. The Dispenser turns on, but instead of the Gauge to show how much power it has before refill, a"dancing Spy" is seen, with his arms crossed together and randomly dances to the music sample mentioned above in a physcedelic backround. The Dispenser is then Hurled into The Soldier after 27 seconds in, and he is turned into a gib of his foot               The trope of anthropomorphizing domesticated pets has been seen prior to this series, most notably with LOLcat image macros in 2005, Dogfort comics in 2010 and "I Have No Idea What I'm Doing" images in 2011. The earliest known instance of the image macro featuring the caption "Yes, This is Dog" was posted by Tumblr blogger VivaDixies[8] on October 2nd, 2011. The photograph of the black Labrador originated from the 1984 Serbian film Pejzaži u magli ("Foggy Landscapes"), directed by Serbian director Jovan Jovanović.[7][10] The scene is shown at 2:15 in the film: On July 15th, 2005, the Seattle Times[1] reported that an investigation into the owners of an Enumclaw farm was under investigation, following the July 2nd death of a man from "to acute peritonitis [that resulted from the] perforation of the sigmoid colon during anal intercourse with a horse."[2][3] Because bestiality was not illegal in Washinton state and the horse was not injured, police did not "believe a crime occurred." The farm was the subject of conversation on numerous internet chat rooms as a "destination for people looking to have sex with livestock." Investigators found hundreds of hours of videotape of men having sex with horses on the farm.  The Rake originated on 4chan's /b/ board in late 2005. An anonymous poster started a thread with the post "hey /b/ lets make a new monster". Naturally, there were many ideas, but one stood out, and another poster created a new thread based on this idea. The thread started with this post: Alright, this is for the people who like the three-eyes, no apparent mouth, pale skin one. Here's what we've got so far: Humanoid, about six feet tall when standing, but usually crouches and walks on all fours. It has very pale skin. The face is blank. As in, no nose, no mouth. However, it has three solid green eyes, one in the middle of its forehead, and the other two on either side of its head, towards the back. Usually seen in front yards in suburban areas. Usually just watches the observer, but will stand up and attack if approached. When it attacks, a mouth opens up, as if a hinged skull that opens at the chin. Reveals many tiny, but dull teeth. This eventually formed into what we now know as "The Rake". The Rake went through many design and name changes during its beginning. One of the more prevalent names was "Operation Crawler". Below are a couple of the "checkpoints" from the thread where it originated. 6 feet tall is good humanoid pale greyish skin 2 large eyes on the front of the head because of trips >>14832777 and nature no nose mouth that is slightly visable, then opens on a hinge hundreds of dull but not blunt teeth eats meat genitals dont matter because no interviews really talk about that seen in suburban areas minding its own business attacks when approched but mostly just stares at people looks human enough to be able to disguise with fedora and trench coat or similar revised again, Approximately 6' tall, but seen crouching Humanoid Pale, greyish skin 2 slightly larger than human eyes No nose Mouth that is smaller than human, but when provoked or attacked, opens freely on a hinge down to the neckline, showing hundreds of dull, but not blunt teeth Unknown origin Unknown Diet Seen in suburban areas Opens it's mouth and widens its eyes when provoked, attacks when approached If not provoked or approached, just stares One of the earliest appearances of the story was posted to the personal blog[1] of Something Awful user Brian Somerville[15] on July 20th, 2006. It was the first story in a series entitled "Horror Theater," but Somerville does not indicate if the text was taken from another website or if it was written specifically for that blog post. According to the mythology, firsthand accounts of The Rake has been described as early as in the 12th century and documented for the first time in 1691. The story also alleges that strange events in the northeastern U.S. involving the creature led to brief local media interest in the summer of 2003, but most written accounts of the creature have been mysteriously destroyed since. Primarily focused in rural New York state, self proclaimed witnesses told stories of their encounters with a creature of unknown origin. Emotions ranged from extremely traumatic levels of fright and discomfort, to an almost childlike sense of playfulness and curiosity. While their published versions are no longer on record, the memories remained powerful. Several of the involved parties began looking for answers that year. In early 2006, the collaboration had accumulated nearly two dozen documents dating between the 12th century and present day, spanning 4 continents. In almost all cases, the stories were identical. I’ve been in contact with a member of this group and was able to get some excerpts from their upcoming book. The Rake A Suicide Note: 1964 As I prepare to take my life, I feel it necessary to assuage any guilt or pain I have introduced through this act. It is not the fault of anyone other than him. For once I awoke and felt his presence. And once I awoke and saw his form. Once again I awoke and heard his voice, and looked into his eyes. I cannot sleep without fear of what I might next awake to experience. I cannot ever wake. Goodbye. Found in the same wooden box were two empty envelopes addressed to William and Rose, and one loose personal letter with no envelope. Dearest Linnie, I have prayed for you. He spoke your name. A Journal Entry (translated from Spanish): 1880 I have experience the greatest terror. I have experienced the greatest terror. I have experienced the greatest terror. I see his eyes when I close mine. They are hollow. Black. They saw me and pierced me. His wet hand. I will not sleep. His voice (unintelligible text). A Mariner’s Log: 1691 He came to me in my sleep. From the foot of my bed I felt a sensation. He took everything. We must return to England. We shall not return here again at the request of the Rake. From a Witness: 2006 Three years ago, I had just returned from a trip from Niagara Falls with my family for the 4th of July. We were all very exhausted after a long day of driving, so my husband and I put the kids right to bed and called it a night. At about 4am, I woke up thinking my husband had gotten up to use the restroom. I used the moment to steal back the sheets, only to wake him in the process. I appologized and told him I though he got out of bed. When he turned to face me, he gasped and pulled his feet up from the end of the bed so quickly his knee almost knocked me out of the bed. He then grabbed me and said nothing. After adjusting to the dark for a half second, I was able to see what caused the strange reaction. At the foot of the bed, sitting and facing away from us, there was what appeared to be a naked man, or a large hairless dog of some sort. It’s body position was disturbing and unnatural, as if it had been hit by a car or something. For some reason, I was not instantly frightened by it, but more concerned as to its condition. At this point I was somewhat under the assumption that we were supposed to help him. My husband was peering over his arm and knee, tucked into the fetal position, occasionally glancing at me before returning to the creature. In a flurry of motion, the creature scrambled around the side of the bed, and then crawled quickly in a flailing sort of motion right along the bed until it was less than a foot from my husband’s face. The creature was completely silent for about 30 seconds (or probably closer to 5, it just seemed like a while) just looking at my husband. The creature then placed its hand on his knee and ran into the hallway, leading to the kids’ rooms. I screamed and ran for the lightswitch, planning to stop him before he hurt my children. When I got to the hallway, the light from the bedroom was enough to see it crouching and hunched over about 20 feet away. He turned around and looked directly at me, covered in blood. I flipped the switch on the wall and saw my daughter Clara. The creature ran down the stairs while my husband and I rushed to help our daughter. She was very badly injured and spoke only once more in her short life. She said “he is the Rake”. My husband drove his car into a lake that night, while rushing our daughter to the hospital. He did not survive. Being a small town, news got around pretty quickly. The police were helpful at first, and the local newspaper took a lot of interest as well. However, the story was never published and the local television news never followed up either. For several months, my son Justin and I stayed in a hotel near my parent’s house. After we decided to return home, I began looking for answers myself. I eventually located a man in the next town over who had a similar story. We got in contact and began talking about our experiences. He knew of two other people in New York who had seen the creature we now referred to as the Rake. It took the four of us about two solid years of hunting on the internet and writing letters to come up with a small collection of what we believe to be accounts of the Rake. None of them gave any details, history or follow up. One journal had an entry involving the creature in its first 3 pages, and never mentioned it again. A ship’s log explained nothing of the encounter, saying only that they were told to leave by the Rake. That was the last entry in the log. There were, however, many instances where the creature’s visit was one of a series of visits with the same person. Multiple people also mentioned being spoken to, my daughter included. This led us to wonder if the Rake had visited any of us before our last encounter. I set up a digital recorder near my bed and left it running all night, every night, for two weeks. I would tediously scan through the sounds of me rolling around in my bed each day when I woke up. By the end of the second week, I was quite used to the occasional sound of sleep while blurring through the recording at 8 times the normal speed. (This still took almost an hour every day) On the first day of the third week, I thought I heard something different. What I found was a shrill voice. It was the Rake. I can’t listen to it long enough to even begin to transcribe it. I haven’t let anyone listen to it yet. All I know is that I’ve heard it before, and I now believe that it spoke when it was sitting in front of my husband. I don’t remember hearing anything at the time, but for some reason, the voice on the recorder immediately brings me back to that moment. The thoughts that must have gone through my daughter’s head make me very upset. I have not seen the Rake since he ruined my life, but I know that he has been in my room while I slept. I know and fear that one night I’ll wake up to see him staring at me. While the original thread was not archived, the comic was first posted to 4chan's /v/ (video game) board circa October 31st, 2010. This version features a child dressed as the Super Mario Brothers character, Luigi who says "Boing!" on exiting. The comic and a template was reposted to several other 4chan boards including /co/ (comic books) on the same day.[1] The next day, two additional threads[2][3] were archived from /v/. The exact origin of the creepypasta is unknown. Encyclopedia Dramatica[1] cites the origin as the /x/ (paranormal) board on 7chan, while the online fiction wiki PPC Wikia[2] lists the /x/ (paranormal) and /b/ (random) boards on 4chan as the possible point of origin. The earliest archived post on 4chanarchive featuring a Holders story was submitted to the /b/ board on January 1st, 2007. The drawing was created for use on the forums of Cheat Engine, an open source game modifier. Chris Farral, better known by his handle Up2Admin[1], shared the first production of the image on August 10th, 2010[2] in the site's art sub-forum after having finished it. One of the earliest comics utilizing the face was shared on Memebase[4] on December 5th, 2010.   The widespread word "Pantsu" had possibly been derived from the word Panchira (パンチラ, "glimpse" of panty). The rise of underwear fashion most likely came from legendary white dress photos of Marilyn Monroe during early cultural interaction between the eastern and western worlds in 1955.[1] As a result of this meeting between advertisement, it's undergarment based sexualization, and cultural interactions, a recurring trend of underwear found a home in manga/anime culture.   Failed Failure is Ignored, Result = 1619 first came about in the release of the new 2012 products by Autodesk. Occasionally, when attempting to download the entire software package, the message will appear at the end stating "All files may not have been installed correctly". Underneath the sub headers of the facets of the Software that has been downloaded, there is a link that reads "View installation log file". This prompts a text-file based log showing the log file of the installation. Towards the bottom it will read Failed Failure is Ignored, Result = 1619. While some deviations from that sentence have occurred, such as "Failed Installation Aborted", and the number being "1603" instead of "1619", the meme's phrase is the most common of all.      The monster-like depiction of Spoo began in 2006 with a poorly drawn sketch by the Japanese singer and co-host of the show Shoko Haida (はいだ しょうこ)[2]. In the skit, Ms. Haida and Yuzo Imai perform a drawing & singing session together, during which Imai struggles to keep his composure after seeing Haida's rendition of Spoo: Transcript:       The original image is taken from the 2007 Chinese War Drama Series, Soldiers Sortie (士兵突击) and is of the main character Xu San-duo portrayed by actor Wang Baoqiang[1]. On July 8th, 2008 a user by the name of SuperAngryChinaMan posted a screenshot from the show on 4chan's weapon board /k/, asking for exploitables [2]. /k/ommandos obliged and shopping Xu Sanduo's face on military images became a staple on /k/. In the same thread, someone asked what the image should be named. Suggestions included Mack, Happy Camo face, Treepeeker or Happy Operator. However an anonymous user suggested "zergface", most likely in a joke associated with the Korean enthusiasm for Starcraft, and while it did not take immediately, it eventually stuck.  Redditor Eriksgata submitted the first instance to Reddit in a thread titled "The Most Interesting Cookie Monster In The World"[1] that linked to a Quickmeme[2] page on July 26th, 2011. The thread reached the front page of the r/adviceanimals subreddit and has accumulated 1,256 up votes as of October 26th, 2011. The video was launched by the campaign team of Herman Cain, a Chicago-based businessman and a Republican nominee candidate for the U.S. presidential election in 2012. Titled "Now is the time for action,"[1] video was simultaneously released on Herman Cain's campaign website[2] and his YouTube channel on October 19th, 2011. Since its upload onto YouTube, the video has been viewed over 1.4 million times in less than two weeks and is currently listed as the 8th most discussed clip in the News & Politics category. This meme originated in an episode of the series Loading Ready Run from the Escapist. It depicted the main character, John, being visited by his brother that he doesn't remember. His brother claimed to be his future self and tried to display fashion trends and memes from the future. One of the memes was using the words "In like Bob" to state that something was cool or popular. Ex: Your shirt is totally in like Bob.   In episode three "I'm Not Afraid of Anything Anymore" of Puella Magi Madoka Magica, the magical girl Mami Tomoe battles the witch Charlotte deep within her lair. After Tomoe deals what she thinks is a finishing blow, she is suddenly caught off-guard as Charlotte transforms into a giant caterpillar and decapitates Mami in one huge bite. The episode originally aired on January 20th, 2011. The episode was soon met by startled reactions from the fans, many of whom were surprised by the rather gory death of Mami. In mourning her death, a NicoNicoDouga[21] user posted a memorial video on January 22nd. Throughout the month, the character's death was discussed on anime-related forums and blogs like Animaku[19] and GaiaOnline.[20] On February 11th, 2011, the earliest known retelling took place on 4chan[1] (shown below). The series consists of five separate threads which cover the entire plot of the show. The users acted out the series using bad quality animation clips borrowed from the show and posts consisting of intentionally poor spelling and grammar, including of character names and show terms. The entire series can be found on the Puella Magi Wiki[2], both the archived threads and cleaned up versions. The fad originated from the Denver Broncos' quarterback Tim Tebow, who was photographed in the position as early as December 2010.[1] The pose itself is similar to the body building A Christian, Tebow is known for praying in this stance before games. However, on October 23rd, 2011, Tebow was photographed dropping to one knee after the Broncos came from behind to beat the Miami Dolphins 18-15.[10] Jared Kleinstein took the first Tebowing image outside of the Sidebar in New York City[11] that Sunday night, which was posted online to his Facebook account and received numerous likes. The next day, he created a Tumblr blog dedicated to showcasing pictures and purchased the domain Tebowing.com[2] on October 25th. The site defines the act as "to get down on a knee and start praying, even if everyone else around you is doing something completely different." Within the first 48 hours of launch, the site had well over 175,000 visitors and the term went viral. On January 28th, in a discussion topic on 4chan's /a/ about the fourth episode of the series, one anonymous user noticed that during a clip showing Madoka's class, everyone in the classroom had laptop computers except for one girl.[5] The first reply to this post was, "Fucking poorfag writing on paper."[5] which led to a huge discussion of the character and thus Poorfag-chan was born. The same day, her macro was created.[6] Despite her being a character seen only in the background of a few episodes and frequently being left out of artbooks, Poorfag-chan gained her own popularity as a character on /a/. The screen caps are taken specifically from the film Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, when Hermione had to tell Harry that multiple people told her that Hagrid is looking for Harry, to which Harry is confused. The earliest known instance of a 'horny harry' however is from a video titled "Harry el sucio Potter" (translates to "Dirty Harry Potter") which is a crude, short Spanish parody revolving around a horny harry. A scene similar to the image macro meme can be seen in the first half of the video. The Maury Povic Show was co-produced by MoPo Productions and the pilot episode first aired on September 9th, 1991. The show has since continued on for 21 seasons, often dealing with a variety of family disputes and domestic issues. Although paternity testing has been a recurring segment on the show for years, the phrase "you are not the father" didn't take off until an episode that was broadcast in January 2005. In the episode, Maury investigates the mother's claim that her ex-boyfriend Andrew fathered her child, which turned out to be false according to the test results. Upon hearing Maury say "Andrew, you are not the father," the man jumps up from his chair and dances around the stage. The advertising campaign was created by the global marketing firm Euro RSCG Worldwide.[2] The ads starred American actor Jonathan Goldsmith[3] as “the most interesting man” with narration by Will Lyman[4], best known for his narrating role in the public affairs TV program Frontline. Goldsmith's character is known for his catchphrases "I don't always drink beer, but when I do, I prefer Dos Equis," and "Stay thirsty, my friends." "I don't always drink beer, but when I do, I prefer Dos Equis," and "Stay thirsty, my friends." The ads first aired in the United States in 2006 and were uploaded to the wistl1976 YouTube[15] channel on April 10th, 2007. The same month, the promotional website StayThirstyMyFriends.com[6] was launched, where fans could upload videos of themselves performing toasts with a bottle of Dos Equis. The original eel pictures are created using the site anago.crap.jp[1], named after the japanese name for salt-water eels. The site allows people to create their own custom designed eels using a number of different features, symbols and colours. The first Eel anthro to be drawn seems to have been done by Tumblr user Gisu[2] on the 19th October 2011. The original photo is of the Miss Black USA Executive Director of Pageant Relations Karen Lyew, found on the Miss Black USA[1] online website. On Saturday October 22, 2011, the first image macro was posted on the Team Pervert[2] Tumblr blog and featured the caption "Complain about down low brothas / wants to have sex with Anderson Cooper." The character was first introduced via Reddit in a thread titled "My friends and I made these to honor a friend who can't ever seem to get the girl" posted under the AdviceAnimals subreddit on September 26th, 2011.   On June 26th, 2010, Youtube user MrXarlable[2] submitted a video titled "RiverSpice", which combined the song with Terry Crews. The video has since gained over 600,000 views in under 6 years. According to the video's description, the video was round 2 of YTP Soccer with YouTube user DWL1993.[3] Video Description: "…(Soccer) Round 2 with DWL1993, that’s why I’m still using Old Spice, it’s the source for the soccer ok." On July 11th, 2007, a photograph of a loin-clothed street musician playing the violin was submitted to 4chan with the caption reading “I shall sing you the song of my people." On September 17th, 2011, EdgarTMCC leaked the first song from the upcoming collaborative album by Metallica and Lou Reed, Lulu, titled, "The View" to YouTube[1] (shown below). The video gained over 1,900 dislikes against just 282 likes in roughly 9 years. On September 27th "The View" officially released as the lead single for Reed and Metallica's collaborative album. Near the end of "The View", Metallica singer James Hetfield sings the lyric "I am the table" a number of times. This can be heard starting at 2:05 in the song or official music video, released on December 3rd, which was re-uploaded to the Metallica YouTube[2] page in 2020 (shown below). I am the view! I am the table! I am the view, I am the table! I am all this! I am the root! The progress! The aggressor! I am the table! I am the ten stories! I am the table! I am! I am! I am! I am! I am! The triggering video of this fad was "Am I waiting for Team Fortress?" which was posted by the German YTPMV creator Healzer in around May 2010.[2] As indicated by the name, this video is a derivative of Team Fortress 2 fad. The original was deleted by Healzer himself, this video below is a reuploaded one.    The first Good Worker Machamp images initially surfaced on 4chan near the end of October 2011. Its image is Pokemon Yellow's Machamp sprite.    The original blank template originates from the Super Mario fan-site The Mushroom Kingdom[1] messageboard. On September 4th, 2006, in the thread "Guide to Kissing,"[2] user Mariko recalled his desire to request a role in his school's production of The Diary of Anne Frank[3] for the sole purpose of playing the role of a boy who has a kissing scene. In the thread, Mariko asks for recollections, personal experiences and advice. Among several replies citing each of the poster's poor experience with relationships, user TEM[4] posted the first reply of "Just do it, man." Days later on September 7th, TEM posted the original picture of his dog Boba Fett's [5] head on a color wheel background (shown below, left and right. TEM would confirm in the same thread that he created the image of his dog with reply #26: "I made the picture. That's my dog Boba Fett. After I had made it I said the almost exact same thing as IS."    The photograph of Netanyahu originates from a news photograph taken during the historic return of Israeli soldier and war prisoner Gilad Shalit[1] on October 18th, 2011. Shalit was abducted by Hamas fighters near the border in 2006 and had remained in captivity for over five years until the government reached a prisoner exchange deal with the Hamas organization on October 11th, 2011. As the nation rejoiced and celebrated the soldier's homecoming on a long religious holiday weekend, a picture of Netanyahu smiling at the ceremony began to circulate on the Israeli web. Taken by the military personnel, Shalitz can be seen embracing his father while the prime minister smiles in the background. While the market for stock photography has been steadily expanding since the 90s, an ironic appreciation for awkward stock photo clichés didn’t become widespread until Women Laughing Alone With Salad[2] was posted via The Hairpin on January 3rd, 2011. In addition, stock images have been also used in advice animal image macros prior to the emergence of the photo fad. According to CBS News[1], the term "stocking" was coined by the software company projekt202 employees Dennis Van Huffel and Jamie Graham in August 2011. "As anyone who has ever spent time looking for images for a project knows that this can be an extremely tedious and you come across some hilariously ridiculous images during the process," Van Huffel points out. "Anyway, Jamie [Graham] was clearly exhausted from looking around and not finding the right image. I suggested that we make our own and as we talked about it, we decided it would funnier to recreate one." On August 18th, 2011, Huffel and Graham launched the "Stocking is The New Planking" Tumblr[3] blog with a stock photo of a dark-haired woman pointing at a laptop screen accompanied by a man in a blue shirt. As suggested in the blog title, the idea stocking was inspired by the planking fad which began in March 2011. The earliest use of the phrase, specifically in the context of online fandom, can be traced to a forum discussion thread on the RuneScape fan community site Runelocus[8] on July 3rd, 2011. The phrase was used by forum member Smudge to sarcastically comment on video of a young girl dancing. On September 18th, 2011, Tumblr user ohmytardis[1] featured the phrase in a text post to highlight Scottish actor David Tennant (Doctor Who) as the archetype of male actors, the earliest known instance of the meme posted to the microblogging site.    The song "Space Jam" was performed by the Quad City DJ's, a musical group consisting of C.C. Lemonhead (Nathaniel Orange) and Jay Ski (Johnny McGowan), featuring vocal contributions from the singer JeLana LaFleur. The song was released in 1996 with the soundtrack for the eponymous film starring NBA athlete Michael Jordan and the cast of Looney Tunes. Before the arrival of YouTube, Quad City DJ's “Space Jam” was reportedly associated with a site made by a Something Awful user that was about wrestler Randy Savage, later being morphed into what was presumably a flash on 4chan's early /f/ board.[12] The earliest existing appearance of a SpaceJam remix used in these circles being on Newgrounds, and stemming from 4chan in November 1st, 2004.[25] The Space Jam remix that combined it with the chiptune song "Funky Stars" was also later featured on YTMND titled Savageslam, created on April 13th, 2005.[7]   While the art of photobombing may well precede the history of the Internet (as supported by authentic photographs showing The Beatles members pulling the prank on each others in the 1970s), one of the earliest known photobombers was Rollen Stewart[1] (also known as "The Rainbow Man"), who became a pop culture phenomenon in the late 1970s and early 1980s for wearing a rainbow-colored afro wig while holding up a sign reading "John 3:16" during live sporting events nationwide. Photobombing most likely became a widespread phenomenon on the Internet following the technological transition from traditional film to digital photography in the early 2000s, along with the emergence of photo-sharing communities like Flickr and Facebook a few years later.  Titled "Three Tamifluriver Sisters", the animated video was created by Niconico user Tsunamayo (ツナマヨ) and uploaded it to the site on Christmas Day of 2009. The video features the three sisters and bosses Lunasa, Merlin, and Lyrica Prismriver, known collectively as the Prismriver Sisters[2], hyper-actively dancing as if they've taken Tamiflu, the antiviral drug that became a subject of talk in Japan at the time for its abnormal side effects it had on children, hence the video's title. The song the girls are dancing to is remix of their theme from their appearance in Perfect Cherry Blossom "Ghostly Band ~ Phantom Ensemble"[3] titled "Rapid Ensemble", which was arranged by COOL&CREATE and featured on their famous 2004 remix album Touhou Strike.[4] The dance performed by the sisters at the start of the video was originally taken from a Bad Apple!! parody animation also created by Tsunamayo the month prior[5] while the rest make reference to many animation and MAD video fads that had become popular within Niconico. via Nico Nico Pedia[11]   The project was launched by Australian blogger Caelin[1] via Tumblr site "Minimal Movie Posters"[2] on September 30th, 2010. The site is open to user submissions and requests and each featured artwork contains a link to the original artist's website or merchandise store. According to the site's FAQ, Caelin has accumulated a collection of 2,000 unpublished minimal-style posters since the launch of the site in 2010. The source video of this fad which some guy was imitating an engine and gear changing sound was taken from a video sharing service outside Japan. It was reproduced to NND in May 9th, 2007, titled "Watch out the Foreigner's Driving Technique" (shown below, left).[1] Like air guitar, this style of human engine sound videos is called "Air Street Racer" on there. Nearly 2 years after, this funny gear change guy suddenly caught an attention by its MAD video using RED_ZONE which was the trending soundtrack for MADs in those days. This video was titled "Shift Change Red Zone", and posted to NND in February 10th, 2009 (shown below, right).[2]  The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise began as a comic book in 1984 before its TV adaptation into a cartoon show in 1987. In addition to the comic book and cartoon series, the franchise spawned several films, a merchandise line and an anime series. The “Teenage Mutant Ninja Noses” (TMNN) Tumblr[1] page was created on October 2nd, 2011. The first image featured on the blog was a photo of a child with drawings on his face, including a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle mask on his nose.  "Friend zone" is a dating term describing a relation in which one person wants to become intimate while the other prefers to stay friends. It has been frequently portrayed through popular music and TV sitcoms, with the earliest instance attributed to a 1994 episode of Friends in which the character Ross is labeled "mayor of the Friend zone" after unsuccessfully chasing after Rachel. The idea of being stuck in the "friend zone" was previously alluded in the 1989 comedic hip hop song "Just a Friend" by Biz Markie. The original stock photo of "Friend Zone Fiona" was taken as part of a set the weekend of July 14th – 16th in Kansas City, MO.[1] TriggerPhoto uploaded the image to iStockphoto[2] on October 15th, 2006 with the description "Jessica Simpson alike laughing." The first Friend Zone Fiona image macro was submitted to the Advice Animals sub-Reddit[3] on August 15, 2011, receiving 62 points.   Probably the first instance introducing this song to the web was the short flash animation posted to both dviantART and YouTube in January 14th, 2008 by a famous UK comedy animation production EDDSWORLD[2], and titled "Just a Bit Crazy". This video on YouTube has been watched over millions of times. The other video that led to a substantial increase in popularity of this song in YTPMV was "Ika No" which was posted to both YouTube and the Japanese video sharing service Nico Nico Douga (NND) by yamas in October 21st, 2010.[3] This vieo also featured the Japanese animation series Ika-Musume.   The 167th episode of the anime series Naruto Shippuden, named "Planet Devastation", first premiered on July 1st, 2010, and featured a battle between the characters Naruto and Pain. Following its broadcast, many viewers expressed their disappointment with the episode’s "weird" quality production and the excessive smear animation, especially in a scene where Pain punches the ground while shouting "My pain is far greater than yours!" The same day, youtuber kaihedgie uploaded a video titled "MY PAIN IS GREATER THAN YOURS! (Original)", featuring the scene and gaining over 86,000 views in the next five years.   The phrase is presumed to have originated in business culture prior to the introduction of the Internet. Before and after its association with John Laurinaitis, the phrase was used in numerous inspirational image macros (examples shown below). In 2004, retired professional wrestler John Laurinaitis replaced Jim Ross as Vice President of Talent Relations.[1] During 2004-2012 period, while Laurinatis remained in this role, WWE website announced the release of wrestlers and referees on its website wwe.com with a standard statement[2][3][4] which ended with "We wish X the best in all future endeavors" (example shown below). WWE has come to terms on the release of WWE Superstar Booker T and WWE Diva Sharmell as of October 27. We wish both Booker & Sharmell the best in all their future endeavors. On October 10th, 2011, Laurinatis was appointed the Interim Raw General Manager,[5] after which the :future endeavors" line gained association with him.[6] "RED ZONE" was written under the collaboration of the Japanese composers Tatsuya Shimizu, better known as his alias tatsh, and Naoki Maeda. The song was first included in beatmania IIDX 11: IIDXRED released for Japanese arcades in October 28th, 2004. This song entitled with "Red", this game's concept color, is the lead track of it. In addition, the edited version of this song has been included in Dance Dance Revolution series, an other music video game in same BEMANI line, since its 10th version: Super Nova 2 which was released in August 2007.[2]     The expression is believed to have originated between the 1940's to 1950's. One of the first known uses of the expression in popular culture was in the 1986 movie Little Shop of Horrors.      Photographs of Huang Yibo were originally published online in early May 2011 as promotional materials by the Young Pioneers, a primary school branch of the Communist Youth League. In the photographs, Huang is portrayed as an exemplary role model of student leadership, as he can be seen signing documents, presiding over meetings and visiting the elderly patients at a hospital. The pictures quickly spread on the Chinese web due to the obviously staged nature of the photo-op and the resemblance to cliche news photographs of government officials.   The meme traces its origin to the second episode of the second season of the popular anime K-On![1][2] (shown below, left), which first aired on April 13, 2010. In the episode, the group finds an old guitar. Their instructor tells them to pawn it, and it sells for ¥500,000 (roughly $6,500 USD). The group then starts wondering what they should do with their share when Ritsu, the drummer, waves ¥100,000 in front of Azusa, the rhythm guitarist. The image was capped and became viral on Japanese anime forums for a short while, eventually resulting in a second panel being added (shown below, right).  The title for the single topic Tumblr for “We are the 99 Percent”[1] came from a General Assembly poster shared on the official Occupy website in early August 2011. The name reflects the opposite of the nation’s richest 1%, who control nearly half of America’s total wealth, according to various research studies.[10] The blogger behind the project, a 28-year-old New York City activist only known as Chris, created the Tumblr on August 23rd, 2011 to put faces and stories to the nameless “99%.” In its first post, the blog asks readers to submit a photo of themselves holding a sign with a single sentence about how America’s financial situation is affecting their lives. The blog began curating photo submissions on September 8th, 2011. As of September 2012, the blog is still active but with a much smaller volume.  On October 1st, 2011, Redditor grim_fandango posted an image on the r/pics subreddit titled "And so ends 20 years of frustration,"[1] which contained instructions on how to fold a bed sheet. In the comments, Redditor KillerRefreshRate asked "How the hell do you get from 3 to 4?"[9], to which Redditor octal9 responded with a link to an instructional YouTube video. Redditor Wadsworth[2] commented on the video link with the following message: Redditor Redebo replied to Wadsworth saying, "perhaps this should be known as the Wadsworth Constant." On October 3rd, 2011, Cartoon Network teamed up with the online comic software company Bitstrips for Schools[1] to launch its anti-bullying campaign "Stop Bullying: Speak Up!" This social media campaign was meant to raise awareness about the dangers of bullying by encouraging visitors to illustrate their own scenarios using Bitstrips' comic generator. Once submitted to the site, each user contribution was showcased in the official gallery page[3] where members could vote for their favorite instances.        The phrase was originally quoted in an episode of the Adult Swim cartoon show Robot Chicken titled "The Twist," aired on April 17th, 2005.[4] In the episode, a clay-animated character parodying M. Night Shyamalan says the line after a twist ending is revealed.  As early as 1998, television fans were discussing the frightening aspects of these vintage logos online. One of the earliest threads was posted to the rec.sport.pro-wrestling[1] Usenet newsgroup on September 16th, 1998 asking if others found the "Big Purple Viacom 'V' of Doom" (shown below, left) scarier than the booming voice that said "Viacom" (shown below, right) in their 1990s bumpers. Three of the posters agreed that the V of Doom had invoked fear in them when they were younger.  Madoka Kaname is the protagonist of Puella Magi Madoka Magica, a highly successful original animation series aired in early 2011.[1] A notable characteristic of the character of this 14-year-old girl is having no confidence about herself. So, she often shows a frightened or a scared expression in the episodes. Among these, this Madoka's frightened expression in the 6th episode is regarded as the most impressive among fans. Her action figure from figma series released by Good Smile Company, a Japanese manufacturer of hobby products, featured this face expression as a swappable faceplate included as one of the option parts.[2] On August 19th, 2011, YouTuber KRZkreations posted a video showing the creation of the face in MS Paint (shown below). Clash on the Big Bridge debuted in Final Fantasy V, which was released for Japanese Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) in 1992.[2] The song was originally written as the theme music for the Big Bridge, one of the stages in the second world in this game by the Japanese video game composer Nobuo Uematsu.[3] Both the song and Gilgamesh have been popular among the fans of the final fantasy series since its first debut.  On December 4th, 1996, the Dexter's Laboratory episode "The Big Cheese" aired on Cartoon Network. [1] In the episode, Dexter studies for his French test at the last minute by using a device that teaches him while he sleeps. However, the recording he used skips and repeats "omelette du fromage" all night. The following morning, "omelette du fromage" is all he can say (clip below). On December 12th, 2009, Urban Dictionary [2] user MrSchwab defined "Omelete du fromage." They wrote,"The amazing phrase from Dexter's Laboratory in the episode 'The Big Cheese,' when he listens to a French recording overnight to learn said language. This consequentially gets stuck on repeat, on this phrase. The next day all he can say is 'omelette du fromage,' actually working to his advantage in everything he does (except at the end, when his lab blows up)." The post received more than 1,800 upvotes in less than 11 years (shown below). The original video was captured on camera by Russian YouTuber MrDron059[8] sometime in 2004 while his daughter’s friend was visiting. According to the video description, the cat wouldn’t stop making noises at his friend for reasons unknown. MrDron059 uploaded the video to YouTube[1] on September 28th, 2011; the video reached one million views within just a few days and became one of the most favorited and most discussed comedy videos in Russia.      The original photo was taken by AP photographer Winslow Townson[1] during a Baltimore Orioles game at the Boston Red Sox stadium on July 7th, 2011. The photograph shows Red Sox designated hitter David Ortiz rounding third base after hitting a home run. The Boston fans in the crowd behind him are seen cheering wildly while Orioles third baseman Mark Reynolds is idly eating sunflower seeds. The game ended with the Red Sox' victory (10 – 4). The image was adopted by Orioles' fans, in part, because Reynolds' complacency appeared to symbolize all of the problems with a team that would go on to lose 93 games and finish in last place in their division for 2011. On OriolesHangout forum, user Enjoy Terror first shared the picture in a thread titled "A picture is worth a thousand words"[2] on July 8th, 2011. On April 1st, 1984, a user calling himself K. Chernenko, referencing Soviet leader Konstantin Chernenko[2], joined Usenet's net.general, eunet.general, net.politics and eunet.politics groups, posting a peaceful message[3] claiming that Russia (known as the USSR[4] at the time) would be joining the Usenet network in order to have a platform of discussion with Americans and Europeans. The article claimed to come directly from the government of the Soviet Union, then referred to as The Kremlin. It was also signed with several different VAX domain names, including moskvax, mcvax, kremvax and kgbvax. While a majority of people assumed the post was a hoax due to it being made on April Fools' Day, many users were quick to fear a real threat coming from the Soviet Union. Replies were later compiled on sites such as Paul V's homepage[5] and 2meta.com[6], several threads are still archived on Google Groups.[7] - Wow! Is this for real? Honest-to-god Russia? Gee. I never thought that I'd see it. Does this imply that Unix is behind the Iron curtain? - Is this for real? Can we have confirmation from someone who is recognized as being in a position to know? - get out of our network!!! The earliest known examples can dated back to July 31th, 2009, when a thread was posted on one of the boards on 4chan. The thread was later screen-captured to highlight a series of chain posts featuring derivative examples.      The original two-pane image shows a siberian husky puppy, whose tag has been blacked out by the original poster. The puppy's eye markings are reminiscent of stereotypical high-arching villain eyebrows, which have been portrayed through popular cartoon and comics franchises, according to TV Tropes.[1] The photo was posted to Reddit on September 1st, 2011 by upparoom titled "My puppy will eat your soul and ask for seconds."[2] It received 1636 upvotes and 682 comments in the first month. Redditor DaveFishBulb was the first to call the dog Insanity Pup[3] two and a half hours after the post was made. The first derivation was posted by TychoVhargon[4] on the same day, with a Hypnotoad mashup image. The first image macro to appear outside of Reddit was posted to FunnyJunk[5] on September 4th, 2011.       The earliest notion of such grey area was first made on December 2nd, 1983 by Jerry Schwarz, who posted a message on Usenet[1] expressing his concerns about confusion during online interactions and how it may affect Usenet. He offered several suggestions for how to address these problems with online communication: This observation was further elaborated more than two decades later on August 10th, 2005, in a Christian forum discussion about possible flaws in the theory of evolution by natural selection.[2] In the thread, the original poster (OP) Heidi Carico, a well-known Creationist member on atheist / scientific discussion forums, attempted to dismiss evolution as a valid theory. After another user commented on the utility of using a winking smiley to indicate sarcasm, Nathan Poe reaffirmed this notion by saying: The thread gathered 176 replies on 18 pages, and a total of more than 41,000 views as of October 3rd, 2011.     On September 27th, Typhoon Nesat hit the coast of island nation Philippines, killing over 31 people and causing hundreds of million dollars in damages. On the following day, a photograph depicting three government officials wearing hard hats in what appears to be a disaster clean-up site was uploaded onto Department of Public Works and Highways' (DPWH) official Facebook page. The image apparently shows DPWH undersecretary Romeo Momo discussing the typhoon's damage with DPWH National Capital Region Director Reynaldo Tagudando and DPWH South Manila District Engineer Mikunug Macud along Roxas Boulevard in Manila Bay. The "Shining Finger Sword" is one of Domon Kasshu's two special signature moves in the anime Mobile Fighter G Gundam, the other move being the "Erupting Burning Finger". The move is accompanied by an epic barrage of cheesy dialogue, flashing colors, and a heroic soundtrack, making it a popular target of audioswap videos. The original Mobile Fighter G Gundam, which aired in Japan in 1994, didn't start the audioswap trend. But when the english dubbed version aired in 2002, people started taking notice of the cheesy dialogue, and the hilarity of the name of the special move in general.   The original comic was first posted on the daily comics site LOL-COMICS run by illustrator Chris Torres, also known as prguitarman and the creator of Nyan Cat, on December 31st, 2008.[1][2] In the original comic, the character describes how he's going to masturbate during New Years (shown below, left). Around April 2010, an edit of the comic surfaced on 4chan with the text replaced in a scenario where the drawn character is being mistaken as a girl by someone off-screen.[6] The character responds with a tounge-in-cheek response with Japanese phrases and mannerisms. In the last panel, the character holds his cheeks while uttering the phrase "doushio" (shown above, right). The phrase was inspired by the personality of Ash Ketchum's Charmeleon/Charizard[3] in the Pokémon animated series. On May 7th, 1998 (October 3rd, 1998 in America), the Pokèmon episode "The March of the Exeggutor Squad" aired in Japan. In this episode, the Charmander evolved into a Charmeleon. From that point until "Charizard Chills" (aired on July 22nd, 1999 in Japan; September 2nd, 2000 in America), his Charmeleon/Charizard disobeys Ash by often breathing fire on him and going to sleep. In the video game series, a certain number of Gym Badges (obtained by defeating various Gym Leaders) is needed to control stronger Pokèmon, this to maintain a balance in the earlier parts of the game. The anime deviates from this rule, because Ash had already obtained 11 badges before the beginning of this episode (8 from the Kanto region and 3 from the Orange Islands,) but Charizard still continued to disobey Ash.        Even prior to 1993, the month of September had been linked to the annual incursion of college freshmen students who acquired access to newsgroups for the first time, according to Wikipedia[1]. In 1993, the online service America Online began offering Usenet access to its tens of thousands, and later millions, of users. To many "old-timers", AOL users were often regarded as far less conducive to learn netiquette than university students, possibly caused by the walled-garden model of the AOL community. Unlike the usual short-lasting influx of university students, the sheer number of AOL users accessing Usenet didn't drop. Since that time, the dramatic development in the use of the Internet has brought a constant stream of new users. The term was first used by Dave Fischer in a January 26, 1994, post to alt.folklore.computers:          On September 10th, 1986, a film titled Bedroom Eyes[3] was released in the US. One of the earliest online mentions was created on August 3rd, 2004, when Urban Dictionary[1] user Mark H submitted an entry for bedroom eyes which defined it as:       The original photo comes from a horizontally flipped version of the Adélie penguin used in the Socially Awkward Penguin series (shown left), which first appeared on Tumblr in August of 2009. On January 13th, 2010, the "Fuck Yeah Socially Awesome Penguin"[6] Tumblr blog was created, with the first image macro featuring the caption "Say a word wrong / create hilarious inside joke"[8] (shown right). The first image macros were watermarked by Meme Generator[2], but the exact date of creation is currently unknown. On September 13th, 2012, novelist Andy Weir claimed responsibility for the meme in a Reddit AMA. [14] One user asked, "what is something secret about you that Reddit doesn't know?" Weird responded:  =Pending Further research=     The phrase was coined in the first episode of the series (shown below, left), uploaded via YouTube in 2006. In the episode, the charactures Yami Yugi and Kaiba are shown having their first duel during which Kaiba summons three Blue-Eyed White Dragons in a single turn, ignoring the rule that only one monster can be summoned during a turn. When Yami questions him about it, Kaiba says "Screw the rules, I have money!" The game was invented by blogger Liana Maeby, who explained the rules of the game in a blog article[1] posted on April 13th, 2009:    On September 15th, 2011, a news clip aired on the Phoenix area news station Fox 10[1] after a SUV driver lost control of his vehicle, hitting another car before striking into a utility pole. The power lines attached to the pole fell on the car, trapping the driver inside. A news reporter at the scene interviewed George Lindell, who was driving the car hit by the SUV, and a clip was uploaded to YouTube[2] by the FunnyLocalNews channel on September 16th, 2011. Within 4 months, the video accumulated over 600,000 views.   [Researching] Because both types of the phrase are also often used in real life, even before the internet, it is hard to track down the origin or its first appearance as an image macro. The photo was posted on Reddit by SineadNZ[1] on September 19th, 2011[2], titled "My husband is going to kill me for uploading this." The image is a school photo of her husband, taken circa 1994. He was told to bring his favorite things, so he brought his tie-dye shirt, a toy car from a Boy Scouts Pinewood Derby, and a trophy he won in a rocket building competition.[3] The original photo hosted via imgur[10] has been viewed over 780,000 times in the first six days of upload. The earliest archived usage of the phrase was on April 4th, 2011, on 4chan's /a/ (Anime & Manga) board[1], though it is rumored that it may have originated around 2010 from various pro-wresting discussion boards, like 420chan's /wooo/ board. The offline meet-ups and reenactment videos were inspired by a viral animated dance video titled "Just little funny movie (少し楽しくなる動画)," which is based on two music videos "Rodeo Machine" and "Screw the Plan" made for Japanese musician Yoshihiro Takahashi's solo project HALFBY.[1] The animation for the music videos were produced by a Japanese design team Groovisions in 2006. The two videos were bundled together into one and uploaded onto Japanese video-sharing site Nico Nico Douga (NND) on March 7th, 2007: The name "Nakasone OFF" is derived from a misinterpreted lyric heard in the song "Screw the Plan" and the Japanese shorthand "OFF" for offline meet-ups and flash mob events.[2] This video was first broadcasted on 'TyC Sports', a sports channel in Argentina. It shows a young man who had just bought a hamburger at a soccer game for 15 Argentinian pesos, who proceeds to make it clear that this is far too expensive. He says that, with the same amount of money, he could get an "Alto Guiso" (Guiso is a traditional meat and vegetable stew. It is quite cheap, and is usually consumed by the working class).  The meme originated in the Yu-Gi-Oh fandom on Tumblr. What started as a gif made by the mod of "yugioh-gifs.tumblr.com":yugioh-gifs.tumblr.com of the green haired Seto Kaiba (from the "Season 0" Toei version of Yu-Gi-Oh that never aired in the states) looking very sadly and creepily out a window while it's raining, became an instant joke, spawning numerous variations of the gif, music videos, artwork, and songs dedicated to it. On July 26th, 2011, Minecraft creator Markus "Notch" Persson posted an update on Google+[1] with an attached Minecraft screenshot showing several dark creatures in the distance: When the image was posted to Reddit[2] the same day, Notch replied to the thread saying he would name the new mobs "Endermen", referencing the mythical Slenderman creature, for the upcoming 1.8 update of the game.  The song "Evans" was originally written by a Japanese composer Yoshitaka Nishimura a.k.a DJ YOSHITAKA,[2] and it was first released as a secret track on online update for jubeat in December 15th, 2008. The song is famous for its extremely hard difficulty among players. This 1st original soundtrack CD for jubeat including Evans and Can-Can, another music resource of online parodies, was first released in February, 2009. In addition, its remix "Evans – prototype" has been included in the other music video game series in the same BEMANI line beatmaniaIIDX since its 17th version Serius released in 2009.   This pixiv's project, which means user-generated events of drawing in a same theme, was proposed by a Japanese illustrator/doujin mangaka Saiga[2] on February 26th, 2009.[3] This project, called as "My Waifu's Atomic Suplex Hold", was a simple & easy illustration response project of just tracing a template image prepared by the inventor. Prior to this pixiv project, a hand-drawn animated video meme featuring German Suplex, Spitting while Kissing, occurred on the Japanese video sharing service Nico Nico Douga (NND) in November 2008. However, it seems there are no direct relationships between them.    On September 18, 2011. Three Images of the meme were posted on Ponychan.net's /pic/ board. The meme drew attention and eventually, a template was posted, and the images were being flooded into the thread. The maker of the original images LovinDemMods, was eventually banned and the thread was deleted. The images are banned from ponychan because they do not spoil season 2 properly.     In 2001, artist Rebecca Murtaugh covered her bedroom in sticky notes[1], using neon ones for her most prized possessions and traditional yellow for the walls. Titled "To Mark A Significant Space in the Bedroom,"[2] it took six days and over $1000 to complete. She went on to complete several other sticky note installations. Three years later, Duncan Wilson and Sirkka Hammer[3] completed another sticky note installation. Called Pixelnotes, they created a wallpaper from four layers of gray sticky notes on top of a bright wall in their workspace. As people used the notes, shapes developed based on which sections were being torn off, similar to an art technique known as Décollage.[24] Sticky notes have even made their way to the walls of the Museum of Modern Art in 2004 as part of Paola Antonelli's exhibition Humble Masterpieces.[7] Sticky note art in everyday life stemmed out of creative collegiate pranks. One of the earliest documented instances is an April Fools Day prank staged at the M.I.T List Center Media Test Wall in 2003. Photographs from the event were uploaded via M.I.T Hacks' gallery page. 8] Several students put up a Trogdor mural made out of 2550 yellow and blue notes. On June 28th, 2011, the story "Sweet Apple Massacre" was submitted to the fanfiction archive site Fanfiction.net[2] by user bigmacintosh20111. In the story, the MLP:FiM colt Big Macintosh kidnaps the ponies Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo and proceeds to torture, rape and disembowel them. The story was subsequently removed from Fanfiction.net for violating the terms of service, but has since been reposted on several other websites. This song is Suwako Moriya's theme from the 10th Touhou game Mountain of Faith which was first released at the 72th Comiket in August 17th, 2007.[1]  On February 16th, 2009, the original photo of the boy (shown below, left) was uploaded by Flickr[1] user fordesman with the caption "Quite an annoying kid…." Nearly two and a half years later, on August 3rd, 2011, Redditor brobice submitted the first image macro instance of the series to /r/pics[2] in a post titled "We all knew this kid" with the caption "Let me tryyyy / I'm the guest" (shown below, right). Prior to being archived, the post received 3968 up votes and 344 comments. On September 12th, 2011, the tech news blog Wired[1] posted a leaked one minute clip showing footage from the upcoming second season of MLP:FiM. In the video, several ponies discover Discord at the entrance to a hedge maze, where he proceeds to disable their magical powers in order to make them play a game of his choosing. The same day, a screen capture of the footage was posted on the Cheezburger site My Little Brony.[27]  This song is Utsuho Reiuji's (nickname: Okuu) boss theme from the 11th Touhou game Subterranean Animism which was first released at the 74th Comiket in August 16th 2008.[1]  Slate decided to post an article about “How Black People Use Twitter” in August 2010, the article was regarded as something between offensive and ridiculous by many black bloggers and so the mockery began. (The Slate article made the mistake of treating black people as a monolith and the mistake of making condescending assumptions about how black folks relate to technology.) Since the article used an image of the (normally blue) bird that representes twitter, but instead with brown feathers, and a stereotypically "black" baseball cap, many people online began creating parodies of this image. Some of these images mocked common stereotypes about blackness, other customized the twitter-bird to match their personality. This was accompanied by a wave of tweets on the subject.  ((researching)) The term "Trust no bitch" shares its name with an Eazy-E song and may have originated from it. However, it seems that the line is derived from the phrase "Trust no bitch, fear no man". The phrase may have possibly originated from Myspace, as it is commonly used there as well.     The song's music is based on Reisn Udongein Inaba's theme from the 8th Touhou game Imperishable Night, titled "Lunatic Eyes ~ Invisible Full Moon", which was relesed at the 66th Comiket in August 15th, 2004.[2] "Stops at the affected area and immediately dissolves ~ Lunatic Udongein" was first released on the Touhou remix album Touhou Tsukitourou (Touhou Moon Lantern), released by IOSYS on December 31st, 2006 at the popular comic book convention Comiket. Its lyrics is written incoherently to suit Reisen's power causing insanity with her red eyes. And because her bullets in the original game have the look of a suppository, the later part of this song draws a parody of typical advert of suppository in Japan. Its title "Stops at the affected area and immediately dissolves" is also a common advertising copy for that. Because of the first word that appears in the animation, English-speaking Touhou fans usually call this "Overdrive". IOSYS launched the special page for this album on December 23rd, 2006 and released this promotion flash.[3] And the creator of this animation is Kagi who also created the promotion flash animation for "Marisa stole the Precious Thing". The feature of this animation is including parodies of other internet fads and subcultures: Kimoi Girls, Leekspin and some SHIFT-JIS Arts. This video reuploaded to NND in April, 2007 has got over 2 million views.[4] Booberday was founded by Google user Raleigh B[1] on the social networking site Google+ in a post titled "Its officially BOOBERDAY!!!!"[2] from September 3, 2011. The post included an attached image of a shirtless teenage boy. This meme was first started August 20, 2011 on the Gamefaqs S&R: Baseball board. Brewers fans were accusing other members of doing damage control after laughing at K-Rod for blowing a lead against the Mets. The Brewers came back and won the game and then the firemen pics came out, first seen here: http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/2000206-sports-and-racing-baseball/60084391?page=1&tc=BRENDENWALDEN The meme quickly spread on GFaqs S&R: Baseball and is now used in numerous instances when someone makes an incorrect prediction or statement and then tries to backtrack. On August 14th, 2011, a video titled “Official Ojai Valley Taxidermy TV Commercial” was uploaded via YouTube. The video featured several skits in which people were fooled into thinking Testa's taxidermied animals are alive before he would suddenly appear and proclaim “Nope! Chuck Testa.” The video remained largely unnoticed until it was submitted to Reddit in a post titled "This is probably the funniest low-budget commercial I have ever seen"[4] by user LunaMcLovin on September 15th, 2011. The post reached the front page and received over 12,000 up votes within the first 24 hours. Within eight months, the video had accumulated over 11 million views. Parodies of mafia cliches have been in existence for decades in pop culture. On YouTube, there are numerous home movies of babies titled "baby godfather." The original image of the baby in tuxedo was first posted by Redditor timekeepsgoing[6] in a thread titled "Reddit, I've seen the way you do it….Will you do it again??" on February 22nd, 2011. The thread was positively received by the community and led to a number of photoshopped images: On the same day, the earliest instance of Baby Godfather was uploaded via Quickmeme[2] (left), but the series didn't get featured on the homepage until September 11th (right), which featured a variation of Don Corleone's quote from The Godfather III. Baby Godfather has since spread to Buzzfeed[1], Memebase[3], Runt of the Web[4] and FunnyJunk[5]. The image macros have also spread among Polish internet users and dozens of Polish iterations can be found on MemeGenerator[7].           Blogger Charles Lavoie created the first "Christ, What an Asshole" comic in a 2006 blog post entitled "How 'Christ, What an Asshole!' is the Answer to the New Yorker Magazine Caption Contest."[1] The blog takes a number of comics published by the New Yorker and replaces the caption with "Christ, what an asshole." The blogpost sets up that these would be a proper entry for the New Yorker caption contest, a monthly call for submissions from New Yorker readers. The phrase likely predates its internet usage as a means of qualifying or commenting on another's actions, sarcastically responding to another's attempts to appear passionate about their actions or brag about how intense they took an action. On September 23rd, 1997, rapper Busta Rhymes released the album When Disaster Strikes…, which featured the song "So Hardcore."[1] The song uses the expression to exemplify intensity, with the lyrics "So hardcore like Quickdraw McGraw / Fuck what you heard, you ain't heard this before" (shown below, left). On November 1st, 2011, Blogspot[2] user benmarvin shared the earliest available version of the Rage Comics (shown below, right).     On the day of September 10th, 2011, into the morning hours of September 11th, the members of the Bronyville Podcast were having a 13-hour long live-stream of the entire first season of the show to commemorate the new and upcoming Season 2 of My Little Pony Friendship is Magic. Near the end of the stream, an advertisement repeatedly popped up in the bottom right corner of the screen, featuring an image of the X-Men character Magneto, as well as a caption of "Click here to unleash Magneto's Powers!". Eventually the streamers and the viewers caught onto this notable popup, and it became a topic of discussion between the Bronyville members and the special guests, which included Phoe of Equestria Daily and a well-known fan-fiction writer, Midnight Shadow. It remained simple discussion until partway into episode 26, when the song "At the Gala" began playing. Apple Cider, a member of the Bronyville team, was egged on and eventually began singing along with the show. While he was singing "At the Gala" the Magneto advertisement once again appeared causing a spontaneous riot with the podcast. Almost immediately after Magneto appeared Apple Cider began changing parts of the song he was singing to involve Magneto and magnet-themed topics.   The oldest documented comic using the Big Grin was submitted in deviantArt in April 14, 2009, by the user ActiveMobius.[2]  On August 9th, 2010, YouTuber stevenintheevening shared the video. The post received more than 1.4 million views and 15,000 likes in less than 11 years (shown below). The earliest instance of Batmanning on YouTube dates back to July 20th, 2008, when YouTuber keralady uploaded a video showing a group of young adults hanging upside down from the handrail on a moving subway car. Over the span of three years, the video remained relatively unknown with a little over 31,000 views. On August 29th, 2011, a group of college students uploaded a video titled "Original Batmanning video" onto their YouTube channel. It was created by the Lins Brothers[1], a group of friends at Purdue University who have been making YouTube videos since January 2008.[2]  The original image was posted by Tumblr user DaringCatastrophe[4] on September 7, 2011, showing a short snippet of an iPhone conversation featuring an ordinary whale and a baby version. As of September 10, 2011, the original post had gained over 240,000 notes on Tumblr.      I Just Had Sex is a song from comedy group, The Lonely Island guest starring music writer and performer Akon. I Just Had Sex premiered on Saturday Night Live on December 18, 2010 and was posted to YouTube a day later. The meme is derived from a lyric from the song where Lonely Island members Jorma "Jorm" Taccone and David Andrew "Andy" Samberg are pondering why the girls they had sex with wanted to have sex. Akon interrupts each line (bar the last) saying "Doesn't matter had sex".    The base image comes from a Corbis Images[9] stock photo titled "Teacher Pointing at Map of World." The first Quickmeme[1] submission was uploaded on September 3rd, 2011. The image was posted to the advice animals subreddit[2] the same day in a thread by Me_bender titled "Unhelpful High School Teacher." It received 2163 upvotes and an overall score of 665. A video titled "Man Goat" was uploaded by YouTuber SmoothFeather on November 30th, 2007, featuring a goat repeatedly bleating while tied to a rope. The video description claimed the goat was discovered during a hike in Peru. Justin Mclennan came across this goat while hiking in Peru. He couldn't figure out who was yelling until he came across this little guy :) The most viewed version of the video was re-uploaded by YouTuber latestvideoss[1] on August 18th, 2008. In the next five years, the video gained upwards of 3.5 million views and 5,300 comments.  The short film was directed by David Lewandowski[1] as the final episode of the anthology series Everything[3], which is part of the nonprofit film festival Channel 101.[4] Director David Lewandowski is best known for his position as lead graphics animator for the 2010 film Tron: Legacy.[2] The video was uploaded to both Vimeo and YouTube on September 2nd, 2011, garnering 482,000 views and 1,000,000 views respectively in the first days. On YouTube, the video also earned the #2 spot in Top Favorited (This Month) in Comedy for September 2011, as well as #2 Top Favorited of This Week.    The original video is taken from a short named "People in Order" by Lenka Clayton and James Price. It originally aired on UK’s Channel 4 in May, 2006 and was presented in several film festivals in 2006-2008.[1] Among them, the Portable Film Festival, an online film festival in Australia[2], officially uploaded this video to their web site[3] and YouTube in 2007. The short shows people aged from 1 to 100 playing the same drum one after another, and the video on YouTube became a viral hit around the begining of 2008. This video was also reported by a Japanese web magazine GIGAZINE[4], and was reproduced to NND by a reader of that magazine in January, 2008.[5] On NND, it hadn't been popular as much as that on YouTube. But some NND users focused attention on the unique looks of 59-year-old man in this video. Because his looks reminded Japanese people of the typical image of god appearing on video games, he gradually became to be called "God" by them.   The phrase was first uttered in the February 15th, 1998 episode of The Simpsons titled "Das Bus"[2] in which Homer Simpson attempts to operate an internet provider service out of his home. Knowing nothing about what he was getting in to, when a customer comes to procure hardware, Homer greets him with "Welcome to the Internet, my friend, how can I help you?" (shown below). Online, the phrase took on a more exclusionary point of view in a January 2000 blog post by redpaw.[3] The lengthy post was directed towards individuals who were not familiar with internet culture and introduced the idea of the internet as a "meritocracy," where people are not judged by what they possess offline, but by how they interact with others in virtual space. It also provided 19 guidelines suggesting how to interact with people on forums, chat rooms, web pages and e-mail. That year, the message was reposted on a number of LiveJournal blogs[4], message boards[5] and Usenet groups.[6] Some of you are smart enough to realize that, when you go online, it's like entering a foreign country … and you know better than to ignorantly fuck with the locals. You take the time to listen and think before speaking. You learn, and by learning are gladly welcomed. For some of you, it takes a while, then one day it all dawns on you – you get it, and are welcomed into the fold. Some of you give up, and we breathe a sigh of relief – we didn't want you here anyway. And some of you just never get it. The offensively clueless have a special place in our hearts – as objects of ridicule. We don't like you, but we do love you. You will get mad. You will tell us to go to hell, and call us "nerds" and "geeks". Don't bother … we already know exactly what we are. And, much like the way hardcore rap has co-opted the word "nigger", turning an insult around on itself to become a semiserious badge of honor, so have we done. "How dare you! I used to beat the crap out of punks like you in high school/college!" You may have owned the playing field because you were an athlete. You may have owned the student council because you were more popular. You may have owned the hallways and sidewalks because you were big and intimidating. Well, welcome to our world. Things like athleticism, popularity, and physical prowess mean nothing here. We place no value on them … or what car you drive, the size of your bank account, what you do for a living or where you went to school. Allow us to introduce you to the concept of a "meritocracy" – the closest thing to a form of self-government we have. In The United Meritocratic nation-states of the Internet, those who can do, rule. Those who wish to rule, learn. Everyone else watches from the stands. You may posses everything in the off-line world. We don't care. You come to the Internet penniless, lacking the only thing of real value here: knowledge. "Who cares? The Internet isn't real anyway!" This attitude is universally unacceptable. The Internet is real. Real people live behind those handles and screen names. Real machines allow it to exist. It's real enough to change government policy, real enough to feed the world's hungry, and even, for some of us, real enough to earn us a paycheck. Using your own definition, how "real" is your job? Your stock portfolio? Your political party? What is the meaning of "real", anyway? Do I sound arrogant? Sure … to you. Because you probably don't get it yet. If you insist on staying, then, at the very least, follow this advice: 1) No one, ESPECIALLY YOU, will make any law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances. 2) Use your brain before ever putting fingers to keys. 3) Do you want a picture of you getting anally raped by Bill Clinton while you're performing oral sex on a cow saved to hundreds of thousands of people's hard drives? No? Then don't put your fucking picture on the Internet. We can, will, and probably already HAVE altered it in awful ways. Expect it to show up on an equally offensive website. 4) Realize that you are never, EVER going to get that, or any other, offensive web page taken down. Those of us who run those sites LIVE to piss off people like you. Those of us who don't run those sites sometimes visit them just to read the hatemail from fools like you. 5) Oh, you say you're going to a lawyer? Be prepared for us to giggle with girlish delight, and for your lawyer to laugh in your face after he explains current copyright and parody law. 6) The Web is not the Internet. Stop referring to it that way. 7) We have already received the e-mail you are about to forward to us. Shut up. 8) Don't reply to spam. You are not going to be "unsubscribed". 9) Don't ever use the term "cyberspace" (only William Gibson gets to say that, and even he hasn't really used it for two or three books now). Likewise, you prove yourself a marketing-hype victim if you ever use the term "surfing". 10) With one or two notable exceptions, chat rooms will not get you laid. 11) It's a hoax, not a virus warning. 12) The internet is made up of thousands of computers, all connected but owned by different people. Learn how to use your computer before attempting to connect it to someone else's. 13) The first person who offers to help you is really just trying to fuck with you for entertainment. So is the second. And the third. And me. 14) Never insult someone who's been active in any group longer than you have. You may as well paint a damn target on your back. 15) Never get comfortable and arrogant behind your supposed mask of anonymity. Don't be surprised when your name, address, and home phone number get thrown back in your smug face. Hell, some of us will snail-mail you a printed satellite photograph of your house to drive the point home. Realize that you are powerless if this happens … it's all public information, and information is our stock and trade. 16) No one thinks you are as cool as you think you are. 17) You aren't going to win any argument that you start. 18) If you're on AOL, don't worry about anything I've said here. You're already a fucking laughing stock, and there's no hope for you. 19) If you can't take a joke, immediately sell your computer to someone who can. RIGHT NOW. Pissed off? It's the TRUTH, not these words, that hurts your feelings. Don't ever even pretend like I've gone & hurt them. We don't like you. We don't want you here. We never will. Save us all the trouble and go away. The clip comes from Colin Evans' independent skate film "South in your Mouth" The film premiered on November 26th, 2010 at the Hollywood 3 in Sumner, Christchurch, New Zealand.[2] The clip of Levi with a faux accent was first uploaded to YouTube as "Negg Minute" on May 8th 2011. It was reuploaded by phillyfan06 as Nek Minute[4] on August 16, 2011. This version of the video has 100,000+ more views than the original. On October 4th, 2009,FunnyJunk[1] user chadpk uploaded an image macro of a man grinning at a piece of fried chicken with the caption “Oh chicken strip / you so crazy.” (shown below)    first seen 29th. August on the norwegian image-board artige.no here is the pic: http://www.artige.no/bilde/11001 It was unnoticed untill another user picked up the picture and made this: http://www.artige.no/bilde/11047 It's a often seen meme on the image board now days.  The word "yandere", a term that blossomed in moe fandom, refers to a character who is crazy about someone else. Literally. Despite the anime-inspired name, this type of character is much, much older than that, as one of the earliest examples is Medea of Greek Myth. The character almost always appears perfectly cute and harmless on the surface… but underneath they may be obsessive, controlling, and sometimes just plain insane. Woe to anyone who happens to be the object of their often genuine affection. Even more pity should be saved for anyone who gets in the way – the psycho-obsessive is amazingly unwilling to put up with any rivals (but the rivals had it coming). There could be a long mental instability, else the girls have always been just a little off. Could be the product of Break the Cutie. Often eventually goes off the deep end and becomes an Ax Crazy Girl with Psycho Weapon, and that's just fun! Via : Television Tropes[2] In spite of its quite ridiculous rendering, yandere has been one of the standard character types in Japanese Anime/Manga/Game since middle of 2000s. And, many products that set yandere itself to its main theme like this CD series have also been released because of its popularity. CD for this series has been released three times and 12 "yandere" girls are starring in totall. Among them, the most popular Yandere girl is Nagisa Nonohara appearing in the first CD. She loving her brother absolutely is called "The Yandere Sister" (ヤンデレ妹, Yandere Imouto). In addition, in those days, her voice actor Yurika Ochiai[3] was famous for her illness speech and behavior on Japanese web. So, Nagisa's "yandere" was felt much more realistic than that of other girls by listeners, and her visual and remarks became some sort of the symbol of this series. On November 16th, 1994, fanfic writer The Dark Ranger first posted the story onto the Usenet alt.sex.stories[1] newsgroup where it became highly controversial due to its disturbing content that seems to have been written for the author's pleasure. The catchphrase comes from a set of lines from the 2004 comedy Mean Girls.[1] In the film Karen Smith, played by Amanda Seyfried asks Cady Heron, played by Lindsay Lohan “So if you’re from Africa, why are you white?” to which Gretchen Wieners (Lacey Chabert) admonishes “Oh my god Karen, you can’t just ask people why they’re white.” One of the first edited versions of the quote was applied to Harry Potter, with Harry asking Voldemort "Why don't you have a nose," and Dumbledore admonishing "God Harry, you can't ask people people why they don't have noses." The quote appeared online as early as December 4th, 2010, on Yahoo! Answers.[2]  [Help Needed] While the origin of Tentaspy is still unknown, it is rumored to have been started because of a crossover between TF2 and The Little Mermaid, and The Spy was crossed with the character Ursula, a sea witch who is part octopus[3].  The quote originally appeared in the 1998 kaiju film Godzilla. During a scene where the military plans to lure Godzilla into a trap, Matthew Broderick's character sees this and comments on the situation in a very matter-of-fact manner. The scene was later uploaded to YouTube by user Eebro0 on October 30, 2009 (shown below). The first known instance was posted to the blog HALOLZ[4] with the caption "Wake up on Island / Punch trees" on October 18th, 2010. The post has accumulated 145 shares on Facebook and received an average of 4.28 out of 5 stars from 212 votes as of November 1st, 2011. The song's original title is CAPSULE PRINCESS ~ Fushigina Kusuri composed by Keiichi Ueno "feat. SATOE", featured in the rhythm game Pop'n Music THE MOVIE.[1] The first MAD video using this song, "I was made to drink the Wonder Drug" featured Pikachu from the Pokémon series. It was uploaded in Nico Nico Douga on May 29th, 2010, and had been watched over 2 million times until it was deleted by the copyright claim.[2]   Captain Hindsight first appeared in Season 14, Episode 11 of South Park titled "Coon 2: Hindsight" which aired on October 27th, 2010. In the episode, Captain Hindsight arrives at the scene of Deepwater Horizon oil spill, but instead of trying to resolve the crisis at hand, he explains to the crowd the precautions that should've been taken to prevent the disaster. Suddenly relieved, the crowd applaud as Captain Hindsight leaves behind the devastated beach: The show's creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker later explained that character's mock-superpower was inspired by the heavy hindsight bias in the news analysis following the outbreak of BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2011.  The trigger of this fad was made by a YouTube poop creator Kespainify[3] as a YTPMV for My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. This video "Myskinsoft Pony Remover" was posted to YouTube on April 11th, 2011.  The earliest known usage and definition of the term "cray cray" was published in the Online Slang Dictionary[1] on December 24th, 2001. That day, user Jeremy submitted the definition (shown below) "crazy, i.e. strange, insane, or wild."   Fails of the Weak was originally started in September 2010, under the video "Halo: Reach – Six Fails"(later renamed "Fails of the Weak #0 – The Inception") The series was created to showcase fan submitted clips of themselves failing playing the then-recently released video game "Halo: Reach", the final entry to the Halo series produced by Bungie. Soon after its release the series grew immensely popular, with thousands of user-submitted clips being submitted daily. Commentary is provided by Geoff Ramsey and Jack Pattillo, the former becoming extremely popular for his laugh, often adding a second layer of humor to the videos. An episode of "Fails of the Weak" The term “sweded” was coined in the 2008 Michel Gondry comedy film Be Kind Rewind, starring Jack Black and Mos Def. The film takes place in Passaic, New Jersey, where the declining VHS rental store “Be Kind Rewind” loses its entire video collection after being inadvertently magnetized. Mike (played by Mos Def) and Jerry (played by Jack Black) attempt to replace the store’s video collection by recreating films using a camcorder and claiming they are special editions from Sweden. The BeKindMovie YouTube[4] channel was created to promote the film on December 10th, 2007. The first video uploaded to the channel was a sweded version of the 1991 film Boyz in the Hood (shown below, left). On December 22nd, 2007, the BeKindMovie channel uploaded a video titled “How to Swede” (shown below, right), featuring instructions on how to produce a sweded film.  The Princess Bride was released on October 9th, 1987. The movie features a character named Inigo Montoya played by Mandy Patinkin, who is obsessed with avenging his father's death. He explains to a new acquaintance when he meets the man who killed his father he attends to say, When he finally confronts his father's killer, he repeats the phrase over and over as he fights him.      In 2003, in the Something Awful Forums, user began to draft up a game. The game revolves around the concept of time travel. Shii.org has archived script drafts and fanart. The entire game was planned to be be completed in less than a year, however only one person on the team had previous game development experience as a professional developer. He was banned from the project for criticizing it. Beginning in the 1990's, "Werther's Originals" began an television advert campaign in Great Britain, Germany, and other parts of the world featuring grandads expressing nostalgia for the caramel candy and their joy of sharing them with their grandsons, one of which starred the late British actor Arnold Peters[1] as the granddad. This particular commercial would later be dubbed in Japanese and exported to television stations in Japan in 2003. On July 15th, 1999, Turner Classic Movies released Goodnight Moon and Other Sleepytime Tales,[1] a primarily animated home-video special consisting of readings of bedtime stories like Goodnight Moon, and featuring narration from Susan Sarandon. The video contains a number of interviews with children about dreams. On January 24th, 2011, YouTuber[5] lololark uploaded a compilation of the interviews, gaining over 181,000 views in 10 years. At the end of the video is a blooper in which a boy in a red shirt attempts to say something about dreams, but stumbles over the sentence, making it completely incoherent (shown below). They also uploaded the isolated clip to their channel,[4] garnering over 1.7 million views in the same span of time. On June 2nd, 2011, YouTuber[3] mrblueangeldood uploaded the isolated clip of the boy fumbling his sentence, titled "Have you ever had a dream like this?" The clip went viral, gaining over 67 million views in 10 years (shown below). Have you ever had a dream that you, um, you had, your, you- you could, you’ll do, you- you wants, you, you could do so, you- you’ll do, you could- you, you want, you want him to do you so much you could do anything?     Doctor John A. Zoidberg is a fictional character for the Futurama television series. He is an alien that appears like a mix between a lobster and an octopus, and serves as a doctor despite his poor understanding of human physiology.[1] A "Futurama Zoidberg"[2] Quickmeme page was created on July 5th, 2011. The first submission was captioned with "You call that an ink defense? Blughidihlgidgldgdd…"[10] The same day Redditor mrrabbitfluff posted a thread titled "Zoidberg offers himself"[3] that linked to a Quickmeme submission with the text "Need a new meme? Why not Zoidberg?" The post reached the front page and has received 6,665 up votes as of September 23rd, 2011.  Redditor bloodberrypie posted a thread titled "Dusted off my tablet because I felt bad for it, too lazy to finish. This will probably never see the light of day again…." that included a screenshot of an unfinished drawing of a woman on August 25th, 2011. The earliest known instance of Celebrity Pokemon Evolution chart was uploaded by Redditor travmasterx[1] on August 9th. The image thread accrued a 68% Like rating on the site with over 800,000 views.

The Missingno species was first discovered by Nintendo in the original title "Pokémon Red Version and Blue Version," which was published in the May 1999 issue of Nintendo Power. Describing the phenomenon as a "programming quirk," Nintendo warned the gamers against encountering it, claiming the game may have to be reset completely in order to remove the graphical errors. Since becoming a well-known trivia among Pokémon gamers in 1999, there has been extensive discussions about encountering MissingNo on purpose, which involves trigger three in-game events to summon the glitch.  An ESPN article titled "What if Michael Vick were white?"[1] featuring a photoshopped image of Vick with white skin was published on August 25th, 2011.

The first Instance of pictures in this style can be found in a Reddit thread titled "Rarity's horn has really gotten her lost now", created by supermatt314 within the MYLITTLEPONY sub forum on August 24th 2011. The thread contained 5 pieces of art with Rarity Photoshopped in. The Reddit thread also inspired YouTube user MeuhCoin to upload a YouTube video titled "RARITYQUEST" in the style of the BRODYQUEST video by NeilCicierega[2]. The meme did not gain any notoriety until it made its way to Ponibooru.The first series of pictures of this style were uploaded to Ponibooru on August 25, 2011 by loopul.[3] The picture was labeled with the tag "rariquest", which was a pun to reference her situation in the "The Cutie Mark Chronicles" episode, as if she traveled through all of those places before finding her destiny.  The expression "why don't we have both?" was originally quoted by a child model in a TV commercial for the Old El Paso at-home taco kit that contains both hard-shell and soft tortillas. In the commercial, a group of Spanish speakers are seen arguing over the quality of hard and soft tacos, to which the girl proposes “Why not both?” with a shrug and puts an end to the debate. Though it is unclear when the commercial first aired, it was discussed online as early as September 2009.[1]   On March 12th, 2010, the official reveal trailer for then-upcoming video game Deux Ex: Human Revolution premiered[1] (shown below, left). In the trailer, main character Adam Jenses says "I never asked for this" in reference to his cybernetic augmentations. On December 13th, 2010, the extended cut CGI trailer for the game premiered[2] (shown below, right), with the line again being used. In the game, Jensen can optionally say the phrase while talking to NPC Cassandra Reed during "Motherly Ties" side quest (gameplay video shown below).[3] - I can't get over just how much they've… changed you/ At first, I couldn't even believe you were still alive. How do you handle all of this? - I never asked for this. They say they saved me, but I'm not sure saved is the right word. On February 4th, 2011, Neogaf user Kinyou[4] made a post in which they wrote that they could not get the line "I never asked for this" out of their head. The line gained popular recognition in mid-June 2011. On June 15th, 2011, Neogaf[5] user Dizzy-4U used the line as a humorous response in a thread. On June 23rd, 2011, Neogaf[6] user NIN90 reacted with the line to an image posted by another user.         On March 4th, 2009, the bernietv1 YouTube channel uploaded a music video for the song "Weekend At Bernie's Dance" by the rap artist Tre-Doh.

In an interview with the Associated Press[1] on April 7th, 2003, Republican senator Rick Santorum expressed his belief that American consenting adults do not have a constitutional right to privacy with respect to sexual acts. He also added that consensual gay intercourse could be government-regulated, similar to how states restrict other sexual acts like adultery, polygamy, child molestation, incest and bestiality in protecting the values of society and the American family. Upon its publication on April 20th, 2003, Senator Santorum's interview response drew harsh criticisms from the press, civil rights groups and other Democrats, mainly for his unsavory comparison of homosexuality to incest, polygamy and adultery. One of the staunchest critics of Santorum's remarks was the sex advice columnist Dan Savage, who took one of his readers' suggestion and organized an open contest on his syndicated blog column "Savage Love"[2] for people to come up with an unflattering definition for the Republican senator's family name "Santorum." By May 29th, Savage reported that he had received over 3,000 suggestions for the definition of the word. On June 12th, he announced the winning bid, defined as following:   On August 21th 2010, Youtube-user Chinelin started the fad by posting his video Double D's Epic Kirby Doorbell on Youtube. In it, the doorbell sounds like the well-known melody from Kirby Superstar. The first one to contribute to the fad was DingosPwnTheWorld, who gave the doorbell a Star Fox 2 sound. This video was submitted the day after. After this, many more videos followed, of which some can be found in the Video Section. According to Dictonary.com,[1] the term “overkill” was coined in 1946 to describe the combined power of the United States and the U.S.S.R.’s nuclear arsenal. Though primarily used in a military context during the Cold War period, the word gradually came into generic use in 1965 as a more general description of excessive physical force.      Tumblr and YouTube have both been widely attributed as the origin of the Regional Dialect video series, as it grew through communities on both sites at the same time. The collaborative project may have been conceived as a tool of reference for actors who need accent training, though its creator remains unknown. The earliest known response video titled "Regional Dialect Meme" was posted by Tumblr user thefrogman[1] on January 5th, 2011:    On August 1st, 2011, the Mexican television station Televisa aired a trailer for an episode of La Rosa de Guadalupe titled "Cosplay Salvemos al mundo" ("Cosplay Saves the World"). The trailer was posted to 4chan's /a/ (Anime & Manga) board[9] the same day and received negative reactions for portraying a false stereotype of the cosplaying subculture. The character was created on the Spanish rage comic site Cuanto Cabrón by user premutos[1] on April 21st, 2011. The comic featured a man fleeing from a woman with his jet pack after she informs him that she has a boyfriend.      Grand Theft Auto III, released on October 22nd, 2001, was the first game in the series to incorporate a multi-pane collage of guns, characters and locations on the box art, which subsequently became the signature style of GTA cover artworks. On June 12th, 2005, a photoshopped cover of Grand Theft Auto III titled “Grand Theft Auto Somalia” was posted to the Internet humor site Fugly.[1]      Perry the Platypus first appeared in the pilot of Phineas and Ferb, which first aired on August 17th, 2007.[1] In the episode, Perry is revealed to be a secret agent who is posing as a domesticated animal (shown below).       The phrase has been used in discussions threads on sites like the Democratic Underground[5] forums as far back as January 19th, 2004. The earliest known animated GIF version shows a snail transforming its shell into a jetpack before flying out of frame with the caption "Abandon Thread" flashing in red. It was uploaded to ThreadBombing.com[1] on August 14th, 2009. The GIF was made from a clip of a CGI test video from Spon.com[3] titled "Spontaneous Snail" that was uploaded to YouTube on November 21st, 2006.  On November 10th, 2009; the highly anticipated Call of Duty:Modern Warfare 2 was released in both North America and Europe, shattering sales records in the process. In the days following the release, many players noticed the Arabic language voice overs for the Opfor faction in both Single and Multi-player sounded like insults in English with the most notable being "Tango Sucka" as well as others such as "Bambi!" and "Your Mother!"    The earliest known image macro was posted on the picture hosting site Chan4Chan[7] on January 20th, 2009, which featured a photograph taken during filming of the 2009 comedy film The Rebound in which a man representing the /b/ (random) board exposes himself to a family representing the Internet (shown below). The song was composed by the Taiwanese singer Lui Jiachang, best known for his eccentric and smart hit singles in the 80s, and produced by his son and pop singer Jeremy Lui (劉子千). The music video also features another Taiwanese celebrity Gui Gui (鬼鬼). The music video for "Nian Ni" was first uploaded via Taiwanese MTV on July 7th, 2011 and re-uploaded via YouTube on July 8th, 2011. The song began to spread through Chinese and Taiwanese forums for a brief period of time before the music video aired on MTV later that month. Upon its broadcast, both the song and the music video were poked fun at for its "brainwashing" tune, lyrics that are hard to follow and the singer's less-than-flattering voice. The YouTube video also became notable for its high dislike-to-like ratio, with a count of 3828 likes and 12581 dislikes (as of August 24th).   The elderly woman depicted in the original photograph is Nola Ochs, a 99 year old Kansas resident who graduated from Fort Hays State University (FHSU) in 2007 and broke the Guinness World Record for world's oldest college graduate at age of 95. Her record-setting graduation was covered by the U.S. news media, including MSNBC[1]. The first known instance of "Senior College Student" surfaced on July 31st, 2011 on the image macro application site Quickmeme[2]. Coinciding with the emergence of College Freshman series, most instances of Senior Freshman are centered around the premise of an older lady in a classroom who is eager to learn and share her personal experiences of the past. Susan Greenfield has claimed that the Internet and video games have been physically changing human brains, but is frequently criticized for having little to no evidence to back up her hypotheses. On August 3rd, 2011, she stated that digital technology may be leading to an increase in autism when challenged to provide evidence in an interview with New Scientist.[4] On August 6th, 2011, The Guardian[1] published an interview where she attempted to defend herself in the following quote: "I point to the increase in autism and I point to internet use. That's all. The same day the interview was published, science writer Carl Zimmer parodied the quotation in the following tweet: .bbpBox99965729314582528 {background:url(http://a3.twimg.com/profile_background_images/10210152/Twitter_page6.001.jpg) #e6ebc1;padding:20px;} p.bbpTweet{background:#fff;padding:10px 12px 10px 12px;margin:0;min-height:48px;color:#000;font-size:18px !important;line-height:22px;-moz-border-radius:5px;-webkit-border-radius:5px} p.bbpTweet span.metadata{display:block;width:100%;clear:both;margin-top:8px;padding-top:12px;height:40px;border-top:1px solid #fff;border-top:1px solid #e6e6e6} p.bbpTweet span.metadata span.author{line-height:19px} p.bbpTweet span.metadata span.author img{float:left;margin:0 7px 0 0px;width:38px;height:38px} p.bbpTweet a:hover{text-decoration:underline}p.bbpTweet span.timestamp{font-size:12px;display:block} I point to the increase in esophageal cancer and I point to The Brady Bunch.

The "Party Rock" shuffle is a loose interpretation of the Melbourne Shuffle, a rave and club dance that originated in the late 1980s in the underground rave music scene in Melbourne, Australia. The basic movements in the Shuffle consist of a fast heel-and-toe action with hand movements suitable for various types of electronic music. The Sad Guys on Trading Floors[1] blog was created on Tumblr by Kansas City-based interactive art director Chris Riebschlager and San Francisco-based blogger Jess Hemerly on October 7th, 2008, during the week that saw the largest percentage drop in history of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, even worse than any single week during the Great Depression in the United States, in the aftermath of the subprime mortgage crisis which began in 2007.[2][3] The first post on the site featured a dismayed-looking Asian daytrader with a facepalm gesture:      The phrase "waiting for OP" was used in the Democratic Underground[1] Forums as early as March 3rd, 2005. On December 29th, 2009, the earliest known image macro to use the phrase "OP will surely deliver" featuring a reclined skeleton (shown below) was uploaded to the image-hosting site Chan4Chan.[2]  After a thread titled Signature Series exposed became derailed, a user by the name Lloyd2k4 posted a pic of a whale with the whale saying "Do you like Whale?". The whale that was used was from a track from prob_alex named "A Whale's Tale".        Waffleman originated from the Facepunch thread "Another Possible Valve ARG", a thread discussing the "Found on the Tape" ARG, whose youtube channel uploaded two strange YouTube videos, including "Clip094.mp4," which contained an image of a severed head resting on a staircase, with a woman looking on. Several Facepunch users expressed their fear of that scene in the thread, until user brandonsh made this post in response to the image to make the image seem less scary.  "Untan" appeared in the 1st episode of K-On! 1st season which was first aired in Japan in April 3rd, 2009. The adorable girl playing castanets in this scene is Yui Hirasawa who is the protagonist of this series. According to Nico Nico Pedia[1], an internet encyclopedia for NND, Aki Toyosaki[2] who was the voice actor of Yui answered to an interview by a TV show that Untan was an ad lib by her. The original stock photo of the man sitting at the computer has been featured on several promotional webpages including Paperblog[7], Sodahead[8], My Ark Park[9] and WikiNoticia[10] (shown left). On July 30th, 2011, the first "Lonely Computer Guy" Quickmeme[15] submission was uploaded with the caption "That horse / is so amazing" (shown right), in reference to the Amazing Horse flash animation. The photo of the Cardboard Box Gundam was taken at Anime Central (ACEN) convention held in Rosemont, Illinois in May 2003. The homemade costume consisted entirely of a cardboard box with the word GUNDAM written on the front and exhaust ports drawn on the back the day the photo was taken.  The photo of Freddie Mercury raising his fist was taken during a Queen concert in Newcastle at St. James Park in 1986. Although the real photo is most likely from an official Queen book, Freddie Mercury can be seen making the pose at 13:38 in the video below from a different angle. Photographic and art prints of the pose, along with other poses from the same concert, can be purchased online on various websites such as Art.com[6], Art-Poster-Shop[7] and Amazon[4]. The photo appeared in the final panel of a Reddit f7u12 comic titled "Trying new things can lead to success"[1] posted by user CyberPope on July 19th, 2011. The comic was able to reach the front page with 6,198 up votes.  The earliest known instance using the character was posted by user "wberry" on Cuánto Cabrón on March 24th, 2011.[2] In the comic, a female friend compliments a boy's house to which he responds "no big deal" transforming into the "sir" character. The meme's origins can be traced to "Two Plus Two Poker Forums" in a post entitled "My Friend is a Douchebag (TR)". The original poster, cescfrabegas, complained of his friend cock-blocking him from sleeping with what he described as a "solid seven". An excerpt from the post is presented below[1]: "Aside from the fact he's screwin me outta getting laid this girl is like a solid 7 and he hasn't had any action for as long as i can remember. I say exactly this and he just kinda says "sorry bro not gonna happen". I try to make it happen with Jane anyway, but she ends up leaving and things are now kind of awkward with her. She was a semi-regular lay so at this point I'm pretty much steaming." The OP continued on with the post, latter adding that the thread was worthless without pics, and posting several images, including the picture shown in the thumbnail, his "solid 7" being on the left. After posting the rant, several members of the forum began to ridicule the OP and how his idea of a "solid 7" was unattractive.      The historical group known as Illuminati was founded by German philosopher Adam Weishaupt and four other members in Inglostady, Bavaria on May 1st, 1776. The society was made up of “free thinkers” of the enlightenment era who vowed to keep its existence a secret. The original Bavarian Illuminati was allegedly disbanded after Karl Theodor became ruler in 1777 and subsequently banned all secret societies. The first conspiracy theories surrounding the Illuminati surfaced in 1798, when authors Augustin Barruel and John Robison claimed the secret society had not disbanded and had played a role in causing the French Revolution. Contemporary theories typically state that the Illuminati has remained an unseen force in control of world leaders, celebrities and the media.  In the episode, Seto Kaiba creates a meme, lolcalization, to win a card game against the head of localization of his/ his father's company. Kaiba's opponent can destroy memes, and most of the cards in Kaiba's deck are memes. While distracting everyone with a flashback he creates the meme by posting a picture on the internet of a cat with a rice ball that says "I can haz rice ball?", turning his opponent into a meme and turning his opponent's strength against him. [1] [2] Kaiba gives an example of lolcalization by showing a screenshot of One Piece before and after editing, which is also part of the Invisible gun meme. This suggests that Invisible gun is now a part of lolcalization. On May 31st 2011 Youtube-user esoterradubstep uploaded a video of him lipdubbing Flux Pavillion's dubstepmix of 'Gold Dust' by DJ Fresh. This would be the first dubstep lipdub ever created. However, this was NOT the video that made dubstep mime recognisable. The video that did, was submitted on the same day, again by esoterradubstep. This time, it was 'Big Boss' by Doctor P that he made a lipdub of. It still took a while for the video to gain viewers. When eventually the video was embedded to The Daily What at July 15th, the views skyrocketed and the video was shared all over the web. All other dubstep mimes created by this user where uploaded rapidly afterwards. As of yet it is unknown why exactly THIS video made dubstep mime this popular. It might have been because this track is much more well-known, or because this track is pretty extreme, even for dubstep. This is being researched.       On July 20th, 2011, "PonPonPon" was released. On July 25th, 2011, Warner Music Japan released the song's music video, a psychedelic tribute to Kawaisa and Decora culture (shown below). "PonPonPon" quickly rose to the top of the iTunes charts in both Finland and Belgium. On July 31rd, 2011, the song entered Billboard Japan's Hot 100s chart at 72. During the Otakon 2011 held in downtown Baltimore, Maryland, attendees began blogging about a street vendor dubbed "Ice Cold Water Man," who was selling bottled water with a megaphone. While it's quite common to see street vendors selling water around the city, his unique approach and the memorable tagline "I've got that ice cold water-- and it's only one dollar--" captivated those who were attending the event. Throughout the week, his presence at the Baltimore Convention Center began to grow on the attendees and some uploaded video footage of "Ice Cold Water Man" via YouTube[1]. There are also YouTube videos of him taken from the previous conventions in 2009 and 2010.      “Because Racecar” started on January 26, 2011 on jalopnik.com’s off-topic forum “Opposite Lock.” The actual phrase came from a Craigslist posting for a Mazda MX-3, where in the description, the seller said the car has been modified “because race car.” [2] A screenshot of the original Craigslist posting. Jalopniks then started using the phrase as a sarcastic reply to any ridiculous question regarding cars. The picture from which this meme has been made was originally posted on an article in the dailymail.co.uk. On the article there were several pictures presenting a mother duck attempting to save her duckling from a heron.   According to the wiki page[7] on the humor site Weebl's Stuff, the original Breadfish flash animation[1] was uploaded to the site on September 20th, 2004. The identity of the original creator remains unknown. Tell me, have you seen the marvelous breadfish, swimming in the ocean waters? Have you seen that marvelous breadfish? It's like an inverse sandwich. An awe for fishermen and sharks. The animation bears many similarities to the tiled "Flying Toasters" After Dark screen saver.    The single topic blog "Spock is Not Impressed"[1] was launched on the microblogging site Tumblr on July 27th, 2011. The same day, a link to the blog was posted on Google Plus[2] by the site's creator Sean Bonner. The stillshot of Spock originally comes from a scene in the Season 2, Episode 15 of Star Trek: The Original Series titled “The Trouble With Tribbles”[3], in which Captain James Kirk laughs with his crew about an infestation of space pests. The episode originally aired on December 28th, 1967.  The phrase "thinking with portals" stems from the single-player first-person puzzle-platform video game Portal released by Valve in October 2007. The game primarily comprises a series of puzzles that must be solved by teleporting the player's character and simple objects using the "Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device,"[9] a special type of gun that can create inter-spatial portals between two flat planes. The game's unique physics allow momentum to be retained through portals, requiring creative use of portals. The phrase "Thinking with Portals" was first introduced in 2006 with the teaser trailer which ends with GLaDOS telling the viewer "now you're thinking with portals."    In the summer of 2011, Harvard Business School grads[1] Brian Thorne and Ed Foy uploaded photos of themselves creatively diving in to a pool to a private Facebook album. After realizing the images were a hit amongst their friends, on June 5th, they registered the domain name LeisureDive.com.[2] Two weeks later, they created a Facebook group[7], launching both on June 29th, 2012 with a handful of their own photographs. As of June 2013, the Leisure Dive Facebook fan page has more than 16,000 likes.  The Shake Weight was created by the company Fitness IQ in July of 2009, and was marketed as a fitness tool to reduce female arm flab. According to the Shake Weight website[1], the motion that the dumbbell produces is called "Dynamic Intertia": Shake Weight® Utilizes New Workout Technology Called Dynamic Inertia, which can increase Muscle Activity to nearly 300% compared to a Standard Dumbbell.     On June 29th, 2011, YouTuber Gzero91[1] posted a video asking other Garry's Mod users to send him clips of Valve character models dancing for "Project Flail: Dance." The final collaboration[8] of these submissions (shown left) was uploaded to Gzero91's YouTube channel on July 13th, 2011. Four days after the call for clips, YouTuber and Garry's Mod player FineLeatherJackets[2] uploaded his submission titled "Wanna Dance?" (shown right) featuring Team Fortress 2 character Red Heavy: Both the title of the series "Wanna Dance?" and the background music come from Afterlife Club, a nightclub on the mercenary-controlled space station Omega in Mass Effect 2. The title specifically comes from a specific cinematic sequence: A compilation of "Oh God Why" rage comics was posted to FunnyJunk[1] by user Diamondhead[2] on July 23rd, 2011. The post has received 99,167 views and 7407 up votes as of November 4th, 2011. Diamondhead claimed to be the creator of the "Oh God Why" character on his FunnyJunk profile page and revealed that he contributes to Reddit[3] under the username "ozzymustaine."   "Stop posting" is a commonly used phrase that has its root in Usenet newsgroups and discussion forum, where a participant may spam or flood the same post repeatedly and derail conversations. The earliest known instance of "Stop Posting" image macro appeared on October 21st, 2005 via Subchat Forum[1] where forum member Flatbush41 told another user AIM: The photograph of the student has been used as a generic stock image for various blog posts and advertisements as early as 2009, with articles like "Why Every College Freshman Should Start a Roth IRA" and "Focusing on Others Can Decrease Freshman Year Anxiety" posted via Jacobs Financial Group[1] and Mental Health News[9] in January and June 2010 respectively. The earliest known instance of the College Freshman image macro was shared on Reddit[20] on July 24th, 2011, with a caption poking fun at college sport Ultimate Frisbee:    Since the show's U.S. debut in March 2005, Dwight Schrute[12] (played by actor Rainn Wilson[7]) has become a breakout character for being a know-it-all with poor social skills and a worldview that can be best characterized as realist and survivalist. In the episodes, Schrute often corrects others' idiomatic statements by deeming them false and rebutting with real-life facts (shown below, left). Though he does not always say the word “false,” Schrute's distinct interpretation of English colloquialisms has been noted since the pilot season[18] and parodied by character Jim Halpert in a cold open of an episode during the show’s third season (shown below, right). While image macros using Dwight Schrute's likeness paired with actual quotes from the show appeared as early as February 2011 on FunnyJunk[5], the first image macro using the "Fact" format was created via Quickmeme[1] and uploaded to Reddit[2] on April 15th, 2011, where it received 1334 up votes. The caption featured Schrute's rebuttal to the lyrics of The Beatles' 1967 song “All You Need is Love” by asserting that a person only needs water and food to survive.     The original line was spoken by Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore, played by Robert Duvall, in the 1979 film Apocalypse Now. "Smell that? You smell that? Napalm, son. Nothing else in the world smells like that. I love the smell of napalm in the morning. You know, one time we had a hill bombed, for 12 hours. When it was all over, I walked up. We didn't find one of 'em, not one stinkin' dink body. The smell, you know that gasoline smell, the whole hill. Smelled like… Victory. Someday this war's gonna end…" This meme is from 2009. It started as a phrase “Омич полуёбок, скажи ты наркоман? я просто тоже где то там живу, могли бы вместе уёбывать наркотики.” (“Hey, half-fucker guy from Omsk, tell me, are you a junkie? Because I live here somewhere too, we could shoot drugs together.”) The phrase itself was a forced meme on 0chan.ru/b, but the word Омич (guy from Omsk) quickly became an euphemism for junkie. Then the place itself became associated with everything drug-induced or surreal. Various macros started to appear with “Welcome to Omsk” written on top of some surreal pictures like in “Picture unrelated”, and one of them featured the painting “Winged doom” by Heiko Müller. The recognizable central figure was dubbed “Omsk bird” and started to appear in fan-art. Heiko Müller became aware of the trend, initially misinterpreting it as if Omsk citizens have chosen it as a city mascot, but at some point he even participated in one of the winged doom threads. It is a curious trivia that the final version of stylized winged doom icon that is used in memegenerator was made by Heiko himself (he changed eye color from red to white).  The name "Chemistry Cat" has been previously given to LOLcat images, but the macro series only emerged in late July 2011. While the source of the image remains in veil, it is likely a stock photograph, possibly of Russian origin. A significant portion of the puns are actually derived from chemistry jokes that have been in circulation for awhile,[1] particularly in the context of K-12 education on chemistry and the periodic table. The earliest known instance of "Chemistry Cat" series can be found in a Reddit[2] thread posted on April 19th, 2011, of an image originating from the ICanHasCheezburger[6] blog:    The phrase originally appeared in 2006 in the first video of the Charlie the Unicorn series. It occurs at 1:20, when the two unnamed unicorns berate Charlie for not believing in Candy Mountain.      The word "legit" is a colloquial shortening of the adjective "legitimate", which was coined in the mid 15th century to mean "lawfully begotten" according to the Online Etymology Dictionary.[3] The term was popularized in 1991 with the release of the song "Too Legit to Quit" by rap artist MC Hammer. The earliest known sarcastic use of the phrase "sounds legit" online comes from a thread in the AnandTech[5] computer hardware review forums from November 11th, 2006. In the thread, the original poster asks if a certain online payment service is a scam, to which forum member jupiter57 replies "sounds legit to me!"     In 2002, photographer Kenneth Adelman took more than 12,000 photographs of the California coastline in an effort to document coastal erosion as part of the government-sanctioned California Coastal Records Project.[1] One of the photographs taken showed an aerial view of Barbara Streisand's Californian mansion[2]: According to the Californian Coast Line[3] official website, the organization received its first cease-and-desist letter from Streisand's attorney in February 2003, shortly after the launch of the site and the online gallery. A $50 million lawsuit was filed against the photographer and other suits were filed against the image hosting services Pictopia and Layer42 on May 20th, 2003.[4] The filing of lawsuits was soon reported in the news media, which inadvertently led more than 420,000 people to the website, according to the California Coast Line website.[7]  The original animated image was made by GIF artist BadEnd,[1] and the earliest upload of it can be found on Rule34, on April 1st, 2008.[3] (Viewer discretion is adviced when clicking the following image.) The first Tumblr posts referencing the spam appeared on July 22nd, 2011. The spam took the form of an anonymous Tumblr question, so only users with this feature enabled on their Tumblr accounts received the spam. On January 21st, 2002, the SpongeBob SquarePants episode "Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy IV" premiered in the United States. In the episode, SpongeBob ends up with Mermaid Man's utility belt and accidentally shrinks a pestered Squidward. He goes to his best friend Patrick for help, who explains that he has the belt set to 'M' for "Mini" when it should apparently be set to 'W' for "Wumbo". He then turns the 'M' upside-down and begins to explain the definition of the word "Wumbo" (seen in the following clip). On June 4th, 2004, the 3rd installment of the Harry Potter series, Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban was released (May 31, 2004 in the UK). In this movie, Severus Snape, played by Alan Rickman, enters his class in a hurry, closing the windows behind him,and telling the students to turn to page 394 in their books. Harry Potter then asks him why Professor Remus Lupin, who usually teaches the class isn't teaching the class. Snape answer by saying that it isn't his concern and reminds him to turn to page 394. The face first appeared in a comic titled “Rage Comic FFUU” (shown left) in which the harp darp face is criticized as being poorly drawn. The comic was submitted to the f7u12[1] subreddit by Redditor ULJarad[2] on May 11th, 2010. Several months later on October 11th, 2010, the phrase "harp darp" was used with the same rage face in another Reddit[12] post titled “Harp Darp poop on my car”, which featured a photo of a window with bird droppings with the face drawn over it (shown right). The original comes from the Nickelodeon TV series "Spongebob Squarepants" in the 44b episode called "The Idiot Box" aired on March 1st, 2002.[2] In the episode Spongebob utters the word "Imagination" while spreading his hands to create a rainbow (shown below).[1] Wikipedia's Description: SpongeBob and Patrick order a giant Television set just so that they can play in the box. They let Squidward have the TV, but when Squidward tells them their idea to play in the box is stupid, SpongeBob and Patrick deny this saying that imagination is better than Television. Squidward when he begins to leave begins to hear sound effects from the box as SpongeBob and Patrick play their "Imagination" games. Squidward asks them how is noise being made, but they deny being aware of this. They add that it is caused by "Imagination." Squidward begins to suspect later that they are using a tape recorder instead of their imaginations and so he comes into the box to find out what the sounds are caused by, but when he, Patrick, and SponeBob imagine "Robot-Pirate Island" the sounds are not heard. Squidward still believes that there is a tape recorder or anything that makes sound and so he sneaks into the box at night and imagines himself as a race car driver and he hears the sounds, but a garbage truck confuses the box to be garbage and it takes it to the dump with Squidward inside. In an epilogue, SpongeBob and Patrick go outside the next day to find their box gone, and so they decide to go to visit Squidward instead.  Minecraft is a popular Sandbox game originally released on May 17th, 2009. At the beginning of the game, the player starts with no tools or weapons but bare hands. To get started, the player must gather the wood blocks by literally punching down a tree. The humor is derived from the fact that in real life, it is extremely difficult to bring down a tree with bare hands.  The metaphor of bleaching one's brain has been previously illustrated in popular TV shows and films through colloquial expressions like "poking one's eye out" or "flossing one's brain." Such phrases have been quoted on numerous occasions through popular TV sitcoms like Cheers, Fraiser and Friends in the 1990s. The online practice of sharing awesome images as a way to cope with post-traumatic stress most likely began on popular image boards and forums where users are prone to share gross or shocking content, such as 4chan, SomethingAwful and FARK. The earliest documentation of the term can be found in a YTMND[1] site titled "pass the eye bleach!" originally posted in October 2005. The earliest Urban Dictionary[2] entry on "eye bleach" was submitted on September 5th, 2007. A similar definition entry for "Brain Bleach"[3] was submitted on November 1st, 2007, which was later chosen by the editorial staff as the "Urban Word of the Day" on June 28th, 2009. JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is a manga written and illustrated by Hirohiko Araki.[1] The series began in 1987 and still continues nowadays (as of August 2011), with over 100 volumes divided into 8 major story arcs. Best known for its musical references, grotesque style of visual art and highly overdramatic character poses. The franchise has been since adapted into other formats of Original Video Animation, films, novels, videogames and fashion merchandises.         In Mass Effect 2, it becomes common practice to check up on characters after completing an important mission to see whether they have anything new to say.[1] Because Garrus' events and conversations take a longer time to trigger than other characters, he will usually say the featured line, "Can it wait? I'm in the middle of some calibrations," more often than not when the player attempts a conversation.  Cyberbu//y is an ABC Family original movie about a girl named Taylor Hillridge, who, soon after receiving her own computer, becomes a victim of cyberbullying on a popular social networking site known as "cliquester". In one scene, Taylor attempts to commit suicide after having been tormented by online bullies after her "cliquester" account is hacked. She posts a video online explaining her suicide. She is caught in the act of attempting suicide before downing a bottle of pills. She then exclaims, "I CAN'T GET THE CAP OFF", while her friend walks in on her in the bathroom, trying to twist the cap off on a bottle of pills.       On March 1st, 1973, Pink Floyd released the album The Dark Side of the Moon.[1] The album's cover prism design (shown below) was inspired by a photograph that Thorgerson had seen during a brainstorming session with Powell. The artwork was created by their associate, George Hardie. Hipgnosis offered the band a choice of seven designs, but all four members agreed that the prism was by far the best. The design represents three elements; the band's stage lighting, the album lyrics, and Richard Wright's request for a "simple and bold" design. The spectrum of light continues through to the gatefold--an idea that Waters came up with. Added shortly afterwards, the gatefold design also includes a visual representation of the heartbeat sound used throughout the album, and the back of the album cover contains Thorgerson's suggestion of another prism recombining the spectrum of light, facilitating interesting layouts of the sleeve in record shops. The light band emanating from the prism on the album cover has six colors, missing indigo compared to the traditional division of the spectrum into red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet.[2] While cover parodies likely existed before, on Febraury 15th, 2000, the band the Squirrels released an album-length parody of the record entitled The Not-So-Bright Side of the Moon.[3] The album's cover featured the prism of light coming out of Squirrels-vocalist Rob Morgan's head. The fad's origin stems from December 20th, 2010 when YouTube user DWL1993[2] uploaded the video "Elektro Boxx" which uses audio samples from Boxxy's famous Vlog's as the "swarce". The phrase "It's Salmon!!!" comes from the 1st episode in the anime series which was produced byu Kyoto Animation and was aird from April 2011 to September 2011, and it was shouted by one of the main characters in the anime Yuko Aioi when she was struck her head by a fillet of raw salmon fallen from the sky.   With the Valve's announcement that the online FPS Team Fortess 2 is now free to play, Valve also released the so expected "Meet the medic" video after a two year hiatus. As well as the others "Meet the" series, the original video achieved great popularity among Team Fortress players. "Gotta Go Fast" is the title of the theme song from the English version of the Sonic the Hedgehog anime series, Sonic X[10], which aired from 2003 – 2006. While the phrase had been used in more serious fan art since as early as 2004[11], became associated with a piece of poorly drawn fan art as early as 2008, when it was posted to the YouChew forums[1] in a thread discussing the art available in the gallery on the now-defunct official fan site Sonic Central.[12] It is unknown who originally drew it. On January 26th, a poster named Cortes shared the image in the thread, noting it was a repost. Other posters began quoting the image, commenting on the poor quality of the art. The original photo was posted to the Dutch message board FOK![10] in July 2007 after one of the users had been contacted by the man through a social networking site under his pseudonym "Ansswa." Many people on the forum began sharing his photos and editing them to poke fun at him. The following month, another user had received a message from him as well.[11] On November 17th, 2008, another thread[12] was posted revealing “Ansswa” was a nickname for Mehmet Ordu[13], a Turkish pimp who had just been arrested with his partner Murat for running a prostitution ring.      A thread was posted to Reddit[1] on July 11th, 2011, entitled "Seems to be an increase in planking photos, so…" featuring a demotivational stye image macro of a woman perched on railing with the caption "OWLING because planking is so two months ago". The earliest thread for Shōei parody collage in /news4vip/ board was found on February 1st, 2009, and its title was "It took 1h 20min to put a school swimsuit on Shōei by Photoshop" (Japanese : フォトショで照栄にスク水着せてたら1時間20分たってた)[2]. This thread was for answering to a man who tried making Shōei collages by himself and gave up it in before. Then, around the summer of 2009, some people following the approach of this thread in this board began to make a thread for requesting Shōei collages with eccentric theme such as these: - "Please give me the picture of Shōei destroying a wardrobe in tears." - "Please give me the picture of Shōei searching a remote in tears." - "Please give me the picture of Shōei throwing himself against a fire truck in tears." These were simple joke, and most of their requests had been ignored. However, around the beginning of 2011, the number of people who challenged to the theme began increasing gradually. Because of their works, the popularity of Shōei collages became increasing in this board.    On June 28th, 2011, a girl named Alex posted a video of herself on her "My Fancy Sauce" Tumblr[1] page. The video featured a brief monologue explaining that she is about to perform what she thinks will attract the opposite sex like "being dumb and a slut". She proceeds to cover her face in a thick coat of bronzer, lipstick, and dumps water on her head while dancing around saying "do you like me now?", "What's 2 plus 2? Gonorrhea", "Myspace Pic" and "I'm a good time cause I like to drink."      The phrase was inspired by Tentacle Erotica or shokushu goukan (触手強姦) in Japanese, often seen in a type of Japanese cartoon pornography known as "hentai" (Japanese for "pervert"). The first known use of the phrase comes from an animated GIF made from a scene where Batman is battling Poison Ivy in the 1992 cartoon Batman: The Animated Series. According to Google image search[4], the image was posted frequently between June and July of 2011.   On June 5th, 2011, severe rainstorms hit the coast of Jamaica, including the rural parish towns of St. Andrew and St. Thomas, where a bridge was swept away by the flooding of Yallahs River. A local news team from Television Jamaica was dispatched in the region to interview the local residents on the scene and among them was an optimistic, outspoken community member who identified himself as Clifton Brown. Notable quotes: Clifton's unique "twang" accent, a pejorative term for the British-like dialect of English spoken by Jamaicans who grew up speaking heavy patwa but wish to "clean up" by sounding more akin to the British pronunciations, inspired DJ Powa to create a musical remix and upload it via YouTube on June 15th, 2011.   Director of YouTube's Next Lab, Timothy Shey, created the first fake Hangout with a post[1] that read "Tim Shey is not hanging out with you right now" on July 7th, 2011. The act of flipping a table out of anger has been typically associated with portrayal of frustrated fathers and husbands in fiction and TV shows as well as manga and anime series. In Japan, the trope is known as Flipping Tables or Return Tea Table (ちゃぶ台返し, Chabudai Gaeshi) which has been illustrated through characters like Ittetsu Hoshi in the 1968 manga/anime series “Star of the Giants” and Kantaro Terauchi from the 1975 sitcom series “Terauchi Kantaro’s Family." The original instance and its first appearance on the web remains unknown, but the text-based emoticon most likely emerged in the early 1990s, along with the general style now we know as Japanese emoticons.   ">mfw" threads first began appearing on 4chan's imageboards in late 2009, with the earliest archived thread dating back to November 29th, 2009 in the /mu/ (music) thread "Syd"[1].  News reports and rumors about the declining health of Jiang first surfaced as early as in December 2010, when the 84-year-old leader of the Chinese Communist Party took absence from the funeral of former Chinese foreign minister Huang Hua.  Redditor Saydrah posted a thread on the AskReddit[1] subreddit titled "Hey Reddit, I'm Redditing from the Denver International Airport and I see a lot of people on laptops around using the free wifi. Just on the offchance, any fellow Redditors here?" on August 7th, 2009. In the thread description field, Saydrah described her attempts at finding Redditors at the Denver International Airport. Redditor FreakinWolfy replied saying, "'The narwhal bacons at midnight' is now the official phrase to identify yourself as a redditor." It received 661 points making it the top voted comment in the thread. After witnessing the real-life game Bigger, Better[2], which requires players to barter common objects for physically bigger and subjectively better ones, canadian Kyle MacDonald began trading items on localized classifieds site Craigslist.org.[3] His first trade involved a red paperclip being exchanged for a fish-shaped pen.   The scene originates from House season 5, episode 22 ("House Divided")[2], which aired on April 27 2009. In the episode, a young and deaf wrestler is treated after experiencing "Exploding Head Syndrome". After being inspired by an hallucination, Dr.House (played by Hugh Laurie) enters the patient's room holding a boombox which plays "Fight the Power" by Public Enemy.[3] This later helps House prove that the patient has Pneumonia. The first parody of the scene, titled ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWAH, was posted via YouTube on January 11th, 2010, which replaces Public Enemy's song with "Libera Me From Hell" from Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann and House's signature glasses with the iconic Kamina Glasses. Over a year later, another parody titled "Elektro House" was uploaded on July 3rd, 2011, using a remix version of Public Enemy's "Fight The Power" with Brooklyn Bounce vs. Sample Rippers – Louder & Prouder (Picco Elektro Remix). "Elektro House" was originally also a response to the Elektro X YTPMV fad. Within one week, the video gained 40,000 views. The video also loops Dr. House dancing to make it longer. Online use of the phrase "nailed it" in a sarcastic manner has appeared since as early as March 5th, 1998 in a discussion on the alt.sports.basketball.nba.boston-celtics newsgroup[9] comparing the demeanors of players Ron Mercer and Antoine Walker. After poster HelzWrath suggested that their different personalities were attributed to the places in which they were raised, another poster nicknamed V.L.L. took offense to it. Helzwrath felt like V.L.L. had missed the post's point, responding sarcastically with "you nailed it." Hey. If you're not smart enough to know that someone's environment affects their personality, then I'm sorry. I take it then, that you think a person from Beverly Hills is no different than someone from Harlem? Ok, just so I know.      The image appeared for the first time from the blogging website Lawrence of Cyberia[1] on January 12th, 2004. The title and description of the post were "Ugly Americans" and "Why do they call us that?" Below the image, there was then specified the location and date in which the event took place, which stated, "A U.S. woman and supporter of the Israeli security barrier shouts at an Israeli peace activist in Jerusalem on January 2, 2004. (REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun)" (shown below). The earliest example of the image being used in a meme comes from a post on November 7th, 2009, on Fark,[2] which was posted in a thread by user qwertypoo. The photo mimics the style of a Demotivational Poster with the caption "America, it's kind of like this" (seen below).  The original picture of Retard Girl comes from an article on topnews.us . The article was made on November 19, 2009. It was about Down Syndrome and showed this picture: In 2010, the website MemeGenerator took the picture and put a rainbow background. Thus making it an Advice Animal.   Nintendo released the first Pokémon games in the United States, Red Version and Blue Version[4], on September 28th, 1998. As the player walks through tall grass in the game, they have the ability to encounter wild monsters to catch for their team. In the original bundle of Red and Blue, the message "Wild X Appeared!" appeared each time the player encountered a Pokemon character during gameplay. In subsequent releases, the wording was changed to “A wild X appeared!” Though the phrasal template typically follows the present tense form of “A wild X appears!,” this particular wording has been never used in the Pokémon series.  On MSNBC's "Morning Joe", On June 30 2011, Mark Halperin made a televised apology to President Obama after Halperin said Obama acted like "a dick" during a recent press conference. During Halperin's apology, he was inexplicably accompanied by a silent, glaring, Willie Geist, co-host of Morning Joe. The memetic possibilities of Geist's stare were first demonstrated on the June 30th episode of "The Daily Show" in which the "disapproving glare" was analyzed and the image was overlayed on apologies made by Former NY Representative Anthony Weiner, Tiger Woods, Former NY Governor Eliot Spitzer, President Bill Clinton, President Richard Nixon, and a scene from "Blair Witch Project." Stewart described the glare as "a perfect mix of disappointment, it has a dash of sadness, a smidgen of disbelief, all with just a hint of 'Why the f**k am I in this shot?!'" Daily Show: Mark Halperin Calls Obama a Dick Shortly after, pictures started showing up with Willie Geist's stare in them. And within two hours of the episode of the Daily Show showing, the first video of the meme was uploaded to YouTube by the user YourMomBakesPies titled "WILLIE GEIST DOES NOT APPROVE"  On June 2nd, 2008, Buckley posted a strip titled "Loss,"[2] in which the female lead Lilah suffers a miscarriage. The strip marked a significant change in tone from the usually comedic comic, and the poorly-executed drama of the comic spurred Ctrl+Alt+Del's significant anti-fandom to mockery.  The game was mostly created entirely by the artist / programmer Donitz, with the music composed by CRTified Technician, Zero V2 and DarkNES. The game was made for a Creepypasta game competition on the My Little Pony focused gaming site Equestria Gaming[1], inspired by the popularity of the Luna Game series. Donitz posted the game to his Deviantart on July 1st 2011[2], and on Newgrounds on the 2nd[3], which has received over 200,000 views so far. Donitz went on to win the contest.  Originally released in 1996 for Microsoft Windows 95, Gmask[1] allows its users to obscure images using a variety of effects, including spirals, vertical lines, photo negative, vertical glass and horizontal glass. The earliest archived Gmask post on 4chan[10] was submitted to a thread featuring the Flea Market Montgomery commercial in the /b/ (random) board on May 8th, 2008 (shown below).   The colloquial expression "true story" has been used as an affirmative statement to corroborate one's claim or allegation. Online, one of the earliest archived instances of this was posted on three separate Usenet newsgroups on November 2nd, 1995.[9] The post contained a diatribe criticizing the logic of seasoned posters who were complaining about an influx of newbies to Usenet. As an aside, author David Sewell used an example from his real life with a "true story" disclaimer, comparing the actions of a professor complaining about a student playing loud music to the way the older Usenet users were acting towards newcomers. An Urban Dictionary[3] definition for the phrase used in this manner was submitted nearly ten years later on June 20th, 2004. “True Story” gained much of its catchphrase status through the character Barney Stinson from the TV sitcom series How I Met Your Mother[1], which began airing in 2005. Throughout the show, Stinson frequently uses the expression “True Story” as an ending to theories or stories that are for the most part probably false or nonsense.        The blog Hyperbole and a Half[1] published a comic titled "This is Why I'll Never be an Adult" by artist Allie Brosh on June 17th, 2010. The comic describes the author's frustration with her inability to maintain a consistent enthusiasm for her daily responsibilities. The following two panels were part of the comic: Derivatives often use one of these two images. Freaky was created after Tom of Extreme Costumes[2] and Jay Lichtenberger of RIPFILMS collaborated to designed a character for the RIPFILMS Series, After creating Freaky, Brain Medeiros from RedHeadFlute operated Freaky for RIPFILMS and TheScarySnowman[3] Freaky The Scary Snowman got his start on February 5th 2011 on Season 1 Episode 6 of RIPFILMS on YouTube.com, gaining 100,000 views in 2 weeks. Tom also gives a run through on how to build your own Freaky on his Extreme Costumes Channel.  Nickelodeon's animated TV series The Wild Thornberrys[8] premiered in September 1998 and reran on various regional broadcasts in 2000s. In the show, Sir. Nigel Archibald Thornberry (voiced by English actor Tim Curry) is portrayed as a quirky, adventurous wildlife documentarian who often rambles in indiscernible English accent. Prior to the introduction of Nigel audio remixes, the character has been previously subject to video parodies, most notably through the medium of YouTubePoop remixes. The original Nigel remix featuring Katy Perry's 2010 single "Firework" was uploaded by Sam Antonioli, who goes by the handle BitCrunch[1], and posted on his personal Tumblr blog[2] on June 25th, 2011.   The drawing of the ghost was originally posted on June 28th, 2011 to 4chan's /b/ (random) board[1], where it generated over 200 image replies with captions placed over the original artwork. Probably my last bump. Pic unrelated. While the original artist's name is unknown, he or she began posting additional drawings of the Horrifying Houseguest to a personal Tumblr[13] on July 12th, 2011.  The line was first used in the original first video game in the series by the character Barry Burton who, after saving protagonist Jill Valentine from a descending ceiling trap, where he snarkily remarks that his partner was nearly turned into "a Jill-Sandwich". The line can be found at 0:36 in the above video. While the phrase "I can't fap to this" is rumored to have originated on the imageboard 4chan, the earliest known posting was submitted by Fark[3] commenter KickahaOta on September 10th, 2008, in response to a rare photograph of British social reformer Florence Nightingale (shown below).       The meme originates from episode 20, "Green Isn't Your Color".[2] A sub-plot of the episode features Pinkie Pie[1] continuously appearing in physically impossible contexts (from boxes, buckets, and inside a mirror) to tell Twilight Sparkle that "breaking a friend's trust is the fastest way to lose a friend, FOREVER!", in reference to secrets that Twilight Sparkle's friends had entrusted her with.  Doctor Whooves' notability began with episode 11, "Winter Wrap Up", which aried on December 24th, 2010. The original thread was made by an Anonymous user in 4chan's[1] /co/ board on December 10, 2010 in anticipation of the coming episode, and referred to the character as "My Little Time Lord". Doctor Whoof can be sighted at 3:32 in the episode: Doctor Whooves can also be spotted in episode 16 of the series titled "Sonic Rainboom", that aired on February 18th, 2011. The character was a Pegasus contestant for the Best Young Flyer Competition in Cloudsdale. There is also another variation of Doctor Whooves appearing at 4:22 in the season one finale "The Best Night Ever", that aired on May 6th, 2011. Some fans describe him as the fifth incarnation of Doctor Who citing a resemblance to Peter Davison. Some claim that this version of Doctor Whooves resembles the eleventh incarnation of The Doctor due to his bow tie. Others view him as The Master, The Doctor's nemesis and renegade Time Lord. The ninth episode of the second season, "Sweet and Elite", also showed various versions of Doctor Whooves attending to a party. The variations being another version of Peter Davison as the fifth incarnation, the eleventh incarnation resembling Matt Smith, and the third incarnation of The Doctor resembling Jon Pertwee.   Upside Down Fuel is a meme born on the /r/gaming subreddit on the website Reddit. It began when a user "iufreak" posted a picture title "Screw you, Fuel.". It consisted of a stack of Xbox 360 games, one of them being Fuel. Fuel's spine image was upside down, compared to the other games. More posts began to appear, one being a Steam game library, with Fuel being photoshopped to be upside down. The meme grew more when website www.playr2.com changed it's Fuel page title to be upside down. The entertainment news blog US Weekly[6] published a post titled "Rob Pattinson Swims in Underwear With Bikini-Clad Kristen Stewart" on December 2nd, 2010, featuring a photograph of Pattinson in mid-air while jumping off a dock (shown below, left). The "Fuck Yeah Jumping Rob" Tumblr[1] blog was launched on November 14th, with its first post featuring Strutting Leo edited into the frame of the Pattinson photo (shown below, right). The comic that started the fad is currently unknown, but the earliest documented derivative[1] was created on May 11th, 2011 on Reddit. Although the rhyming fad began sometime in early May, even back in March of 2011 on Funnyjunk[2] and on Reddit[3] there were images utilizing the phrase “She wants my dick” in combination with the OMG Rage Face. But, although they do use the correct face and phrase, these aren’t considered part of the fad as they don’t contain anyone asking them for an item. The earliest known discussion about the term "wingboner" started in an IRC chatroom[1] about a fanmade comic in which Rainbow Dash is pinning Twilight Sparkle, who reacts by kissing Rainbow Dash, giving Rainbow Dash a wingboner. This led some fans to hypothesize that pegasi have an involuntary response to sexual stimulation, namely the flaring of wings. Entitled "Valentine's day", the comic was drawn by DeviantART user TwilightFlopple[2] who has drawn a great deal of My Little Pony-related fan art. The image of the background character, whose fan-given nickname is Lyra Heartstrings, stems from a scene in Season 1, Episode 7 titled "Dragonshy," (shown below) which first aired on November 26th, 2010. Sitting Lyra was first mentioned on 4chan's /co/ (cartoon) board on November 26th, 2010, the same day as the original air date. An anonymous user posted a screenshot of the scene where Lyra appears on the bench.[1]  On May 24th, 2011, President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama paid a visit to the Queen of England at the Buckingham Palace.[1] During the presidential couple's first state visit to the United Kingdom, a peculiar photograph of the couple looking rather startled was taken by a Reuters photojournalist. The Obamas' summit with the British royal family was widely covered by the British news media and the photograph was featured two days later as "Picture of the Day" by The Telegraph.[10] On the May 26th, 2011, Redditor joeyjoejoe99 posted a rage comic on the f7u12 subreddit called "Not Bad Obama."[2] The multi-pane comic strip depicted Computer Reaction Guy photoshopping the news photograph into a rage comic reaction face and being satisfied with the result, accompanied by the caption in red letters "Not Bad." Later that day, a version of the first lady Michelle Obama's O RLY face was posted by Redditor thrsdy titled "Not Bad, Michelle".[3]    The meme originates from a 1998 commercial for Windows 98. The music played is a condensed version of "Ludwig's Boogey" from KT5's "Hi-Tech Volume 1" album. Notice that each clip changes after almost every note of the song. Prior to the introduction of cinemagraph, similar animated GIFs were posted to the Three Frames Tumblr[14] blog as early as April 30th, 2009. A style of animated GIF known as a "wigglegram" was created that uses stereoscopy techniques to make an image appear as if it is 3D (shown left below). The first known animated GIF to use cinemagraph techniques like masking and looping was posted via the Tumblr blog "If We Don't, Remember Me"[1] on October 30th, 2010. The image (shown right above) featured a scene from the 1980 psychological horror film The Shining starring Jack Nicholson. While the artist behind the face is still unknown, the first instance of it appeared in a rage comic, depicting a conversation about the character's wife going to her boss' house to test Sony Playstation 3 games. After his friend explains that the console does not have any games, the face is used to express the realization that he had been fooled. The comic was posted online as early as October 1st, 2009 on the Studio Kat forums[1] in a thread to share absurd images. Between the release of The Legend of Zelda[5] in February 1986 and February 2013, Nintendo has released fifteen titles in the main series, five of which were later enhanced and rereleased, and thirteen spin-off games.[6] According to the Zelda Wiki[2], Nintendo's unconventional philosophy of "Gameplay first, story later" served well in the beginning, but the chronology became increasingly complex and incoherent as additional titles were released. In the early 2000s, Nintendo of America posted a timeline[7] of the games on the official website Zelda.com, which provided a coherent progression of the stories leading up to the 2001 Game Boy titles Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons. However, this official explanation was eventually vetoed by the game's Japanese developers who wanted to keep the timeline open to subjective interpretation of the players.  On June 19th, 2011, an image of Sweetie Derelle was posted to Ponychan's /oat/ board[1] as a reaction face. Other users began commenting on it, and the entire thread was filled with reposts and variations of the original image.  According to the tech blog Bit_Synthesis[4] published a post titled "Datamoshing – the Beauty of Glitch," the practice of datamoshing had been used by digital artists since at least 2005. In 2006, a technique created by artists Betrand Planes and Christian Jacquemin transcodes one lossy video format into another was demonstrated with the modified DivX video codec DivXPrime.[2][3] One of the first known videos of the mashup was made by youtube account XlovesMiku (MatrixMariox alternative account) which features a sparta remix set to the song Harder Better Faster Stronger, although the video has been since deleted due to the account being terminated. Some time later a second remix by the same account was made, featuring the same Daft Punk song set to the song What is love? the video was reuploaded on Nov 14, 2010 by pigeonmaster77  The original image was created in 1989 by a pair of students at the Rhode Island School of Design named Shepard Fairey and Ryan Lesser while practicing stenciling techniques, which they then proceeded to stick all over Rhode Island. It was from there picked up by the skating community, who helped it to become a viral phenomenon all across the United States. The image eventually became a subject of lawsuit due to the name "Andre the Giant" still being under copyright, forcing the creators to stop producing their own versions, leading to the creation of an alternate "OBEY" poster, which has also been parodied, although not as extensively. Interestingly, Shepard Fairey later went on to become the designer of the famous Barack Obama 'Hope' Poster. On June 15th, 2011 the 7th game of the 2011 Stanley Finals between the Boston Bruins and the Vancouver Canucks was held in Vancouver's Rogers Arena. Boston beat Vancouver 4-0, giving Boston the series win at 4-3. Shortly before the ending of the 7th game, angry Vancouver fans created riots in the streets.[1] For more background information about the riots, read KYMdb – 2011 Vancouver Stanley Cup Riot. On June 16th, Twitter user @AndersKravis[2] tweeted the original photo of the angry rioter: .bbpBox81353457600172032 {background:url(http://a0.twimg.com/profile_background_images/224779515/AKbg.jpg) #ffffff;padding:20px;} p.bbpTweet{background:#fff;padding:10px 12px 10px 12px;margin:0;min-height:48px;color:#000;font-size:18px !important;line-height:22px;-moz-border-radius:5px;-webkit-border-radius:5px} p.bbpTweet span.metadata{display:block;width:100%;clear:both;margin-top:8px;padding-top:12px;height:40px;border-top:1px solid #fff;border-top:1px solid #e6e6e6} p.bbpTweet span.metadata span.author{line-height:19px} p.bbpTweet span.metadata span.author img{float:left;margin:0 7px 0 0px;width:38px;height:38px} p.bbpTweet a:hover{text-decoration:underline}p.bbpTweet span.timestamp{font-size:12px;display:block} Dear Vancouver, we should all be so proud… good luck trying to hide with pics like this online. #canucksriot http://twitpic.com/5cbwwgless than a minute ago via Twitpic Favorite Retweet ReplyAnders KravisAndersKravis @AndersKravis denies being the original photographer, however.  The videos began to spread after one Youtube user, shirtsareoverrated, pointed out the several occurances of the scream in the newest HP7p2 trailer. There are a total of 5 Voldemort screams in the first trailer: Another 5 screams can be heard while watching the film's other trailer:  The origin of the photo of the girl comes from a post on the single topic blog HottestGirlsOnCampus, entitled "North Carolina Hat Girl"[1], posted on the 26th of January 2011. Soon afterward, the subject of the photograph was identified as a winner of CollegeHumor's "Hottest College Girl" contest in 2007.[9] The earliest known instance of the "Chicken Nuggets" caption can be found in a YouTube video uploaded on September 21st, 2006, featuring an image of Serious Cat, a well-known LOLcat that became popular around the same time, and a voicedub ranting about the absence of chicken nuggets.  According to Wikipedia[1], Milk bags had been widely used in the United Kingdom, Canada and several Eastern European countries during the Cold War, but began to decline in popularity after the emergence of Tetra Pak and plastic bottles in the early 1990s. "The Canadian Milk Bag,"[2] the earliest known website dedicated to the topic, was created by S.K.Y sometime in 2004. According to the site description, it was intended as an educational pamphlet for non-Canadians who are unfamiliar with the concept of packaging milk in plastic bags: I think the most irritating thing of all time (Next to maybe Adam Sandler) is when you’re in the middle of a conversation and you happen to mention milk bags, and the other person is like “WHAT IS A MILK BAG?”, and you try to explain what it is, and how exactly it works but the concept is still a very hard one for them to grasp. So I have decided to take the liberty upon myself and make a site with all the possible milk bag information which can be jammed packed into one web space (10 megs). My goal is when a person is done looking through this website, to have them completely and utterly educated on everything milk bags related. "Fire in the hole!" was first introduced as one of several drive-through pranks documented in the "Camp Kill Yourself Trilogy: Round 1" video[1], filmed in 1999 by Brandon DiCamillo. In English-speaking countries, "fire in the hole" is a warning call used to indicate that an explosive detonation in a confined space is imminent. According to Wikipedia[2], the phrase originated with miners who needed to warn their fellows that a charge had been set.       On June 12th, 2011, popular webcomic blog MS Paint Adventure[1] published an issue of Homestuck, one of the pages featuring an oddly drawn Karkat wandering off in the distance, appearing as if his shirt and trousers blended together into one piece.  Princess Celestia is a recurring character in My Little Pony Friendship is Magic. She and her sister, Princess Luna, were the supreme rulers of Equestria, and were tasked with raising the sun and the moon respectively. Luna became jealous of Celestia because ponies played throughout the day, but slept during the night. One night Luna refused to lower the moon, thereby threatening Equestria with eternal night. Celestia banished her to the moon, leaving herself responsible for raising both the sun and the moon each day and night. After the events in the first two episodes, which take place a thousand years after Luna's initial banishment, Celestia goes back to ruling the land of Equestria with Princess Luna raising the moon again.[1] Throughout the series, there are times when Celestia speaks and behaves somewhat less formally than would be expected of a princess or an absolute monarch. On May 18th, 2009, Australian comedian Alki Stevens uploaded a video (shown below, left) containing a series of pranks and stunts he and his friends had done in public, such as ordering at a drive-through while wearing a mask and purposefully falling while carrying a tray full of food inside a fast food restaurant. In one scene, Stevens is shown pulling up to a drive-through window, where the server hands him a soft-serve ice cream cone. With a straight face, Stevens grabs it by the ice cream and drives away. Just under a year later, Stevens uploaded a second video featuring several more instances of cone-ing. However, the fad did not take off until he uploaded a third video titled "CONE-ING IS THE NEW PLANKING" (shown above, right) on June 5th, 2011. As of October 2012, this video has more than 9.1 million views and more than 923,000 combined Twitter and Facebook shares.[13]   The template image was created from a stock image of a man washing his face (shown below, left), which has often been used in skin care ads and blog posts.[6] The origin of the outline image (shown below, right) is unknown but is rumored to have been posted in the /b/ (random) board on 4chan sometime in 2011.  The original picture of the cat was posted in early 2005 on a Korean lulz community Humor University[1]. Paired with a picture of a celebrity DJ/rapper Jae Young[2], the XY comparative macro revealed a bizarre resemblance between the two. Instantly captivated by the cat's seriousness and celebrity likeness, Humor University netizens dubbed it Jae-Young Cat[3] and spread the image across the Korean web, including DCInside[4], RuliWeb[5] and Today Humor[6]. Later that year, Jae Young Cat and one of its derivative images[7] were featured as the most reblogged images on Naver.com, a portal search engine site.       The first and most known TV commercial for Nerunerunerune was this video starring an old witch, and it drew the candy as something like a witch's secret elixir comically. Transcript: From 1984 to 1990s, this commercial was frequently aired in TV programs for children sponsored by Bell Foods. So, this witch and the sound of "Telettele" was very memorable scene for many kids at that time. Since 2000s, the airing of first commercial was ended, and a witch didn't appear on the next commercial. But, witch appeared for the first time in a decade in the new commercial for Nerunerunerune began to air in February 2011. This version own the essence of the first version such as "Telettele" sound.  Although Kanye West's 2010 single "Power" had been used in a TV Spot for the movie The Social Network in July 2010, it wasn't until E3 2011 that it became a popular in YouTube mash-ups. During E3, two game trailers were presented that used the audio track:      The source footage for this series is a scene of the 500km wide meteorite impact from Miracle Planet, a TV program aired between 2004 and 2005 (shown below, left).[1] The earliest MAD video featuring this asteroid collision was posted by MAD creator "checkit014" (チェキ14歳) to his website around February 2007 (shown below, right).[2] This was a part of his parody video series on MMORPG Ragnarok Online.[3] The video titled "eHarmony Video Bio[9]" was uploaded by YouTuber hartmanncara on June 3rd, 2011. In it, a young, timid woman "Debbie" begins her monologue explaining that it is her first attempt at creating an online dating profile video. Less than a full minute into the video, "Debbie" suddenly hits a wall of emotions and becomes teary-eyed, professing how much she loves cats. By December 2011, the video has accrued over 18 million views. The original image comes from a stock photo titled "Man working at computer with sad woman in background" (shown below, left) that can be found on Gettyimages[1] and Fotosearch.[2] The earliest occurance on Reddit was on May 18th, 2011, in a thread titled "The door swings both ways" (shown below, right).[3] The post was made as a response to another Reddit thread titled "I must admit I've thought of this myself" featuring the following image of a man lying awake in bed (shown below).[4] It was not referred to as "Redditor's Wife" until May 20th 2011 in an image posted to the /r/AdviceAnimals subreddit. [5] In the advice animal kingdom, thick-rimmed glasses were first incorporated into Hipster Jesus and Hipster Kitty (shown left) image macros in 2009 to symbolize their pretentious character. In 2010, it was adapted into another image macro series known as Hipster Ariel (shown right). For the complete list of image macro memes associated with thick rimmed glasses, check out KYM Category – Hipster Glasses.    In the Season 2, Episode 6 episode of Futurama titled "The Lesser of Two Evils", Fry can be seen making the face shortly after being found searching Leela's underwear drawer at around 15 minutes into the episode.[1] This still image was first used in a I See What You Did There derivative: On June 6th, 2011, Sony demoed the video game Medieval Moves: Deadmund's Quest for the Playstation Move motion-sensing game controller platform at the E3 conference. During the presentation, Zindagi Games President Umrao Mayer repeatedly gave demonstrator Jeremy Ray various words of encouragement, including "nice shot, Jeremy," "Great job, Jeremy" and "Good job, Jeremy" (shown below).     DeviantArt user MegaSweet[1] posted the original pony shrug image on /co/ December 12, 2010, which was just days before he uploaded it to his DeviantArt account.[7] It was a simple outline drawing of Pinkie Pie titled "lol idunno." As the title suggests, the image is often used as a substitute for I dunno LOL.     The phrase was first used in a scene from the 1997 film Titanic[1] starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. After seeing nude drawings Jack Dawson (DiCaprio) had done, Rose (Winslet) tells him, "Jack, I want you to draw me like one of your French girls" (shown below).[2] The earliest known use of the quote for comedic effect can be traced to an entry in a Moviefone[3] caption contest for the superhero film Iron Man in 2008, which paired the phrase with a photo of Tony Stark (played by Robert Downey Jr.) showing off an arc reactor mounted in his chest to Obadiah Stane (played by Jeff Bridges; shown below). The first image macro instance featuring the phrase was a LOLcat image posted to I Can Haz Cheezburger[4] on May 4th, 2008.  In 1996, a comic book based on the video game Doom titled Knee Deep in the Dead[5] was released by Id Software as a gift for attendees at a gaming convention (shown below). The Doom comic was drawn by Tom Grindberg, an artist who has worked for both Marvel and DC Comics as well as 2000AD, and written by Steve Behling and Michael Stewart. In the comic, the protagonist DoomGuy is introduced under the effects of a berserk powerup, granting him invincibility and super strength to destroy enemies with his bare hands. When discovering a cyber demon, DoomGuy announces he will "rip and tear" its "huge guts" before the effects of the powerup wear off (shown below). Though the phrase "How About No?" has been used since as early as 1987[4], it did not gain wider popularity until 1999, when it was used in Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.[5] In an exchange between Dr. Evil (played by Mike Myers) and his son, Scott (played by Seth Green) after Scott suggests that his father use his time machine to kill Powers when he does not anticipate it (shown below, left). Dr. Evil uses the phrase again in the 2002 film, Austin Powers in Goldmember[6] after the agent known as Goldmember (also played by Mike Myers) asks Dr. Evil if he could paint Powers' genitals gold after he captures him (shown below, right).  His handle name "Ribbon-chan" comes from a little hamster girl with the same name from a Japanese Manga/Anime series Hamtaro.[1] Like her trademark phrase, he always posted comments with "-Dechuwa" (でちゅわ) suffix, spoke like a little girl, and had never shown his personal info as well as other Japanese internet users. However, he managed to upload his self‐portrait and posted it to 2channel when he was emboldened by alcohol in a day in 2006,. By this picture, Ribbon-chan was discovered that he was a middle-aged guy with too unfashionable and cornball look. One of the first references to the wooden spoon prank can be found in a scene from the 2001 Christian comedy romance film Extreme Days, in which one of the main characters is tricked into playing the game at a diner. Several years later, it quickly began to spread on YouTube[1] following the release of a New Zealand energy drink commercial in in March 2007.              The Japanese-singing version of Dschinghis Khan was included as a bonus track in the Japanese version of The Leningrad Cowboys's 5th studio album "Mongolian Barbeque" released in 1997 (shown below, left).[3] Meanwhile, the trigger of this fad was an hand-drawn animated video posted to NND on October 3rd, 2008 (shown below, right)[4], which was created by a user Voltaren Suppo (ボルタレンサポ). The character parforming the "drunk dance" along with the song in this video is Suika Ibuki, a "Hard Drinker" character from Touhou Project series. Via: MAXILYRICS[5]  The phrase "I can count to potato" was first used in the 2005 comedy film The Ringer in which con man Steve Barker (played by Johnny Knoxville) pretends to be mentally disabled in order to compete in the Special Olympics. The phrase can be heard at 1:14 in the following clip where Barker rehearses his performance in the mirror: A "count to potato" t-shirt was submitted to CafePress[8] on January 10th, 2006. The earliest known image macro featuring a photo of reality television star Heidi Montag was posted on the celebrity meme blog ROFL Razzi[1] on November 8th, 2008.    Not much is known about this Image macro, as it only first appeared 05/30/11 13:29 on /a/. Seemingly it represents a workforce that requires new people, but the new people 'character archetypes' conflict with with either their looks or something else…      On May 25th, 2011 YouTuber "pekaga" uploaded a video titled "ΑΓΑΝΑΚΤΙΣΜΕΝΟΙ ΠΟΛΙΤΕΣ ΜΑΡΚΟΣ", "Citizens angered Markos" in English, featuring an old man from the city of Rethymnon, Crete that interrupted an interview discussing the Greek uprisings of late May and early June of 2011. English Translation:    On February 22nd, 2007, YouTube launched the AudioSwap[11] service, which allows video uploaders to replace copyrighted music with licensed tracks.[9] In September of 2008, the Korean-based web music service Musicshake partnered with YouTube as a song provider for Audioswap.[10] The music project 009 Sound System was created by American musician Alexander Perls, who released the first tracks on the compilation album Track One Recordings Vol. 1[8] on November 18th of that year. Several 009 Sound System songs were included in the Musicshake library and many YouTubers began selecting the tracks in Audioswap, presumably influenced by its placement at the top of the alphabetical list.       The first instance of the catchphrase being used in an image macro is supposedly from December 10th, 2006, uploaded on Flickr.[1] It used a picture of Annoyed Picard from Star Trek, making an exaggerated hand gesture, seeming to point out to something that he doesn't approve of. This specific hand gesture became one of the defining elements of "WTF is This Shit" image macros, although it isn't always present. "WTF is This Shit" can also be considered as a more hostile variant of "What is This I don't Even".     Commando was directed by Mark L. Lester and distributed by 20th Century Fox in 1985. It became popular amongst B-movie fans due to its poor acting and cheesy one liners.[1] In Japan, the most popular Japanese dubbed version was translated by Katsushige Hirata and was broadcast on television in 1989.  The single topic blog "Sarah Jessica Parker Looks Like A Horse" was created on April 14th, 2008, one month prior to the May 30th release of the Sex and the City movie.[1] The blog consists of photos of Parker directly next to photos of horses. Wilber, who created the site, claims that he was inspired by a clip from the movie Ed Wood, featuring Sarah Jessica Parker.[2] "Do I really have the face of a horse?"   The Picard video, featuring a song by artist DarkMateria, was uploaded to YouTube on September 6th, 2006. It has received over 1.4 million views as of May 2011. The "Fap Guy" face originated from a "Now Kiss" rage comic titled "Principal Creepy" (shown below, left), which was submitted by FunnyJunk user KingGawjuss on February 16th, 2010. Its humorous association with masturbation jokes is believed to have begun on May 31st, when FunnyJunk[18] user TehEman submitted a comic titled “Fap Fap Fap Fap Guy!” (shown below, right).   The original image spawned from /a/ as a deliberate attempt to troll people who have a waifu. In it, A picture of General Veers [1] is captioned with the phrase "She is a cartoon, not your waifu"  The phrase "haters to the left" was first spoken by Kenneth in an episode of the television show 30 Rock titled "The Source Awards", which originally aired on March 1st, 2007.  The anime adaptation of the manga Nichijou was produced by animation studio Kyoto Animation and first premiered in Japan on April 3rd, 2011. The show's opening theme song was written and performed by composer Kenichi Maeyamada, better by his stage name Hyadain. He got this opportunity through the popularity of his many works (such as Western Show) on Niconico, and this song was his debut single under a major record label as Hyadain. The official music video for this song was uploaded to his YouTube (shown below, left) and Niconico account, and the opening credits of the anime has been shared many times on YouTube and Niconico (shown below, right).       The phrase “I don’t want to live on this planet anymore” comes from an episode of Futurama titled “A Clockwork Origin” that aired on Comedy Central on August 12th, 2010. In the episode, which parodies the well-known debate of creation vs. evolution, Professor Farnsworth can be heard uttering the phrase when he is told that his discovery of the “Homo Farnsworth” actually disproves evolution.[1] On March 12th, 2011, a rage comic was submitted to the f7u12 subreddit with the Professor Farnsworth image in the final frame. The post received over 214 up votes prior to being archived. In spring of 2011, Christian evangelist Harold Camping declared May 21st, 2011 as The Rapture, the day when those who follow the Christian faith will be taken to live eternally in a place called “heaven”, leaving the rest of the non-believers behind. As the date approached, it became a popular discussion topic online and spawned image macros and rapture-related hashtags on Twitter. On May 19th, 2011, the Tumblr blog "FuckYeahDementia"[1] posted an example image of "rapture bombing" with instructions indicating that clothes should be left out in public to make it appear as if the person wearing them had vanished.  The phenomenon started to gain momentum across the country in March 2011, when the pro-rugby player David "Wolfman" Williams planked (shown below) after a try during the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles vs Newcastle Knights game held on March 27th, 2011. The term "planking" was reportedly coined in 2008 by Paul Carran, a New Zealander living in Sydney, Australia. Born in Dunedin, Carran started planking after hearing about a similar game friends were playing in UK in 2008.[1][2]  According to Pixiv Encyclopedia[1] and several wiki pages/blog posts,[2][3] Moetron was first created on img, one of the /b/-like boards in the Japanese anonymous imageboard community Futaba Channel (2chan), in late 2009 or early 2010. She was made for Konashine (こな死ね), a well known troll who had been vandalizing Lucky Star threads in the board and sent "Die! Konata…Die!" to every single post with Konata Izumi's pictures. Circa 2009, to poke fun at him, img users started creating a vast amount of mashups of Konata and other characters to test how much "Konata essence" was needed to stimulate his emotion. This mashup series is called "konachan", "konachan!" or "konachang!" (purposely written in alphabet) and some of illustrations in the series are archived on Pixiv by the creators.[4] This series continued even after the troll was gone, and eventually a "moeblob"[5] of Konata and several other characters, using a template image of Konata (shown below, left), came to be known as one established character: KimeKona (shown below, right). The name is an abbreviation for Kimee Konata (きめぇこなた, lit. "Creepy Konata") or Kimera Konata (キメラこなた, lit. "Chimera Konata"). Also, this series of expolitables of that Konata template image is called KonaCora (こなコラ, lit. "Konata Collage") in img as well as Pixiv.[6] The template of Konata had already become a popular exploitable on 4chan's boards outside of Moetron for various other characters. However, KimeKona was first posted on 4chan's /a/ board on May 7th 2010, where she was swiftly dubbed as "Moetron" by the board's users.        The first image macro using the phrase was a PTSD Clarinet Boy derivative which read, "They told me I could be anything I wanted, so I became a God." The source image came from the single topic blog Awkward Family Photos in July of 2009. The oldest record of the phrase "so I became a god" can be found in the Book of Isaiah, quoting Classical writer Horace's commentary on man-made idols: Even heathen writers long ago laughed at this folly, that men ventured to form gods according to their own fancy out of corruptible matter which they formerly despised. Hence came that jest of Horace, " Once I was a trunk of a fig-tree, a useless piece of wood, when a carpenter, uncertain whether to make a bench or a Priajus, preferred that I should be a god ; and so I became a god. (Isaiah 44:1-28)    On October 18th, 2010, Asahi Food & Health Care started a TV commercial for Ippon Manzoku Bar[2]. Tsuyoshi Kusanagi, a member of the popular Japanese idol group SMAP, was casted as its protagonist for the first TV ads for this cereal bar. It's plot was very simple : In a office, Kusanagi, who wanted to eat Ippon Manzoku Bar as soon as the clock strikes 5 P.M., came to eat it and dance for the joy for it with co-workers' song and handclap. In that news release[2], this commercial's director said that Kusanagi winged his dancing completely, and the studio was full of laughter. The Tumblr site "Where's Randy Savage?"[9] was created by Michael Frankito[1] on December 24th, 2010. Since its launch, the blog has published over 203 original and user-submitted images featuring Randy Savage.  The character was designed and uploaded March 2006 by DeviantART user tiggerfactory[1], whose real name is Elisa Kwon[2], a Korean illustrator from Sao Paulo, Brazil. As of May 2011, the only Pyong-related artwork that still remains on her user profile is "Dress Pyong Game"[3], a flash animation game based on her red fox character. Artistic photographs with profound quotes have been circulating online prior to emergence of this series, most notably through online art communities and blog platforms like LiveJournal[1] and DeviantArt[2]. Making custom postcard images made a leap in 2010 with the advent of filter-equipped camera apps like Instagram and Hipstamatic, providing easy ways to take pictures and upload them via photo-sharing websites like Tumblr and Flickr. By December 2010, both apps reached the one million users mark and thousands of sentimentalist, ambient postcard images continued to emerge on Tumblr. Self-uploaded vanity shots of emo, hardcore and hipster youths have been a staple subject of internet humor since the late 2000s, further boosted by the launch of Tumblr blog "Look At This Fucking Hipster" and Demotivational Posters. The style of using red text as the buzzkill or "Hipster Edits" can be attributed to a series of images posted by Tumblr blog tumblr4men[3] as early as on August 23rd, 2010.  The original image was posted in the single topic blog Awkward Family Photos[1] on July 17th, 2009. Titled "A Beautiful Mind," the caption asked readers to think about what was going on in the young boy's head. By December 2009, the image was picked up by the image macro creating site Meme Generator, where it initially was called "Veteran PTSD Clarinet Boy," adopting the voice of Vietnam war veterans remembering the past. However, it is unclear what the first instance of this was. "Fight Against an Armed Boss" was written by a Japanese video game composer Yoko Shimomura[2] (shown below, left). Meanwhile, the oldest MAD video was uploaded to the Japanese video sharing service Nico Nico Douga (NND) on October 27th, 2007.[3] This video was also a derivative of Futae no Kiwami. But, the first "Dangerous series" video was introduced as part of the IKZO phenomenon on April 26th, 2008, and was titled "Dangerous IKZO"[4] (shown below, right). On April 22nd 2011, S.T.Corporation started new CM series for Shoushu-Riki. While several versions were made, the most frequently commercial featured a foreigner singing on a street corner with no explanation. The strange combination of the boy's song with the vista in the background were confusing to viewers. It was apparent that this was a commercial movie for Shoshu-Riki until he sang its trade name at the end. Moreover, the direct trade name written in Kanji characters is not considered sophisticated by Japanese sensibilities, and the video was considered to be a joke by many.       No Homo was popularized in the early 1990s among youths in East Harlem[1], most notably rapper Cam'ron who later incorporated the phrase into his album lyrics in 2006. In the following years, hip hop artists like Lil Wayne and Jay-Z appropriated the phrase for their own lyrics as a way to excuse any reference that could be potentially misinterpreted[6], as well as other straight men who want to make a clear distinction that they do not take part in a secret gay lifestyle.[4][7]  The scene originates from the Ed, Edd n Eddy episode "A Town Called Ed", which originally aired on April 20, 2007.[1] In the episode, various children from the cul-de-sac head over to Kevin's house for a monster truck rally TV marathon viewing party. Eddy, angry that they are more interested in the marathon than the story of his significance to the town of Peach Creek, decides to get their attention by messing with Kevin's TV signal, causing the TV to cut to static. Kevin tries to fix this by repeatedly banging on the side of TV; the signal then returns, but Ed, Edd and Eddy appear on the screen. Sarah then shouts: "I hate public access!"  Niko Bellic, the protagonist for the popular video game Grand Theft Auto 4, is given various forms of transportation options which the player may choose. One of these is the taxi cab, which is actually a very good alternative to driving yourself when Niko is drunk. Incidentally, while intoxicated Niko will call down a cab with the shouted phrase "yellow car!" This humorous line was picked up by the Gmodder community and many videos including Niko and yellow cars as the central theme were made. The still shot of Giorgio A. Tsoukalos originated from the History Channel series Ancient Aliens[1], a documentary series that explores the possibility that aliens may have visited in the past. The program is directed and produced by Giorgio A. Tsoukalos and first aired on April 20th, 2010.   The "Cupcakes" fanfiction is thought to have first appeared on 4chan's imageboard /co/ sometime in January 2011, though the date of original post remains unknown. A canonical reference to the Episode 12 in the fan-fiction suggests that the earliest possible date of post is January 7th, 2011. On the Equestria Daily version, the authorship has been attributed to "Sergeant Sprinkles". The earliest archived instance of My Little Pony fan-fiction is "Junior Speedsters Forever"[2] posted via Equestria Daily on January 24th, 2011. The World's Most Interesting Cat first began to appear on Blogs such as Tumblr, Icanhascheezbuger[1], MemeBase[2], as well as being added to Meme Generators such as quickmeme.com[3] and Troll.Me[4] This meme is also being spread by Reddit[5].       The original image used in the series comes from a portrait photograph of the best-selling romance novel writer Carly Phillips (shown far left), although it remains unclear why or how the author became associated with the joke. The earliest instance of the image macro (shown far right) can be traced back to May 5th, 2011, posted on Quickmeme and Reddit.[1]      The original comic was published on June 8th, 2008 on page 120 of Kate Beaton's webcomic Hark! A Vagrant, titled "Ooh Mister Darcy".[1] The original comic was a comedic strip about Pride and Prejudice and its famous romantic interest, Mister Darcy, parodying the novels vast amount of fan-fiction.    El Hadji Diouf is a Senegalese football player currently playing for Scottish Premier League club Glasgow Rangers. He is best known for his ability to handle a versatile range of positions. He has also brought a large amount of media attention to himself for a series of controversial incidents and remarks, such as numerous offenses of spitting at spectators, cursing at the referee during a match and most recently announcing his support for the Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. During his debut match for the Rangers against Hearts FC on February 2nd, 2011, Diouf was tackled by Hearts' midfielder Ian Black, resulting in an injury for the Senegalese footballer[1]:    Matryoshka was originally written and composed by Vocaloid producer Hachi[1] (ハチ), and was uploaded to Nico Nico Douga[5] on August 19, 2010, along with a reprint to Youtube (shown below) on the same day. The song featured a duet of the Vocaloid characters Hatsune Miku and Gumi while being set to an Alternative Rock sound. The name of the song refers to the Matryoshka[6] (Russian: матрёшка), which is a wooden nesting doll-set originating from Russia. One of the most notable and talked-about aspects of the song are the lyrics, as they appear to be nonsensical. Much debate and many interpretations about their true meaning has been brought up since its release. According to a Vocaloid wikia[2] page for the song, many believe that the lyrics could portray hidden sadden or insanity, while other say it's about the stress of Gumi and Miku put on by their creators. There is also belief that the song has no true meaning, and that it is meant to be open for interpretations.   Yam Ah Mee is the Returning Officer (RO) for Singapore's 2011 election and the chief executive director of People's Association, a statutory board leading efforts to promote racial harmony and social cohesion in Singapore. Mr Yam Ah Mee had served in the Republic of Singapore Air Force and held a rank of Brigadier General On May 8th, 2011, Mr. Yam appeared before the Singaporean press corp to announce the electorate winners. While it was a critical moment in the nation's closely contested race, many viewers at home became fixated with Mr.Yam's monotonous speech and indifferent expression, particularly on a legal clause that was repeated over 26 times: Some of the other memorable lines from his speech included mispronunciations of Workers' Party candidate "Sylvia Lim" into "Silver Lim" and Minister of Education Masagos Zulkifli into "Masagos Chukifree." Even the Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong name wasn't spared, which Mr. Yam pronounced as "Lee Hsien Loon." Since 2005WTTC, which was held in Shanghai, CCTV made songs for every year’s WTTC in order to bolster the morale of the Chinese representatives. All the songs make for the WTTC are called “Ping Ping Pong Pong, Unparalleled In The World” with a season number behind it, counted from 2005. For 2011WTTC, CCTV also made a song for it, called “Ping Ping Pong Pong, Unparalleled In The World” the 7th season. On May 1 2011, the song was debuted on CCTV-5 (Sports)’s Sports News.    The catchphrase comes from the film Tropic Thunder, starring Ben Stiller, Robert Downey, Jr.. and Jack Black and premiered on August 13th, 2008, revolving around a group of actors who are making a Vietnam War movie. One scene features the character Kirk Lazarus (played Robert Downey Jr) giving Chuck Speedman (played by Ben Stiller) advice and criticism on one of his films, "Simple Jack." In the scene, he talks about how Chuck's acting method for his mentally handicapped character, the titular Simple Jack went "full retard", thereby exhibiting overtly realistic depictions of people with disabilities that audiences find offensive. Kirk uses examples of other famous films and actors who played similar characters.  On April 25th, 2011, Redditor GrandadsLadyFriend posted a thread titled "Introducing Harmless Scout Leader" with a link to the image above.[1] He created a Quickmeme page the following day.[2] The picture originated from a January 2011 Roanoke Times article congratulating volunteer leadership among Scoutmasters and other volunteers in addition to welcoming newly inducted Eagle Scouts in the Blue Ridge Mountains Council of Virginia.[8] On February 3rd, 2011, YouTubers[1] Yogscast Simon and Lewis posted a video titled, "Minecraft – 'Shadow of Israphel' Part 8: Diggy Diggy Hole," the eighth part of their Minecraft Let's Play series. At around 10 minutes in, Lewis asks Simon to sing a song about being a dwarf digging a hole. At timestamp 10:07 in the video, Simon sings the song in a "dwarvish accent" (shown below). The video gained over 4 million views in 10 years. The use of the word "fucks" as a plural noun was first documented in an Urban Dictionary entry for "Give No Fucks" submitted on September 15th, 2009: It was also popularized through another closely related catchphrase "Not a Single Fuck Was Given That Day" which emerged as early as in 2009 and spread across Tumblr throughout 2010. The image of the original instance stems from the 1965 musical film The Sound of Music and features the character Maria spinning around merrily in a field of flowers. The earliest known upload of this image took place in November 2010 on the internet humor site The Chive[1] and an animated GIF version of the same image was posted via FunnyJunk on January 16th, 2011.[2] The title of the meme, X de Gozaimasu, is bascailly japanese for I am X, a reference to the anime from which the music was taken, Sazae-San, in which the lead character, Sazae Fuguta, would start each episode by saying "Sazae de Gozaimasu", a reference which would be instantly recognisable to nearly anyone in Japan. On August 17th 2008, a Nico Nico Douge user uploaded a video "Konata de Gozaimasu"[2] of the character Konata from the anime Lucky Star dancing to the song, along with samples of her voice set to the music, in much the same way as the Paffendorf Dance , which was also based around clips of Lucky Star. All other videos use this as the template for the characters movements. A 4chan archive thread[1] containing various drinking cards dates back to January 2nd, 2010, and a second archived thread[2] dates back to March 23rd, 2010. A zip file containing a large collection of the cards can be found at lolcathost.org.[3] Some of the older card templates were based off the popular Yu-Gi-Oh trading card game[4]. The image and phrase began to gain popularity starting around March of 2010; however, examples of the phrase "and not a single fuck was given that day" appear online as early as 2009. Usage of this phrase and image macros has been steadily growing on 4chan since March 2010, and has become a popular macro on Reddit. "Not a Single Fuck Was Given That Day" also has a Facebook group with over 4000 members. On February 6th, 2011, Super Bowl XLV took place at the Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas.[1] When Christina Aguilera appeared on stage to sing the national anthem "The Star-Spangled Banner," she sang the slightly altered lyrics "what so proudly we watched at the twilight's last reaming" instead of "O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming." Shortly afterwards, Aguilera herself admitted the mistake[3]. On February 22nd, 2011 Redditor maip23[12] suggested an idea for a new advice animal character called "Wrong Lyrics Christina," encouraging other Redditors to create an image macro series based on a photograph of Christina Aguilera and verbatim texts of frequently misheard lyrics.   The phrase was coined by fans of the franchise who were disappointed with Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, released on May 22nd, 2008, particularly about a highly unrealistic scene wherein Jones (played by Harrison Ford) escapes a nuclear explosion unharmed by hiding inside a refrigerator. According to Newsweek, the phrase was first used on the IMDB message board for Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull on May 24th, two days after the film's release. An episode of The Simpsons aired on February 9th, 1997 titled "The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show", that features a dog character voiced by Homer that says a very similar line. Homer learns that Poochie will be killed off and is resolved to keep Poochie alive. At his next recording session, rather than reading from the script, he implores the audience, through lines he himself wrote, to give Poochie a fair chance. The writing team is impressed with Homer's statement, and he is led to believe that the comments will be in the next cartoon. Instead, Meyers dubs the correct line--"I have to go now. My planet needs me."--into the dialogue, and the animation cel containing Poochie is yanked out of view. A statement attesting to the dog's demise (he died on the way back to his home planet) is hurriedly edited into the cartoon; the in-studio audience cheers wildly as Krusty promises that Poochie is gone for good. Homer feels betrayed but, after realizing he never got paid for his efforts, chalks things up to the nature of show business.[1] This scene is listed as part of the "but now I must go" trope listed on TV Tropes. An easy way to add anywhere from a twinge of sentimentality to a whole extra Tear Jerker scene to the end of your movie: after helping out and saving the day, The Drifter character must leave forever.[2] The original photo of the six-year-old child was posted to Reddit by his father, user "superluminal", on May 3rd, 2011. The thread was titled "My son turns 6 on Thursday. I told him to smile nicely for his Kindergarten picture. This is what we got. (pic)".[1] The names "Cheesy Pick-Up Line Kid" and "Suave six year old" have been coined by redditors "billyfazz" and "Perturbed_Spartan" respectively, in the comment thread of the original photo: Bakemonogatari was produced by animation studio SHAFT and first aired in Japan from July 3, 2009 to September 25, 2009, where the series centers around the protagonist Koyomi Araragi, who deals with deities and spirits that reflect people's inner problems. "Renai Circulation" was composed by Satoru Kosaki and sung by Japanese voice actress Kana Hanazawa[1], and was used as the theme song for the "Nadeko Snake" arc, where Koyomi Araragi tries to help Nadeko Sengoku get rid of a curse that will eventually kill her without treatment.  In December 2010, Ming General Japanese Sushi Restaurant introduced a buffet-style value meal, which costs each customer HKD $43.90 for an unlimited quantity of sushi. Upon its introduction, some Hong Kong netizens who tried the sushi began posting poor customer reviews about the food quality, describing the meal as “The worst tasted sushi in Hong Kong.” Meanwhile, others rebutted with tongue-in-cheek reviews praising the economic value of Ming General sushi meal. The earliest known customer review of General Ming restaurant can be found on Get JetSo[1], a discount coupon website.  The Next Level is a meme that originated on Georgia Tech campus in May 2011. During Spring 2011 at Georgia Tech, cameras went to different classrooms to record footage for a promotional video for the Computational Media (CM) major. On April 27th, 2011, the final cut was posted to YouTube. On the evening of May 3rd at 4am, students writing reflection papers for the Computational Media degree viewed this video. The emphatic reply of one student to "take it to the next level" stood out from the rest. After an all-nighter, the primary image of the meme was created the next afternoon at 1:15pm and was posted to Meme Generator. The link quickly spread among CM students, eager to blow off steam at the end of the semester.     Currently, the origin is thought to be Canv.as, but the definitive and specific origin of this meme is being researched. The image was taken from the Season 1, Episode 4 titled "Applebuck Season" that aired on November 5th, 2010.[1] It features the character Rainbow Dash making an excited facial expression while proclaiming eagerness to train with Applejack, and can be seen in the video below: The earliest known use of the phrase online was by Urban Dictionary user AgentSythe for "Anne Frank" on April 23rd, 2007, in which she is described as "Hide and seek champion 1941-1944."[1] On April 8th, 2008, eBaum's World user PeachyKeen uploaded a demotivational poster of Anne Frank with the text "Hide and Seek World Champion 1942-1944" (shown below).[2]  The official White House photo of President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and members of the National Security Council huddled in the Situation Room was taken by Pete Souza on May 1st, 2011. It is believed that the photograph was taken while the group was receiving updates on the mission that would ultimately kill bin Laden.[8] The image was uploaded to the White House's official Flickr[1] on May 2nd, the day after the announcement of bin Laden's death, with a disclaimer stating that: "The Photograph may not be manipulated in any way and may not be used in commercial or political materials, advertisements, emails, products, promotions that in any way suggests approval or endorsement of the President, the First Family, or the White House." One of the earliest photoshopped versions of the image was a facebomb, posted to Reddit[19] on May 2nd, receiving 1,820 upvotes and 1,299 downvotes. The song "Jesus Take the Wheel" by Carrie Underwood was released on October 3rd, 2005, which tells the story of a mother who hits a patch of black ice why driving on Christmas Eve and cries out for Jesus as her car spins out of control. After the automobile safely stops on the side of the road, the woman decides to let "Jesus take the wheel" of her life.[1]     The Christian rap group DC Talk released it's second album in 1990 titled "Nu Thang", which contained the a track by the same name. The cover starring the child was uploaded to YouTube on April 26th 2011.     It is suspected that it originated on 4chan, but there are no archived threads to confirm this. The earliest verified mention comes from the Foul Bachelorette Frog Facebook page in March of 2010.[1] The advice animal drawing was inspired by a photo from the website myfacewhen.com.[1] The picture has been used as a reaction face on the Wiremod[2] forums as far back as December 2nd, 2010. The earliest known instance of the Ash Pedreiro ("brick layer" in Portuguese) advice animal was posted on the Portuguese website Cao Ninja on February 2nd, 2011. According to Desciclopedia[3], "pedreiro" is a slang term used to label Brazilian construction workers who say cheesy pick-up lines to women who walk past work sites, similar to the American "construction catcall" trope.[13] The face originally appeared in a comic titled Nobody is Right[3] that was shared on deviantArt on September 16th, 2008 by the user 3-Angled-Blue. At the royal wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton on April 29th, 2011, Princess Beatrice attended the event wearing a strange intricate bow-like chapeau. The hat was created by Irish designer Philip Treacy[1], who also made 35 other hats worn at the same event. Immediately after the wedding on April 29th, the viral content site BuzzFeed[2] posted several pictures of Beatrice at the wedding. On February 18th, 2011, YouTuber Raikujo uploaded a Garry's Mod animation titled "The Vicious Cycle of 2fort," featuring a frantic Team Fortress 2 battle on the "2fort" map with the song "Bãtutã Din Moldova" playing in the background (shown below). Within four years, the video gained over 2.6 million views and 9,500 comments.  On April 3, 2011, a link to a game titled "Luna Game" was posted to Equestria Daily[1], a My Little Pony blog. The link provided a download to an executable file[5] that had to be run off the user's hard drive in order to play (unlike embedded flash games that could be played in a browser window) as explained in the follow-up blog post[2].             Rule 63 was first introduced as part of the expanded edition of Anonymous' Rules of the Internet, most likely published in the summer of 2007, based on Google Insights. The Urban Dictionary[1] entry for "Rule 63" was first submitted by user InternetHateMachine on August 8th, 2007. The original photo of the frog, filename frog-freckles-sore-throat-worst-home-remedies.jpg, first appeared in a post on the now defunct site remedicated.com titled "10 Bizarre and Ineffective Home Treatments" published sometime in June of 2008.  The idea of making a set of rules, similar to Netiquette[5] for 4chan users, was initially talked about on Anonymous-related IRC channels before an entry was submitted to Encyclopedia Dramatica sometime in late 2006 and archived[6] on January 10th, 2007. The entry was highly debated on its discussion page[7] as well as the site’s forums. At the time of the archival, there were 18 rules in the entry, despite it mentioning that 48 existed. One of the earliest online references to a menacing "soon" appears in the webcomic The Parking Lot Is Full[21] in an installment posted on March 27th, 2001. The comic, captioned, "Quiet Ambition," features Jesus behind God's shoulder thinking, "Soon."       The phrase originates from an episode of the online cooking show EpicMealTime entitled 'Breakfast of Booze', which was uploaded to Youtube on November 30, 2010. The original line is "Next level breakfast maneuver", and occurs at 1:27 in the video. Next level breakfast maneuver was spoken by Harley Morenstein, host and creator of Epicmealtime. Almost immediately after the video was uploaded, the comments were filled with people quoting or paraphrasing the line. The line stood out because of its out-of-place nature, as the simple task of egg-washing breakfast was being described with verbose language.     The phrase was first introduced through the TV sitcom series Community in Season 1, Episode 15 titled "Romantic Expressionism" which aired on February 4th, 2010. In the episode, one of the main characters Troy Barnes (played by actor Donald Glover) utters the line "I have the weirdest boner" after his friend Jeff whispers something into his ear. The clip of the scene from the episode was uploaded a month later by YouTuber bmw182[1] on March 3rd, 2010 and has since gained more than 260,000 views as of September 2012. Meanwhile, personal anecdotes about ill-timed or inappropriate erections have been shared via online communities like Reddit and 4chan prior to the airing of the episode.  This exploitable series comes from a stillshot of Fluttershy taken from Episode 22 of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic – "A Bird in the Hoof". In this episode, one of the main characters, Fluttershy, attempts to care for Princess Celestia's sick bird. However, the bird is actually a phoenix at the end of its life cycle, which Fluttershy is not aware of. At one point, the phoenix finally bursts into flame and turns to a pile of ash, leading Fluttershy to believe she has killed the bird. The original image from the episode:  In 1989 Nintendo and Mattel released the Power Glove, a hand worn glove controller that was in some ways a precursor to the modern day Wii-mote, reacting to movement of the hand and fingers to control the onscreen action. Despite the amount of time put into the production of the controller and the demonstration of it in the movie, the controller was infamous for it's imprecise and difficult to use controls, and with only two games specifically released for use with it, it grossed sales of around $88 million and was both a critical and commercial failure. 1989 also saw the release of the movie The Wizard. Essentially a feature-length advertisement for Nintendo products, the movie starred Luke Edwards as an apparently autistic boy obsessed with going to California so he can put a memorial to his dead sister inside a tourist attraction there. On the way, his brother Fred Savage discovers he is a genius at playing video games, and enters him in a competition. Also on the way, they encounter Justin, and the aforementioned scene takes place. A related meme is the phrase "Everything else is child's play", in reference to the poster advertising it. The pure melodramatic 80's/early 90's cheese of it has gave it a similarly popular place in the pop-cultural history.  The original phrase referenced online comes from a page in an incestuous Simpsons comic from the website Drawn-sex, which has since been taken down (shown below). After the comic was posted onto /co/, the phrase became a hit and spread to several other boards on 4chan. It is occasionally used in /a/ as well, mainly to suggest that it's the reason for the lack of Western animation pornography. The earliest archived mention of the phrase is from the haiku's thread on the /b/[1] board on December 15th, 2006. This was most certainly not the catchphrase's first appearance, though the first is unknown (shown below).        The phrase came from a Something Awful[2] thread titled "You can't fight the man, but I'll damn well try!" posted by user Jer on December 8th, 2004. The thread described how Jer had attempted to fight against a parking ticket using various drawings and diagrams: One of the pages featured a cropped photo of Happy Cat along with the phrase "oh god how did this get in here I am not good with computers": The first Nyanyanyanyanyanyanya! video [2] was originally produced by the Japanese musician daniwellP and uploaded via Nico Nico Douga on July 25th, 2010. Although it may sound like Miku isn't singing, but she is actually singing "nya- nya-" from the beginning to the end, according to the site's encyclopedic entry.[3] As of April 2011, this video has more than 800,000 views on the Japanese video-sharing hubsite. The word "Nya" is a Japanese informal word denoting the cry of a cat, like "Meow" in English, with a specific connotation of "cuteness". It is very popular amongst NND users. It is also the name of Nico Nico Douga power user "Nya", who pioneered the genre of 3D-model based MikuMikuDance (MMD) videos in November 2007. It also refers to the filename extensions for NND's Live Effect animation files (.nya). It is belived to have come from Reddit. The original (mabye) its not okayu comic. Between December 29th, 2010 and January 14th, 2011, Kobe Shimbun posted a job-placement ad of part-time news reporters/web editors for covering otaku media on the web site[4], which was conducted as a part of emergency job creation plans by the prefectural government. In this quite earnest ad, it gave one unique question about a blue-eyed and blue-haired girl wearing a blue sailor-suit: "Give 3 reasons why this character on the right figure is not so cute (lacking in moe)." The question continues "If you could answer this question easily, you have a chance to bring out knowledge and experience of your hobbies in Kobe Shimbun." Puella Magi Madoka Magica is a sci-fi fantasy anime series produced by Shaft, a well-known animation company behind the wildly popular, albeit controversial, series Bakemonogatari. The first ten episodes aired in Japan between January 6th, 2011 and March 10th, 2011, with the last two episodes getting delayed until April 21st, 2011, following the national earthquake disaster in March. Initially, the official trailers and opening sequence set up the show as a typical "magical girl" anime featuring Kyubey as just another adorable magical companion, in similiar vein to Kero from Card Captor Sakura. Throughout the series, Kyubey tries to recruit the protagonist Madoka and her friend Sayaka as magical witch fighters by offering to grant one wish in exchange for entering a contract with him. From very early on, fans began speculating that Kyubey had ulterior motives and might very well be evil.[3] Kyubey makes his appearance in the first episode of Puella Magi Madoka Magica. During a post apocalyptic dream sequence, where he tries to convince Madoka that if she made a contract with him and became a magical girl, she could reverse the destruction caused by the giant monster demolishing the city. Madoka meets Kyubey later on in the episode when she rescues him from the mysterious transfer student, Homura. In the Saiyan saga of the classic anime series Dragonball Z[7], the villain character Nappa makes use of an alien species called "Saibamen" to attack the main characters, including Yamcha. After one of the Saibamen attacks Yamcha using a self-destruction technqiue called the "Saibamen Bomb" which ends up killing both of them, Yamcha's corpse is left lying in the familiar pose. Yamcha's death pose and the tag "ヤムチャしやがって…" ("you were Yamcha") first emerged in early 2009 as a derivative of the colloquial expression "無茶しやがって…" ("you were reckless") which has been used on Nico Nico Douga[1] when referring to someone who's made an attempt at something absurd or impossible. Such association of Yamcha and FAIL was established most likely due to the character's feeble strength in comparison to other Saiyan-blooded characters including his friends Goku and his son Gohan. Outside of the Internet, one of the most popular counter-culture instruction manuals was published in 1971 titled The Anarchist Cookbook. It contained graphics and instructions on how to make explosives, telephone phreaking devices, drugs and many other items.[3] Today's life hack threads commonly contain similar information like how to break open combination locks, or hack DOTS road service signs. The earliest known appearance of Happy Cat on the web comes from a Russian cat food company, also called Happy Cat. Although the cat was not the primary mascot for the company, it did appear on the website as early as 2003, as evidenced in an archived Happycat.ru thread.[1] There are conflicting reports on the identity of the cat. Some believe Happy Cat is a British shorthair named Frank who was born in 1994 and died in 2007. However, a blog post from corpuscola[7] says it is named Misha and was born in 2003. According to Encyclopedia Dramatica[2] and Oh Internet[3] articles, the Happy Cat meme began when the image was posted to the Something Awful forums in 2003, by user FancyCat. The YTMND Wiki[4] page on the subject also points to Something Awful as the birthplace of Happy Cat. While there is no record of a user named FancyCat on SomethingAwful, there is a "Fancy Cat"[5] (two words) who has been a registered user since 2002, but their post history is incomplete. One of the earliest verifiable appearances of Happy Cat on Something Awful occurred on May 12th, 2004 in an article entitled The Grocery Gauntlet[6] written by Reid "Frolixo" Paskiewicz.       The first image was posted to Reddit on February 1st, 2011, using a color drawing of a praying mantis. In the comments, Redditor JakeCameraAction[1] suggested using an actual photograph of a praying mantis and provided a template that has been used since. The "praying mantis" analogy to an intimidating girlfriend stems from the common association between female praying mantis and sexual cannibalism, in which a female kills and consumes her male partner before, during, or after mating. According to Cuánto Cabrón's explanation of the meme's origin[1], the stick figure character was created by the now-defunct Tumblr blogger rcdb[2] sometime in 2010. Although the original post has since been removed, it was reuploaded to Cuánto Cabrón[5] on December 13th, 2010. Titled “Algo es algo” ("That’s Something"), the comic depicts a contestant on the game show Pasapalabra[6] ("Spread the Word") named Fernando who learns in the first panel that he has lost his winnings. In the second panel, the announcer is shown saying “But at least you get…,” which is revealed to be a board game version of Pasapalabra in the third panel. The rage character is shown in the final panel to partially convey Fernando’s disappointment with his own loss, but also a sense of optimism in that he at least won some sort of physical prize. As of February 2013, the comic has more than 2,600 upvotes on Cuánto Cabrón.    On April 2st, 2011, the Internet humor website Something Awful posted a Photoshop Friday[1] contest titled "Celebrity Match Game", which featured a photo of Steve Buscemi combined with the pop star Justin Bieber. The earliest known instance featuring the tagline "Lights His Joint / With a Bunsen Burner" was uploaded via Quickmeme[1] and picked up on the same day by Reddit[2] on April 6th, 2011. The biographical information regarding the man remains unknown, though several Reddit users claiming to be former students seem to support the notion that he is in fact a Physics professor. The "bait-and-switch" style of caption has been previously seen through other advice animal series like Successful Black Man and Ordinary Muslim Man that play against widespread ethnic stereotypes. Around January 2004, one person anonymously posted bizarre Shift_JIS art of Doraemon called “tanasinn” on a news board. So with that surrealism the ambiguous art became popular, while the meaning was unknown. These surreal posts generally came to be called like “feeling [the] tanasinn”.  During the morning of April 10, 2011, deadmau5 twitted the following statement: i wonder if theres any documented accident of a guy who got hit by a truck… but a truck that was carrying alot of pillows or soft stuff. Many followers began replying about the irony of such situation. Some started making similar jokes with different objects being carried by the truck. There were so many people twittering with deadmau5 about it that when he put the tag #gettinghitbyatruck it became one of the top trending topics in Twitter in less than an hour, with thousands of tweets using the tag.  The original photograph of the crab comes from the March 2010 issue of Fine Cooking in a recipe article on how to prepare a live soft-shell crab[1]. The blog article was posted on March 1st, 2010. On May 28th, 2010 KelThuzadMadness posted a YouTube video which introduced Christian Brutal Sniper to the Garry's Mod community. The video bared the description, "Why the hell is he christian.", the video has over 350,000 views as of date. The original video is here to watch:  The original footage comes from the HBO comedy-drama series Entourage in Season 6, Episode 3: "One Car, Two Car, Red Car, Blue Car," which originally aired on July 26th, 2009 and featuring cameo appearance by Curtis Jackson, better known by his stage name 50 Cent. In the episode, 50 Cent drives up next to Turtle's (played by Jerry Ferrara) convertible Ferrari at a red light, pokes fun at his car before driving away:    This rage face came from Reddit. On April 13, 2010, Reddit user MysteryStain submitted the rage comic "It's Cereal Time [1]." While noted to be similar to other rage comics, the comic's success came from the face in the second panel. As a result, the milk face started to appear in a few more "motherfucking milk" comics. The panel comes from another exploitable Dolan comic in which Dolan approaches Goofy in a Ferrari. In the original, Dolan asks Goofy "Why do you only have four fingers?" After a beat panel, Goofy asks "Wait a sec are u trying to cheat me again?", referencing the comics' penchant for Dolan to be violent. The "cheat" Goofy refers to is the likelihood that Dolan would remove one of his fingers (shown below). Though the original post is unable to be found, it was uploaded to KnowYourMeme on August 17th, 2010. The original male version of the face was based off a scene where David Silverman of American Atheists makes a perplexed expression during a debate with Bill O'Reilly on Fox News. During the exchange O'Reilly uses the "tide goes in, tide goes out" argument for the existence of God that is also the origin of You Can't Explain That image macros. The face is made at about 2:00 into the clip: Silverman: Tide goes in, tide goes out?” O'Reilly: The water, the tide--it comes in and it goes out. It always goes in, then it goes out. … You can’t explain that. You can’t explain it. On January 18th, 2011, a Reddit thread titled "Do your worst :) (FIXED)" linked to a black and white drawing of the expression that would later be used in rage comics as the "are you serious?" face.[1]  The scene comes from chapter 19 of the manga.[1] It's the first contact of the deuteragonist character L and the villain protagonist Light Yagami (Kira) and the first time that Kira was put into an inferior position. The first Engineering Professor image macro was created on Memegenerator[1] and subsequently posted to Reddit[2] on March 28th, 2011 with the caption "Says class won't involve much math / Entirely math." The original photo appeared alongside a January 2010 profile article[7] about Dr. Richard Gitlin[8] at the University of South Florida, an electrical engineering professor and cofounder of digital subscriber line (DSL) technologies. The series began as a commentary on college-level engineering classes, but it quickly grew to encompass criticisms of professors who are considered to be too rigorous, self-contradictory or technologically incapable, similar to the stereotypes explored through other advice animals like High Expectations Asian Father, Unhelpful High School Teacher and Technologically Impaired Duck.     In 2009, Anthony Clark, creator of "Nedroid Picture Diary"[1] and color artist for "The Adventures of Dr. McNinja"[2], created a short comic series about a cat who liked to party a bit too much.[3] Though it is unclear exactly when or where the commenting fad began, one of the earliest mentions of the phrase appeared in the title of an instructional video about removing a PC’s limitations[1] uploaded to YouTube in April 2008. It is likely that the title was retroactively edited to include the phrase after the fad took off, as a number of tags in the video’s description include popular video game and movie titles released in 2010. The earliest archived instance of the phrase appearing in YouTube comments was posted on a playthrough video[2] depicting a group of World of Warcraft players attempting to defeat the boss Illidan Stormrage.        On March of 2011, the cobra escaped from the Bronx Zoo. Because the snake is highly poisonous, the staff secured and closed off the reptile house in hopes that the snake is still within the enclosure. However, many people seem to embrace the snake's escape. A fake twitter account for the escaped Egyptian cobra was opened in response, and as a result, has eventually gathered more than 200,000 followers on the website. The snake has also gathered attention from various late night talk show hosts including David Letterman and Jon Stewart. The snake's account on the site has made responses based on sightseeing in New York, including visiting the Empire State Building, and has even made a tweet to Charlie Sheen's account. The snake was found Thursday, March 31st, hiding in the reptile house. On April 7, 2011, The Bronx Zoo organized a public poll to name the cobra. Of the 33,000 votes, the results of the poll was to name the cobra Mia. In response, another Twitter account in Mia's name was established, gaining the attention of hundreds of thousands. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMSUvqzPbTY Origin of the Cobra's Name: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-13008307 Twitter Account: http://twitter.com/bronxzooscobra   On April 1st, 2011, Reddit user "Mitsjol" submitted a picture of the Shime coal mine to /r/pics, titled "This would make an awesome anti-zombie fortress."[1] In similar vein to other conceptual jokes like Rocket Propelled Chainsaw and Chinese Gundam, other Reddit users quickly responded with a series of photoshopped images, pointing out structural flaws and sharing their own "anti-zombie" designs, as well as creating replicas of the shaft tower in Minecraft.  Origin: The still shot of George Constanza was taken from the 143rd episode of the American TV sitcom Seinfeld titled “The Abstinence,”[2] which originally aired on November 21st, 1996. While encountering some New York Yankees players at a batting cage, Costanza strikes up a conversation with Bernie Williams and Derek Jeter, who boasts about winning the world series with his team. Constanza responds to Jeter with a smug smile while preparing to swing his bat, coyly replying “Yeah… in six games.” According to Encyclopedia Dramatica[8], the image was first used on 4chan’s /sp/ (sports) board in combination with “>putting ketchup in the fridge,”[9] a greentext phrase used to imply that an activity or choice is abnormal, sometime in early 2011.  To counter international criticism, Bahrain's state-owned television channel BTV aired a documentary (in Arabic) on March 29th, 2011, alleging that a number of policemen had been abducted by pro-democracy protesters and tortured: In one section of the film, an anonymous policeman gives his testimony of how he escaped from his alleged captivity. With a balaclava over his face to hide his identity, he re-enacts his alleged escape. He demonstrates how he climbed out of the room in which he was being held and then claims to have used a plastic hose to descend from the roof of a two-story building: On March 29th, 2011, Charli Dickenson[1], a 22-year-old youth worker from Swansea, United Kingdom tweeted a picture of a residential house in Port Tenant with the following description:        On February 14th, 2011, YouTuber jayrandall22011 uploaded a video of his twin sons titled "Talking Twin Babies." The video featured two toddler boys babbling incoherently at one another in what appeared to be some sort of primitive baby language. The original YouTube upload accumulated over 54 million views within 10 months. "Cirno's Perfect Math Class" was written and arranged by members of IOSYS ARM, Yoshimi Tano, sung by miko, and was featured on the group's album Touhou Anthology of Ice and Snow[1] (東方氷雪歌集, Tōhō Hyōsetsu Kashū), released at the Touhou convention Touhou Kouroumu 4 on November 2nd, 2008. In theme with the album, the song was an arrangement of Cirno's boss theme "Beloved Tomboyish Girl" (おてんば恋娘, Otenba Koimusume), composed by Touhou creator ZUN for her appearance as the second boss in the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil.[2] To promote the album, the song was released online along with a flash-animated music video created by TETLA POT on the album's now-defunct official site on October 25th, 2008.[3] The flash-animation features many references within internet and pop culture in Japan, most notably includes the Colombia Pose and Kira Pose. The video also features many in-jokes known by fans of the Touhou series, which includes the nine-balls (⑨) during the chorus, which is in reference to Cirno's label in the game's layout screen in the Phantasmagoria of Flower View manual, where she is marked "9. Moron". In turn, she is often portrayed by fans as being dim-witted and is associated with the nine-ball, or the number nine, and with the word "baka" (バカ), meaning idiot, moron, or fool in English. On February 8th, 2007, I Can Has Cheezburger posted a picture of a cat with the caption "Make ready my ship general / It is time to show those dogs what we are made of." Later, on March 31st, 2011, a picture of the same cat was posted to Reddit's /pics subreddit titled "This cat looks like Lenin. Your argument is invalid.". Jenna Rose's video for "My Jeans" was first uploaded by YouTuber SRVMOE on October 1st, 2010. Depicting a group of teenage girls going to the mall to look at a pair of jeans and lyrics littered with tween pop culture references, the video was removed some time in 2011 after it nearly 1.2 million views in March 2011. The video was reuploaded on March 27th, 2012, earning nearly 939,000 views as of November 2012. There are more than 15.6 thousand dislikes on the reuploaded video.      In early 2009, Tax Masters began running a series of 30-second spot commercials featuring Patrick Cox, the company's founder and spokesperson. In the commercials, Cox advertises his company as being openly willing to confront the Internal Revenue Services (IRS), claiming that his clients will get respect and fair treatment from the government. For the complete listings of his commercials, visit the company's website.[1] In early 2011, an image of Cox photoshopped in the style of the Shoop Da Whoop face began circulating on 4chan's /b/ (random) board, featuring GET instructions like "only quads can kill the tax master." In imageboard slang, a "quad" refers to an event in which the last four digits of a sequential post ID turn up identical (EX:80215555), a relatively rare phenomenon depending on the post cycle.    On July 27th, 2004, the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore[2] announced that it would be airing a new anti-piracy trailer in all screened cinemas in a joint initiative with the Motion Picture Association (MPA), which displays several different types of theft followed by a young girl downloading a pirated film. The PSA was subsequently included as an unskippable segment in the opening sequences of many DVDs. It was uploaded to YouTube by user avril134 on May 4th, 2006 (shown below). On January 24th, 2011, Matthew Inman, author of the webcomic The Oatmeal, published a post titled Winter 2010, the State of the Web (last modified January 25 2011), a series of illustrative commentaries poking fun at many well-known Internet-related websites and platforms like Facebook or even Apple. Among them was a peculiar illustration about Tumblr's downtimes and his proposal of green monster-like mascot called "Tumblbeast":  On December 29, 2009, a contestant by the name of Lolita McAuley appeared on "Wheel of Fortune". During the first round, McAuley tried to answer the puzzle with "Self Potato". The original poster for The Social Network was designed by LA-based designer Neil Kellerhouse and released on June 18th, 2010.    The keyword "Sad Truck" has been previously used to describe sightings of trucks on the road that resemble sad faces from a particular angle (also see: Things with Faces). For example, this instance hosted on FunnyJunk dates back to July 2010. The earliest image macro instance of "Sad Truck" began on Reddit in a thread titled "It's Okay Truck, Things Will Get Better" on March 21st, 2011. From the beginning, some Reddit users commented on its resemblance to Okay Guy and Sad Keanu.   The "Greetings Are Magic" ad campaign was first launched in July 2010 by AC Japan, a nonprofit organization that runs PSA commercials to raise awareness on various social issues and agendas (ex: prevention of bullying in schools, acting kindly towards the pregnant and elders, etc). Hello! (KonnichiWan!) = Konnichiwa (Good afternoon) + Wan(Bowwow / Dog) Thank you! (ArigatoUsagi!) = Arigatou (Thank you) + Usagi (Rabbit) Good evening! (KonbanWani!) = Konbanwa (Good evening) + Wani (Crocodile) Good bye! (SayonaRaion!) = Sayonara (Good bye) + Raion (Lion) Fun-loving friends suddenly appear by the magic of greeting words! (POPOPOPON) Good morning! (OhayoUnagi!) = Ohayou (Good morning) + Unagi (Japanese Eel) Let's eat! (ItadakiMausu!) = Itadakimasu (Let's eat) + Mausu (Mouse) The more we say hi, the more we can make friends. AC~ [Sound Logo] AC Japan's Greetings PSA has become also recognizable by its cutesy chorus line, which has been turned into the onomatopoeic catchphrase "POPOPOPON" (Japanese : ぽぽぽぽーん or ポポポポ～ン). On March 11th, 2011, an unprecedented scale of earthquakes, tsunami and nuclear power plant accident struck the nation of Japan. Unequivocally affected by this horrible disaster, many Japanese companies decided to withdraw their commercials from regular TV broadcast and had them substituted with AC Japan's public service announcements. The emergency broadcast of PSAs began around March 14th, heavily taking over the Japanese television. Unfortunately, many of them weren't quite suitable for a time of disaster, as they typically featured happy, upbeat music with smiling animated characters. Annoyed by their inappropriate nature, many Japanese viewers filed complaints and even threats to the TV stations, ultimately leading AC Japan to issue an official apology and promise revision to the clips[1]. The earliest known instance of an image macro using this caption was posted to FunnyJunk[3] on September 22nd, 2010. The caption was placed over an image of a boy with a freckled boy with a ginger afro and a double chin (shown below). As of August 2013, the image has received a score of 2260 and has been viewed more than 97,000 times.       The terms Rave, rave dance or rave party have documented use as far back as April 4, 1970. They refer to dance parties, and in 1980 'Acid house' parties, with fast-paced electronic music and light shows. People often dance to music played by DJs and occasionally live performers. Some of the genres of electronic dance music played include House, Trance, Electro House, UK Hardcore, Hardstyle, Drum and bass, Dubstep, Breakbeat, Hardcore techno, Funktronica, Psytrance and Jungle with the accompaniment of laser light shows, projected images and artificial fog. (Source Wikipedia : see link) In popular culture, rave parties are mainly characterized by the use of lightshow, glowsticks and drug abuse. Surgical mask guy, or in spanish "el tipo de la mascara" it's a meme that borns at an interview of CityTV news when the H1N1 was spreading in Colombia and they were covering how the citizens were cautious and how they were protecting from it. http://www.eltipodeltapabocas.com/ http://www.google.es/trends?q=el+tipo+del+tapabocas&date=2009&geo=all&ctab=0&sort=0&sa=N He also got an interview from SoHo. and facebook group. http://www.facebook.com/pages/El-Tipo-Del-Tapabocas/93668597842    It is a youtube video made by giancarloparimango11. It was uploaded on October 20, 2010. About five and a half months before it came out in the U.S. There is also another meme called simply "DENNIS" where it claims that a Pokemon song clearly says Dennis at 1:32 in the video. Images of "OH HAI KID" began circulating in mid-march 2011 on websites such as flickr, funnyjunk, and 4chan. It is unknown whether this meme started as a personal attack or an image randomly found on the internet. However it has been rumored many submissions contain factual information on the real identity of "OH HAI KID"    The exact origin of the phrase "I own a horse", such as who was the first to say it and when, is currently unknown. Research into this has proved difficult, as the meme generally is used on chat sites which are both anonymous and typically do not keep public archives of user's conversations. However, there have been several internet memes and viral videos that are similar in content, and may have acted as precursors to this meme. In this song by the Rubberbandits, posted on Youtube in 2010, they talk about how they "Have a horse outside", basically telling the other white trash in the video "Fuck your car, I own a horse". This is the first instance known where horse ownership is used to put others down, and is much closer in usage to the "I own a Horse" meme as the ownership of a horse is used to shut down others solicitations. Whether this is directly related to the earliest instances of the catchphrase is unknown. The meme in action generally looks something like this:  The exclamatory phrase "aww yea" was first registered on Urban Dictionary in September 2003: Sometime in December of 2010, someone posted a vectorized version of J. Jonah Jameson, Peter Parker's boss, from the popular film Spiderman 2 on Reddit.   According to League of Legends forum user GreenEyedMonster's explanation, "Huahue" and its variations, along with other phrases like "BR?" (are you Brazilian?) and "Gibe moni plos" ("give me money please) became widespread through the massively multi-player online game Ragnarok Online in 2003, which saw a "literal race war" break out between Brazilian players and an alliance of non-Portuguese speaking players. This sentiment is thought to be embodied in a webcomic portraying the Brazilian takeover of a massively multi-player online game, created by an unknown artist and posted to the Brazilian Arena IG forums[1] on September 24th, 2008.      The colloquial use of the phrase "I regret nothing" has been noted in modern historical documents and records, quoted by the former Nazi officer Adolf Eichmann in a 1960 interview with LIFE magazine while awaiting his trial in Israel. Als that year, French actress and singer Édith Piaf recorded a song titled "Non, je ne regrette rien," which translates to "No, I have no regrets" in English. More recently, the phrase was also quoted by a nameless character in a 1992 episode of The Simpsons, in which a guy falls through an opening drawbridge while waiting in line for the Itchy and Scratchy movie and yells "I regret nothing!" before hitting the water. On November 11th, 2008, a video titled "Roomba Driver" was uploaded by poutamo. One of the very first instances to take off was a YouTube video titled "Kitten Rides a Tortoise," uploaded by mountain462 on Oct 6th, 2009: The well known "Kitten Rides a Tortoise" video on YouTube led to a remake with the video to the tune of "Ridin' Dirty". This led to more videos of cats riding everything from Roombas to Rams.               On August 27, 2009, the Youtube user Schnockers[1] posted a video to his Youtube account entitled "Sandwich Calls on Heavy": The video grew in popularity, and has since gained over 40,000 views. The first response video was posted on September 12, 2009: Since then, "Sandwich Calls on Heavy" has received 55 video responses dealing with the "Calls On" content, with the overall amount far greater.  UCLA student Alexandra Wallace posted a rant about Asian students using cell phones in the library to YouTube on March 13th, 2011. In the video, Wallace states that she was annoyed by Asian parents washing their children's clothes and cooking their food and expresses irritation at Asian students using their cell phones in the library while performing a racially insensitive impersonation of Asian speech. The original video has since been taken down. Okay, so here at UCLA, it's finals week. So we know that I'm not the most politically correct person so don't take this offensively. I don't mean it toward any of my friends I mean it toward random people that I don't even know in the library. So, you guys are not the problem. The problem is these hordes of Asian people that UCLA accepts into our school every single year, which is fine. But if you're going to come to UCLA then use American manners. So it used to really bug me but it doesn't bother me anymore the fact that all the Asian people that live in all the apartments around me -- their moms and their brothers and their sisters and their grandmas and their grandpas and their cousins and everybody that they know that they've brought along from Asia with them – comes here on the weekends to do their laundry, buy their groceries and cook their food for the week. It's seriously, without fail. You will always see old Asian people running around this apartment complex every weekend. That's what they do. They don't teach their kids to fend for themselves. You know what they don't also teach them, is their manners. Which brings me to my next point. Hi, in America we do not talk on our cell phones in the library. I swear every five minutes I will be -- okay, not five minutes, say like fifteen minutes -- I'll be in like deep into my studying, into my political science theories and arguments and all that stuff, getting it all down, like typing away furiously, blah blah, blah, and then all of a sudden when I'm about to like reach an epiphany… Over here from somewhere, "Ooooh Ching Chong Ling Long Ting Tong, Ooohhhhh." Are you freaking kidding me? In the middle of finals week? So being the polite, nice American girl that my momma raised me to be, I kinda just gave him what anybody else would do that kinda like, [puts finger up to lips in a "shh" motion]. "You know it's a library, like, we're trying to study, thanks!" And then it's the same thing five minutes later. But it's somebody else, you know -- I swear they're going through their whole families, just checking on everybody from the tsunami thing. I mean I know, okay, that sounds horrible like I feel bad for all the people affected by the tsunami, but if you're gonna go call your address book like you might as well go outside because if something is wrong you might really freak out if you're in the library and everybody's quiet like you seriously should go outside if you're gonna do that. So, thanks for listening, that was my rant. I just -- even if you're not Asian you really shouldn't be on your cell phone in the library but I've just never seen that happen before so thank you for listening and have a nice day.  The series uses an image of Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden from the 1999 hit cult film Fight Club. In the story, Tyler Durden promotes anarchy and mayhem by sabotaging various companies as acts of defiance against consumerism with his operation known as "Project Mayhem."[1][2] On January 4th, 2011, Reddit user ThatDrunkViking posted a thread on the r/AdviceAnimals subreddit titled “Helpful Tyler Durden”.[3] The post consisted of a compilation Helpful Tyler Durden instances on a green color wheel background, which received 2,759 up votes. The series of images had watermarks from Memegenerator.net, suggesting that the macros may have originated from the site. The video was first uploaded to YouTube on March 14th, 2011 and was subsequently posted to Reddit[1] in a thread titled "Child finally snaps after being bullied." YouTube quickly removed the video for violating the Terms of Service because it contained violent footage involving minors, but several copies were re-uploaded with alternative titles. Some viewers began referring to Heynes as the "Zangief Kid" since the grappling move he used closely resembles the signature "Spinning Piledriver" [2] special throw for the character Zangief in the Street Fighter video game series.   The first instance of the image macro[1] was posted by Reddit user hannahisapalindrome depicting two photos of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, one at the young age and another one at the older age, on February 8th, 2011. The comics typically use the structure of Cereal Guy's reaction to the pre-fame or childhood photograph of a celebrity, followed by Cereal Guy's "food-spitting" reaction to the glamorous photograph of the same celebrity. Prior to this series, unflattering "before-and-after" comparisons of celebrity photographs have been explored on the Korean web in the early 2000s, largely driven by the growth of anti-fan communities. Fist of the North Star (北斗の拳 Hokuto no Ken) is a Japanese manga authored by Buronson (Yoshiyuki Okamura) and Tetsuo Hara and published by Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1983 to 1988. In the series, Kenshiro is the sole successor (along with very few practitioners) of Hokuto Shinken (Divine Fist of the North Star), an extremely lethal martial art which involves attacking adversaries at their hidden pressure points. The original manga in Japanese was published by Weekly Shonen Jump from 1983 to 1988 and its TV anime series aired from 1984 to 1987. The English-translated manga was first published in 1989, reprinted as a single-volume graphic novel in 1995 and the Master Edition was published as nine volume set from 2002 to 2003.                 in 1998 4kids acquired the rights to distribute the Pokemon anime in the United States. While this was a commerical success, fans were outraged by the heavy editing of the anime, most notably removing Onigiri, or Japanese Rice Balls, and replacing them with sandwiches or other "Americanized" foods as seen here: On October 18, 2006. Youtube user SharinganProductions uploaded the following video to show his hypothetical thoughts on what would happen if 4Kids acquired the rights to Naruto, this would be the first instance of the "What if 4Kids got X" meme:                The scene is originated from the 18th episode in season 2 from the Nickelodeon series The Fairly OddParents titled Deja Vu. The scene is set up with Timmy's parents explaining why they must go. This blue-haired unicorn originally appeared in the first season's episode "Suited for Success," as a DJ at the fashion show hosted by one of main characters Rarity. Although the character was seen on-screen for less than 5 seconds, her unique design and cool attitude left a distinct impression on the fans for greater period of time. Soon after the broadcast on February 4th, 2011, single topic blog Equestria Daily[1] published a poll on February 9th, asking readers to choose the character's unofficial fan name: The poll resulted in a tie between DJ P0n-3 and Scratch; the character was given the nickname "Scratch" and the stagename "DJ P0N-3" (generally written only in capital letters). Later on, her name was extended to Vinyl Scratch by Equestria Daily and 4chan's fanbase. This was due in part to the naming convention typically given to characters of the show and was inspired by the DJ mixing art known as "Scratching."[6] As with other beloved background characters who were given fan nicknames, her popularity inspired fan illustrations and anthropomorphic drawings made in tribute to her. The commercial was first introduced to western audiences when the fansubbing group [gg] intentionally left the commercial in when they released their version of the episode.[2] The commercial became very popular among the Puella Magi fandom and people began creating fanworks for the commercial. In the fanworks, usually one of the characters is endorsing the drink or is being awkwardly rescued by a man in an orange jump suit repelling from the ceiling. There are also a number of YouTube poop and MAD videos involving Morning Rescue. Even though Morning Rescue is a minor meme, the commercial became so influential that websites, such as J-list, started having the product for sale due to popular demand.[3] One blog stated that the owner of the website tweeted that the drink was selling very well. This same blog proposed the idea of whether fansub groups could be used positively by promoting businesses rather than harming them.[4]     On February 27th, 2011, during the South Beach Wine & Food Festival, Food Network’s celebrity chefs Paula Deen[1]and Robert Irvine[2] were co-hosting the Whole Foods Market Grand Tasting Event when Irvine got down on all fours and Deen sat on his back, mimicking the pose of a jockey while holding a glass of wine.  On February 24th, 2011, Charlie Sheen called into The Alex Jones Show[1] radio program to talk about his views on Alcoholics Anonymous and the future of his sitcom Two and a Half Men[22], which has been put on production hiatus since Sheen's hospitalization in late January 2011. During the phone interview, the actor lashed out against his colleague / executive producer Chuck Lorre as "AA Nazi" and "blatant hypocrite," while calling the show a "pukefest that everyone worships." In response to Sheen's assail against the producer of "Two and a Half Men," CBS and Warner Bros have announced that they are canceling production for the rest of the season. The show had been on production hiatus since January 2011 after Sheen was hospitalized and put into rehabilitation for substance addiction. Prior to entering medical care earlier this year, New York Post[2] reported in October 2010 about Charlie Sheen's arrest and hospitalization after a night of "destructive partying" at a hotel in New York city.    Though its exact point or date of origin remains unknown, the mash-up was most likely inspired by the similarity between the two names, Barack and Brock. The earliest known iteration on the web can be attributed to a YTMND page from February 2008.[1] However, the meme began to gain recognition due to YouTube videos uploaded in November 2008.    The FAILblog video "Couch Mover FAIL" was uploaded via YouTube on February 21st, 2011: In the comment section, YouTuber MrMal posted: "Co za asy…" As of Feb 28th, it has over 200 mentions of the phrase only 4 days after it is introduced to the internet.  The first known example of dubstep used ironically in a video is a Little Superstar derivative from Jul 27, 2008:      The original comic, Mr. Matsubayashi was posted by linoc on DeviantArt in 2006. The comic began with "MR. Matsubayashi is having a very bad day."  On November 16th, 2001, fantasy film Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone premiered in the United States.[1] In one scene of the film, character Hagrid reveals to main character Harry Potter that he is a wizard and is to study in Hogwarts (scene shown below), to which Harry responds "I'm a what?" - You're a wizard, Harry. - I'm a what? On July 16th, 2009, YouTube[2] user thejess11 made the earliest known upload of the clip to YouTube (video no longer available). On October 31st, 2009, YouTube[3] user Snag Prophet posted the earliest found remix based on the clip, a This Is Sparta remix (shown below) that received over 66,000 views in 12 years.       The series is believed to have originated from the single topic blog Fuck Yeah Art Student Owl[1], which was launched by School of Visual Arts student and Tumblr user Kendra on February 22nd, 2011. The first image posted on the blog was captioned with "this product is known to be carcinogenic, better paint with it":  The original panel reused in the meme comes from a Japanese pornographic manga called "Pay Back" by artist Jun Nitta (にったじゅん), in which two schoolgirls are making fun of a boy when they find out he is a virgin: Transcript: The initial adult manga was released on July 2002.    In 2010, Gong Linna performed “Tan Te” in the 2010 Beijing Chinese New Year Concert. The vidio of her performance was uploaded to Renren in the following May. Here’s the “translated” lyrics: The first instances of Drawgirl on 4chan were found on /int/, 4chan's "International" board for cross-cultural exchanges. Maki Badfox, a "drawfag" on 4chan, is thought to be the original artist, although this has not been confirmed. In early 2011, at the time when Drawgirl was first gaining popularity, Maki was estranged from the community, making it somewhat unlikely that she was the artist that made Drawgirl.    On February 24th, 2011, the original Karate Kyle photo was uploaded to James Von Helton's Facebook[1] page. While no archived threads exist, it is rumored to have spread to 4chan shortly afterward. The first Reddit[2] post including the Karate Kyle photo wth the caption "They broke my pencils / I broke their necks" was submitted on February 25th, 2011 but had no mention of the name "Karate Kyle". The second Reddit thread[3] titled "Introducing Karate Kyle" later that day with a round-up of Karate Kyle image macros.    The term, the symbol and the catchphrase all originate from the hentai manga The Light of Tsukimi Manor (月見草のあかり) by Inuboshi (犬星), which was first published in the September 2010 volume of COMIC MEGAMILK (コミックメガミルク). The manga depicts a young girl, Akari, being tricked into having sex with three students.  In 2008, Maxis, the creators and developers of the Sims series of video games, released Spore, a multi-genre single player "god game" for PC that allows users to create and interact with different alien species as they evolve to become a dominant life form and eventually a space captain. The following year, an expansion pack was released called Spore: Galactic Adventures, which players can use to develop short "adventures," or levels consisting of player-generated environments, creatures, buildings, and vehicles. Through http://www.spore.com, adventures and their components can be shared online. To get users started, Maxis released several of its own adventures, including three starring unlucky best friends Clark and Stanley. In each adventure, the two attempt seemingly harmless activities but end up making a mistake that humorously and exaggeratedly causes their deaths. Due to the simple formula pioneered by these levels, players began to make their own adventures starring Clark and Stanley. There is now an enormous amount of these levels shared on Spore.com. Though many users criticize their simplicity and frequent bad spelling and grammar, many C&S adventures are unique and humorous. Clark and Stanley haters have formed a group on the Spore forum, and some have created anti-Clark and Stanley adventures, such as "Clark and Stanley-The Real Story" by Jaconan. Many fan artworks featuring the characters can be found on <a href=“http://www.deviantart.com/” >Deviantart. Here are examples of typical Clark and Stanley searches on Spore: On November 12th, 2007, YouTuber PiratesGurl4 posted a video of herself creating fake bans on Club Penguin, gaining over 38,000 views (shown below).  The drawing is based on a stillshot photograph of Yao Ming captured from a post-game press conference in May 2009. At :18 in the video below, the athlete is seen making the face after his teammate Ron Artest leaves the site of interview. On July 11th, 2010, a Reddit[1] post was submitted by artist “downlow”[2] which featured numerous drawings he had created for rage comics that were never used, including the Yao Ming drawing. In the same thread[3], downlow confirmed that the drawing was based on a screen capture of Ming from the press conference in May. Redditor alkalait replied to the thread remarking that it appeared as if Yao Ming was saying "bitch please."  The Libyan leader's Tuesday speech was broadcast by news agencies across the world on the same day. Among those who watched Gaddafi's emotional speech was Noy Alooshe, 31 year old Israeli journalist and musician, who saw its potential for autotune and set the footage to "Hey Baby" by hiphop artists Pitbull and T-Pain. Alooshe's remix, titled "Zenga Zenga" after Gaddafi's rhetorical lines, was uploaded on February 24th and entered mass circulation via Twitter and Facebook. The clip instantly went viral, gaining over 2.7 million views within the first week.  The original image comes from the sports satire show Crackòvia, broadcast in Catalonia, Spain, in a gag where Josep Lluís Núñez (Carlos Latre) participes in Who Wants to Be Millonaire, being asked which was the name of the city that homes FC Barcelona, withdrawing because he didn't know the answer. On February 11th, 2011, user GAGO uploaded to the Spanish-language Internet humor website Cuanto Cabrón a comic with a vectorized version of Latre's face with the catchphrase "It's Free". In the comic, the main character is offered free coffee samples on a supermarket, accepting them as they are free.[3] The comic has recieved over 9000 votes on 4 years. The earliest known use of Girls Laughing response images appeared in a thread[1] on 4chan's /tv/ (Television) board on August 4th, 2009. After the original poster asked for opinions about the 1954 drama teleplay 12 Angry Men, a series of different images of women laughing paired with green text captions were used to criticize the OP's positive opinion of the movie. Though many different photos are used, the photo that is most often associated with this practice, used in in the first reply, is a Getty Images[2] stock photo titled "Young Women Laughing in a Photo Booth."         On April 6th, 2010, an anonymous user posted a creepypasta story titled "Squidward’s Suicide" to 7chan's /x/ (paranormal) board.[3] Narrated by the author who claims to have seen the lost episode during his internship at Nickelodeons Studios, the story opens with the show's production team reviewing what was supposed to be the premiere episode for the fourth season, but as the footage progresses, the animators and editors become horrified by gory imageries and ghostly sound effects that weren't authorized to be included. On November 29th, 2009, now-deleted Redditor u/HalfDemon1122 posted a Rage Comic to /r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu depicting someone trying to troll Omegle users by posing as the FBI (shown below). In the second panel, a character who appears to be holding back laughter, represented by a string of letters starting with "PFFFTTTCHH," is shown. The post gained over 300 upvotes in 12 years and is the earliest known use of the character in a Rage Comic. It is unclear if the poster created the face. The face was highly praised by commenters, seeing it as an excellent addition to Rage Faces (example comments shown below). The face is likely a tracing based on a yellow emote sharing the identical emotion known as the "Plz" emote (shown below). On December 9th, 2009, Deviant Art[1] user Plz-database posted the emote, offering the earliest known live upload of it, but not pre-dating the first "PFFFTTTCHH" Rage Comic. One of the earliest mentions of the phrase "Are you a wizard?" online comes from the webcomic “Left Handed Toons”[7] in a comic titled “Wizard Time” (shown below, left) posted on June 19th, 2009. In early 2010, a MemeGenerator page was created for "Are You a Wizard," featuring a photograph of a mustachioed man wearing glasses with the caption "Are you a wizard?" (shown below, right). The original Meme Generator page has since been removed.   On February 18th, 2011, Radiohead released their 8th studio album The King of Limbs along with their official music video for the single "Lotus Flower." Directed by Garth Jennings and choreographed by Royal Ballet's Wayne McGregor, the black and white music video features an unusual dance performance by the lead singer Thom Yorke. Upon its release, the music video for "Lotus Flower" was generally met by positive reaction from the fans and music bloggers, many of whom commented on Thom Yorke's melancholic dance scene. Super Mario Kart was released for the Super Nintendo console on August 27th, 1992, becoming the third best selling SNES game of all time with over 8 million copies sold worldwide. The game was followed by several sequels over the next 30 years, including Mario Kart 64 (1996), Mario Kart: Double Dash!! (2003), Mario Kart DS (2005), Mario Kart Wii (2008) and Mario Kart 7(2011). The earliest known live action Mario Kart parody was uploaded by YouTuber ewenx012 on April 29th, 2006, in which a group of students race around a school building in Mario Kart-themed costumes (shown below).     The wall of text reaction image phenomenon began around the former half of 2010 on 4chan's /jp/ board parodying the typical insult style of certain tripcode users, but many of them have spread across boards such as /v/ and /mu/; the most popular being : These images consisted of anime characters (due to the origin being /jp/) but they have since developed into anything from Micheal Cera to a man standing behind a stack of Dragonball Z VHS tapes. Most insults contain phrases like "buttowned" or "buttdevastated"..            "Chemtrail" is a portmanteau of the words "chemical" and "contrail," and believers in the theory say that a chemtrail can be differentiated from a regular contrail based on its length. First discussed in the 1990s, after a theoretical United States Military white paper discussed methods for controlling the weather in the year 2025, the theory of chemtrails has always been denied by the United States Government, who released their first detailed statement on the topic in 1996.[1] Aircraft, engines, chaff, and flares can produce a variety of condensation patterns (or contrails), exhaust plumes, vapor trails, or smoke patterns. The exhaust emissions produced by aircraft and space launch vehicles can produce contrails that look very similar to clouds which can last for only a few seconds or as long as several hours. Vapor trails are formed only under certain atmospheric conditions and create a visible atmospheric wake similar to a boat propeller in water and usually dissipate very rapidly. Chaff and flares produce unique smoke patterns that are visibly different than a contrail but have the same color and appearance as a cloud but which also typically dissipates very quickly. Aerial spraying for pest or weed control and fire suppression are the only Air Force activities which involve aircraft intentionally spraying chemical compounds (insecticides, herbicides, fire retardants, oil dispersants). In the case of an in-flight emergency, jet fuel may be released to lighten the landing weight and minimize the risk of fire if the aircraft should crash. The original image appeared on a Brazilian Humor site known as DENTRO DA CAVEIRA that first had the captions mention that the female telling the male that she's pregnatn, and the male beating her for being a pedophile. Original Image               In the early-to-mid-90s, numerous motion pictures used the song on their soundtrack. The 1993 adaptation of Super Mario Bros. featured a version of the song performed by The Goombas and featuring recording artist George Clinton (music video below, left).[2] The following year, the song appeared on the soundtrack for the 1994 adaptation of The Flintstones. [3] On July 1st, 2009, 20th Century Fox released the film Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs in the United States.[4] Ahead of the film's release, on June 19th, YouTuber elhabibpatrick posted a music video for a cover version of the song by Queen Latifa, included on the film's soundtrack. within 12 years, the post received more than 1.1 million views (shown below, right). On February 13th, 2011, Emmy-award winning KCBS reporter Serene Branson[2] was slated to give a recap of the highlights of the 53rd Grammy Awards, when she suddenly began garbling her words in unintelligible manner. “Well a very, very heavay a heavy drit, burtation tonight, We had a very dairse, darrison…but let’s go ahead tearis tasin losh flabette bahend the pet." Immediately after the camera cut to recorded footage, Branson was examined by paramedics[3] and a co-worker escorted her home. Branson supposedly confirmed she was not hospitalized after the incident via Twitter, but the account was later suspended.[4]       The resource of his video remix fad is a promoting video for CR Matsuken Samba 2 that is a machine for Japanese popular gambling pachinko[2] released by the Japanese company FUJISHOJI in 2006. This machine features Matsuken Samba II[3] that is 2004 big hit tune by the Japanese famous period drama actor Ken Matsudaira[4] and is famous for its eccentric live staging. Shigeki Majima is the choreographer of this song. So, he played a promoting role of this pachinko machine to express the excitement of this pachinko machine by his dancing. In this video, he is waving his crotch passionately and shouting "Paa-Paa-Tinko!" continually. For the public, his dance is to present the excitement provided by this machine. However, his behavior apparently looks like an awful dirty joke to many Japanese because "Tinko" (or "Chinko") means "Penis" in Japanese.  On the day before Omar Soliman's announcement on February 11th, 2011, the Egyptian army announced that "all of the protestors' demands will be met." On that day, Mubarak made a speech, announcing that he would delegate his authoritative powers down to Vice President Omar Soliman, but would not step down from the office. This announcement, of course, frustrated the protesters' in Egypt and elsewhere like Yemen and Jordan. Also see: Bread Helmet Guy. On the 18th day of protests, Soliman announced that he was going to make an emergency statement. As Egyptians everywhere anxiously huddled around their television sets to listen to the statement they had all been waiting for, many viewers' couldn't help but notice the highly distressed looking man standing behind the vice president. The photoshop meme began on the official Facebook page titled "We all love The Guy Behind Omar Suleiman بنحب الراجل اللى ورا عمرسليمان" on February 14th, 2011. The man behind Omar Soliman was later identified as Major Sherif Hussein of the Egyptian special forces' Unit 64, according to the Egyptian Chronicles blog.[1]  On January 1st, 2011, Something Awful forum user Apple Jax posted a picture of her boyfriend Daniel Vecchitto's cat Emilio[1] in a thread titled "PYF Cat Pictures (it rises again). When the photo was taken, Emilio the cat was wearing a tie he had received for Christmas from Etsy shop Whisker Kisses.[6] Three days later, the photo was reposted to Reddit[3] with the title "Business Cat." Several hours later, the image was put on MemeGenerator[5] and a second Reddit thread[4] entitled "Business Cat ain't no joke" marked the first appearance of the image macro, captioned "No LOL here, Get your ass in my office."  The meme comes from a webcomic entitled 'tactics' published by Nedroid comics on the 29th of January 2011. In the comic the father is playing the "Wheres Mommy/Daddy" routine, when the son Jeffy is asked "wheres Bin Laden?" to Jeffys shock. This comical ending, merging the innocence of a baby, with Bin Laden, sparked a fast paced chain reaction of re-edits on FunnyJunk.com and other Image sharing websites.  On September 18, 2010, Pokémon Black and White were released in Japan. However, the games' soundtracks had already been leaked prior to that release date. Once the games' soundtracks were uploaded to YouTube, those who listened to Ghetsis' battle theme noticed its Latin chanting. It says "Ghetis", although some people misheard that and thought that the voices said "Dennis". This started the phenomenon. The chanting can be heard in the above video, from 1:32 onward.      This video starts with the Bill O'Reilly "Tides go in, tides go out" and "You can't explain that!" skits, then Neil Tyson walks in and says "Actually, Stephen, I can." This video was posted on Colbert Nation's website on January 6, 2011.     One of the earliest known images comes from a photo of a man wearing a keffiyeh that was posted to the Arabic Graaam[1] forum on August 12th, 2007. The first known instance of the image with the "whatcha thinkin bout" caption was published in a post on the web culture blog UpRoxx[2] on August 5th, 2010. In 2008, Chinese video hosting service Youku[2] user 篆毫[3] started uploading videos of the voice actors from "3000 Whys of Blue Cat" and their lectures. The most notable video, uploaded on September 14th, 2008[4], was that of Ge Ping, the voice actor for Lan Mao up until late 2005: Ge Ping's exaggerated intonations and facial expressions, as well as nostalgia factors are what make this specific video open to parody. His description of the bald child and the phrase, "Watching Blue Cat, Learning from Blue Cat, I can say I am proud to have been with Blue Cat," have become reoccuring jokes within Chinese video-sharing site communities.   The term /b/lackup originated on 4chan's /b/ boards, during the so-called "Habbo Wars". These were organized raids by Anonymous, who would create a black avatar wearing a grey suit and an afro hairstyle, they would then go and block the entrance to the pool, a popular zone in Habbo Hotel. When there weren't enough /b/rothers to create the blockade, one would post a topic on /b/ requesting /b/lackup, i.e., help from fellow /b/rothers. This derived in a "demotivational" poster, with two of the avatars used for the raids high-fiving. "Habbo Wars"  On the January 4th, 2011[8] episode of The O'Reilly Factor, Bill O'Reilly[10] interviewed American Atheists[7] president Dave Silverman about a billboard[9] the company had put up arguing that religion was a scam. When Silverman asked for proof of a god's existence, O'Reilly argued that he knew because the tide comes in and out regularly without fail, and it could not be explained without divine intervention. Silverman's facial expression after this statement was the inspiration for the Are You Serious? rage face. The first image macro featuring the quote "You can't explain that" was posted to Reddit[11] on February 9th, 2011. It received 9505 upvotes and 2083 points overall.    The first "niggerwalk" comics were first spotted on /new/ (news) board in November of 2010. After the discontinuation of /new/ on January 18th, 2011, the comics disappeared for several weeks before returning on the /b/ (random) board in February. The original instances of the series depict a street encounter between white and black pedestrians where the black guy intimidates the white guy by taunting him, inspiring the white guy to post a message on /new/ about how much he despises black people in revenge. The purpose of the comic is to illustrate the differences between the actions and words of a typical 4chan user.     The Tumblr blog STFUParents[6] is widely cited for popularizing the term "mommyjacking." On March 13th, 2009, the blog began highlighting social media posts made by parents who overshare or interrupt threads with information about their children. Another meme that came out of team fortress 2 is crates. crates are items that can be found by playing team fortress 2 they are free to find but cost money to open (2.50$ U.S) upon opening one you can either get a weapon or hat or you have a 0.5 percent chance of getting an unusual hat because of this many people post there unboxing on youtube were they usually unbox no unusual after spending a ton of money on crates… https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LWpy-hjibA https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo40ALvIBzc&feature=related https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLwzinCoA7w&feature=related   The character which the catchphrase is usually associated is Manami Amamiya, protagonist of the series "Gakuen Utopia Manabi Straight!", from which a TV anime was produced in 2007 [1]. Epic Head Bobbing Guy comes from the animated movie Aladin, created by the German film studio Dingo Pictures. He started popping up on the internet around May 26th, 2009, when YouTube user deckman92 created the YouTube Poop "ALADIN BREAKS HIS SUPERFINGER". Epic Head Bobbing Guy can be seen at 0:47: Jack's exgirlfriend uploaded dozens of images to Memegenerator and managed to take over the Google images page for the search term "Jack Weppler". After a complaint thread was started on Google Webmaster Help (the thread has been removed) by Jack's mother, the story was picked up by blog sites.    YesYes was created in March of 2006 by YTMND user named Doubly. Bascically what Doubly did was make an alternate universe to another universe. When YesYes was created, then the meme of the YTMND alternate Universe was created. Unfortunately, YesYes couldn't compete with PTKFGS, but in July of the same year it managed to gain popularity again. Google Insights  Titled "Selling 8 Beyblades to replace destroyed baththub," the auction page was posted on February 5th by eBay user daney21. According to the auction description, the user explains how her two young boys (as depicted in the photo) had caused so much destruction to the bathtub that she forced them to sell the toys to help pay for the damage. In the image attached, the older son appears to be crying alongside his very solemn-looking brother who holds the Beyblades up for the camera in a Ziploc bag. On February 5th, the photograph started receiving attention quickly, earning an article dedicated to the story on Kotaku. However, initial blog coverage of this quirky eBay episode was rather minuscule in comparison to what was transpiring on 4chan, particularly in the /b/ board. With the photo of the boys just begging to be "shopped," 4chan users began creating several different variations and posting them on the image board.    The term "supercut" was coined by blogger Andy Baio on April 11th 2008. In the original post[1], Baio described a supercut as: In the blog post, Baio cites a YouTube video titled "Previously on Lost : What?" as an example of a Supercut, which was uploaded on April 3rd, 2008: Following the Egyptian "Arab Spring"[2] demonstrations against the 30-year incumbent president Mubarak that began on January 25th, 2011, the anti-government sentiment spread across the border to Yemen sparking a nationwide protest known as "Day of Rage." During the opposition-led street demonstrations in Sanna on February 3rd, 2011, several Yemeni protesters began wearing makeshift protective armor and headgear to shield themselves from police forces and random projectiles. Reuters reporter Khaled Abdullah managed to photograph a protester yelling with his hands raised up high in the air wearing bread tied to his head. The Gundam Series[] is a colonial space anime series featuring giant mecha robots called "Mobile Suits" (MS), which are operated by human pilots. The protagonist's mobile suit is usually designated Gundam. Since its on-air debut on April 7, 1979 as a serial TV show, Mobile Suit Gundam has become an internationally popular franchise with titles in form of TV series, films, manga and videogames. In the middle of December 2010, a Japanese TV news reported that a standing robot statue looking alike Gundam was revealed in Floraland (国色天乡乐园) in Sichuan, China. The news report pointed to the statue's resemblance to the Japanese Gundam model: In this same report, Floraland official responded with the following statement: This news was subsequently reported by English online news sites such as Kotaku.[2] The news made headlines across Japanese online communities and many began referring to the Floraland robot as "中華ガンダム" (Chinese Gundam), "チャイダム" (Chi-dam) or "偽ガンダム" (Nise Gundam, lit. Fake Gundam), mocking the display as a low-quality imitation of the 18-meters tall Gundam replica statue previously installed in Odaiba district of Tokyo in July 2009: A few days following the news report, Floraland robot was suddenly removed from the site for safety reasons and renovation.[3] Around January 30th, 2011, several Japanese and English news sites, such as Anime News Network[4], Kotaku[5] and CrunchGear[6], reported that Floraland completed the Chinese robot and put it back on public display, insisting that their newly-renovated Chinese model was an original design. TV news coverage began in early February 2011. On this report, Floraland released a statement saying "The robot is designed by ourselves. There is no rights violation." Later, it was revealed that new Chinese Gundam's name was "天郷2号" (Tian-xiang-er-hao). But, it's uncertain whether if first Chinese Gundam's name was "天郷1号" (Tian-xiang-yī-hao). Surprised by Floraland's insistence, Japanese media, Gundam fans and anime blogs criticized the redesigned Tian-xiang as still unoriginal and monstrous looking. However, some Otaku groups took interest in the heavily-altered design of Tian-xiang 2 and began exchanging remixes, concept designs and other tributes to the Sichuan Gundam.    The original image comes from a stock photograph titled "Elderly Woman Looking at Computer Screen" taken on December 21st, 2005.[1] On February 4th, 2011, several Redditors posted image macros featuring the stock photo, referring to the advice animal character as "Internet Grandma."[2][3][4] The captions referenced various shock sites and Internet memes, including 2 Girls 1 Cup, circle jerk and lemon party.  Originally, Dr. Lee Ka-yan released a song in 2001, called “Siu Ming Siu Ming Siu Siu Ming” (Chinese:小明小明小小明), which has a theme of Siu Ming taking a train and goes all around the mainland China. Note: The map of China in this MV had also produced lulz as it includes North and South Korea. (0:22) Lyrics translated in English:      Originally the phrase was commonly taught to young children as a way to avoid sexual harassment from others. Online, its popularity can likely be traced to the Family Guy episode "He's Too Sexy For His Fat" which originally aired on June 27th, 2000.      CrisXcruX's MySpace page[1] was created sometime in 2009, with his earliest uploads of profile pictures dating to August 11th, 2009. The original profile image depicted a gloomy middle-aged man taking an iPhone picture of himself in front of a mirror at an angle, which was eventually turned into the default template for "Emo Dad" image macros. As of September 2012, the identity of CrisXcruX remains unknown.  On November 11th, 2010[7], 4chan's random image board /b/ declared war on Tumblr with Operation Overlord for their trolling on anonymous chat site Omegle. Anonymous members began spamming shock images to the site and orchestrating DDoS attacks with a special application called a Low Orbit Ion Cannon.[1] The raid managed to temporarily bring down the home page of Tumblr, although individual blogs continued to function. In retaliation, Tumblr users posted multiple threads of cat pictures to /b/ the same day, calling this counterattack Operation Overkitten.[2] While it seemed to have little effect, several of 4chan's moderators felt that Anonymous members had crossed the line with this attack and caused all new threads made on /b/ to 404 upon creation. Because of the mods taking away the ability to create threads, many 4chan users decided they would rather take advantage of Tumblr's stereotypical hipster female userbase and turn the raid in to a romance. Referred to as "4chumblr" or "4chumbler," several threads appeared on 4chan over the next few weeks, including written fan-fiction[3] and cartoon versions of the sites[4] interacting with each other.  Google search queries for "troll dad" began to surge some time around July 2009. The earliest uses of troll dad can be traced to Reddit[1] circa June 2010.  The phrase “what is air?” was used on Tumblr as early as September 19th, 2010[7] to express the feeling of laughing so hard, one’s breath is lost.[6] On November 8th, 2010, the phrase was included in an Urban Dictionary definition for the phrase “Tumblr Cancer”[8] as an example of phrases Tumblr users will say to fit in with one another. The following day, a second Urban Dictionary definition was added for “What is air?”[3], which described its use as similar to HNNG on 4chan. The Dragoon is a game unit in the StarCraft franchise, a series that is wildly popular in Korea. StarCraft Wiki gives us a rundown of the Dragoon: In 2005, catoonist Kim Seong Mo (김성모) released his rendition of the popular StarCraft franchise. As Korean netizens began noticing his habit of drawing overly dramatic close-ups of characters, one particular scene caught their attention:   While anthropomorphism has been around for a long time, it was usually only done to animals or other living things since they were already identifiable as a form of life. However, the practice of anthropomorphizing inanimate objects, specifically programs, did not occur until much later on 2channel. In 2001, Shiitake-chan was made. She was an anthropomorphic interpretation of the Internet Explorer "Stop" button. Eventually, other aspects of internet browsing were given "Moe" forms, most noticeably other web browsers. Around the same time, deviantArt was holding a contest to find a mascot for their website. The winner of the contest, a user by the name of "switched" won the contest with his submission of "Fella", who was inspired solely on the idea that people on deviantArt should be as devious as the site's name implies. Fella was different from other website mascots because he had a distinct personality. He became more than just deviantArt's mascot, he became its face. With both characters spreading around the web, both west and east had their own idea of what an anthropomorphic website was like. Japan and Korea made their websites with an anime feel to them, while the Americas and Europe were giving mascots more human-like personalities. In 2003, the website, "Go-Gaia" was made, which would later be known as "Gaia Online". It was a forum-based community that was known most for the customizable avatars that visitors could dress up with outfits bought using gold received from interacting with other users. People began to create "avatar art". This practice, along with Gaia Online's interesting storyline, made the Gaia avatars the first widely drawn website characters.   In the Spring 1995 Patagonia outdoor wear catalog, the company featured. a photograph by Greg Epperson featuring a man and woman tossing a bag across a chasm (shown below, left).[1] The earliest available version of the photoshopped version appeared on the /r/pics Reddit on January 23rd, 2011. That day, Redditor[2] RocketRobinhood received more than 1,300 points (95% upvoted) and 495 comments in eight years (shown below, right).   On January 14th, 2008, a British animator named Edd Gould, creator of Eddsworld, released a video starring himself and his companions' alter-egos "dancing" in tune to the song 'No' by Vim. As of October of 2011, the video has gained over 3 million views and nearly 2,000 likes. The popularity of the video (along with the catchiness of the song) led to many parodies being made.  On October 19th, 2007, the Internet humor blog The Sneeze[1] published an article titled "The Great Pizza Orientation Test," which featured screenshots of a custom pizza order testing to see if they would properly fulfill his requests (shown below). In 2004, a portion of an IRC log was submitted to Bash, a website which records humorous or odd IM or IRC conversations.[1] In it, a user by the name of AzureDiamond was tricked into giving away his password, which was hunter2.[2] The exact date of upload is unknown, but the first recorded date in the Wayback Machine was June 4th, 2004.[3] A copy of the original bash.org chat transcript: On January 27th 2011, The Washington Post featured a front page article about a severe snowstorm that struck Washington D.C. and the rest of U.S. East Coast, accompanied by dozen of photographs. Among them were a photograph of an annoyed looking pedestrian with an ice cream cone running across the intersection of 15th and L streets in downtown D.C., taken by photographer Ricky Carioti. That same day, Redditor JPEGBundy submitted an unedited version of the Washington Post photograph in a post ittled "I feel that the world will be a better place if this picture gets the Photoshop treatment." 4chan, specifically the /tg/ board of traditional gaming (which concerns non-video game games like board games, tabletop games, RPGs, etc.), has made several custom factions and armies of their own through out the years for the tabletop game Warhammer 40,000, most notably the Adeptus Astartes or commonly known as the Space Marines; Genetically enhanced supersoldiers of the Imperium of Man. In January 2011, McDonald Japan released a set of Sponge Bob toys for the Happy Meal combo and launched a rambunctious TV commercial[1]. The ad campaign was officially named "Sponge Bob: Absolutely Surprising (スポンジ・ボブ ハチャメチャびっくり編)".   This meme sometimes comes up in chat when playing Team Fortress 2. Supposedly, they were originally misspellings in the chat by young children, although sometimes the names are used to make fun of the associated class.          This phrase originates from 2007 game "S.T.A.L.K.E.R: Shadow of Chernobyl"[1], in which every time the player passes near or tries to interact with a guard of the "Duty" faction, the NPC would say "Get out of here, Stalker!", which would be his only line, and at times he would repeat the phrase several times over and over. The place where the NPC is located, is a rather major area of the game, so players would have pass through it multiple times, and the guard would repeat the same phrase every time.  In Hong Kong, when typhoon signal no. 8 or a higher signal is hoisted, all schools and work will be suspended ( the typhoon signal system in Hong Kong). However, no matter how strong the wind and how heavy the rain was, typhoon signal no. 8 were never being hoisted during August 2004 to July 2007. While the citizens are starting to complain about the Hong Kong Observatory (called as HKO below) not protecting the citizens in time, a scholar from a university spoke in a news report on television, that “Hong Kong loses 400 million dollars (HKD) every time a typhoon hits it. Who is going to bare the responsibility for the 400 million?” Then somebody searched on the internet and found that Hong Kong Observatory was attached the former Economic Development and Labor Bureau (called as “EDLB” below) of the Hong Kong government. People started to mock about HKO’s decision are leaning to the commercial circles in the society for earning money, meanwhile ignoring the safety of the citizens. At last, the rage was shot to the biggest boss in Hong Kong, Li (he owns many companies that provide basic living services). Therefore people derived K.S. Field from A.T. Field (Absolute Terror Field, which appears in Japanese anime EVA). Higurashi TV anime series aired its first season in Japan from July to December in 2006, and its second season on the same period in 2007. The character Rika Furude (古手 梨花)[1] and her habit of saying nonsense words such as "mii" (みぃ〜) and "nipah" (にぱ〜), among other things had often appeared on screen since the first episode.       Black Flag was founded in 1976 by guitarist and songwriter Greg Ginn. Both the band's name and logo design were conceived by Ginn's brother and bandmate Raymond Pettibon, who thought a black flag would represent anarchy as the polar opposite of the white flag typically used to signify surrender during wartime. The band featured the logo on many of their album covers and merchandise, making it one of the most iconic symbols in punk rock. One of the earliest parodies of the logo to appear online was created for the Black Flag parody band BLACK F∆G[3 ](shown below), who launched a MySpace page[4] in 2005. The band, which bills itself as an “absolutely fabulous” tribute band, uses a rainbow version of the logo to represent their LGBTQ-themed parody songs.   According to the flash maze game website Scary Maze Games, the original "Scary Maze Game"[5] (shown below) was created by developer Jeremy Winterrowd in 2003. Upon completion of the game's third level, the player is greeted by a large picture of the character Regan McNeil (played by Linda Blair) in the 1973 horror film The Exorcist.  While the identity of woman depicted in the stock photo remains unknown, the "tiger mom" persona has been linked with Amy Chua, a Yale Law School professor who wrote a column in the Wall Street Journal titled "Why Chinese Mothers are Superior"[1] in promoting her recently published Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother[2], an autobiographical essay about grade-conscious Asian moms who pressure their children to excel in academics, even at the expense of their natural interests.   The phrase is most often presented as a reaction image featuring a photograph of American conservative political activist Alan Keyes making a pointing gesture, which was taken during his service with the U.S. State Department as a diplomat under the Reagan Administration in the 1980s. The image was released into public domain by the Keyes campaign on July 31st, 2007, according to the Wikimedia Commons.[3] The exact origin date of the image macro cannot be pinpointed, but it has been around 4chan's /b/ board since at least January 20th, 2009, according to a thread on Chanarchive.[8] The term was initially popularized in the mid-to-late 1990s by American video game magazine GamePro, which used "protip" as the title of a recurring sidebar element that offers gameplay strategy tips in reviews of various video games (shown below).   The quote is a catchphrase from the character Riley Freeman, who states the catchphrase whenever something gay occurs.          High Expectations Asian Father was launched as a single topic blog[1] by friends and Tumblr users Chris[10] and Bryant[11] on March 18th, 2010. The original instance used the caption “I dun care you got A+ in English, Math, History; you got A- in art. / You fail life.” A Memegenerator watermark is present on the image, but it remains unclear when the page[2] was actually created on the site. Where did this meme come from? This meme is a parody of a user submitted review of the flash game, SUPER PSTW ACTION RPG (http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/495903). It's description is also a parody of RPG marketing hyperbole. User reviews were positive about the game, due to it's nature of badly made sprite-based 1980's Atari games and the usage of nothing but the space bar. One of the users, AXMAN13 posted a highly critical and negative review of the game. Most notably that he didn't get the gist of the parody and thought it was meant to be a serious Flash RPG. His review was also full of spelling mistakes (done out of pure emotional hate for the game) as below : Original Voice Recording: - … i reley dont wan to say this, but i have to now. this game is so esey. i mean, all you do is hit the spacebar. thats it! how is this an RPG anyway? you cant contrail anything but what it says on the screen! what if i didnt want to buy the potion? what apout quests? all you can upgrade is stranth? there is no way you can lose to the boss at the end! this game is crap! its not even an RPG at all! i mean look at it! in what way is this supposed to be an RPG if you can do quests and stuff? all you do is press one butten the entier time! explain to me! the athore coments al totol lies! is it supposed to be stick dudes? i dont even know how this damn game got the daily 3rd prize, or a rating of 4.26! pepole think this review is worthles. go ahead! say it! i dont care! im just trying to make a point here! blam this piece of crap!!!! P.S the only reson im giving this a 1 is beacuase the voices where pretty good. but thats it! The real meme is actually Dot Dot Dot, another flash posting by RicePirate (Mick Lauer) on newgrounds making fun of the AXMAN13 review. I leave you to play the game, read the review followed by the Dot Dot Dot animation. Where it is going? The original PSTW game posted 20 months ago garnered 555k hits and a rating of 4.33/5.00 on newgrounds. Dot Dot Dot, posted 12 days ago, has been seen 545k times and rated 4.69. Youtube posting 5 days ago has 150k hits. In the first part of episode 4, called “The Diet Syndrome” (Daietto Shindorōmu (ダイエット・シンドローム), Panty discovers that Stocking is on a diet, which Stocking claimed to be something she never has to go on. The main components of the videos include Panty’s over exaggerated expression as she asks about the diet, and Stocking’s horrific reaction. On October 26th, 2010, Youtube user rinlajd1a uploaded the scene gaining 180,000 views (shown below).  This icon-drawing fad began on February 19th, 2010, when DeviantArt user BakaMichi[1] posted a basic image base to create more lick icons with:  It came from the YouTuber Irdeen on one of his videos ,called Mentlegen.It was originaly the "Meet the Spy" trailer for the game Team Fortress 2 (TF2) where one of the classes, The Spy, enters a room saying "Gentlemen" (Its already a meme).Though Irdeen Remixed the part thus getting Mentlegen   The origin of this fad was created on February 22, 2006 by Stealth Beast on flash website Newgrounds. The video recreated the song The Counter-Strike Instrumental by DJ B.a.r. (a song published in 2002) in a Flash Video of Counter-Strike using stick figures. This video, although not a Machinima in itself, became the first example of the fad, a fad which gained significant popularity on Youtube.        On May 8, 2010, Youku user GoodOldArsenal uploaded a video entitled 优酷二传】搞笑漫画日和之《西游记：旅程的终点》（中文配音）（cucn201出品. Its original upload has received more than 1,500,000 views on Youku.com, although there have been multiple mirrors uploaded to other video-sharing websites, making the total viewcount difficult to determine. The video is a fandub of an episode from the Japanese anime Gag Manga Biyori. Here is a Youtube version from it, uploaded Junet 19, 2010: The anime itself consists of about parodies of short stories mainly involving Japanese mythos. The episode the meme comes from is the 10th from the first season, know as "Saiyūki: The end of the journey" (Saiyūuki: tabi no owari – 西遊記 〜旅の終わり〜) and first aired in 2005. What would strike viewers is a peculiar line in the fandub : 不给力 (Pinyin: Bù Gĕi Lì; Literally: "Not Give Power"). The original Japanese dub is shown below (with English subtitles):  An email sent to Know Your Meme suggests that the image was initially posted to the /b/ (random) board on 4chan on June 14th, 2010. "Hello there, I think it's time to straighten out some things about the LOL Guy. About MY LOL Guy. That's right, I draw this ugly piece of crap in MS Paint on the 14. June 2010 and I first posted it on /b/ in a "This is now a meme"-Thread." A few days later on June 18th, the earliest known instance of LOL Guy rage comic was submitted to the /r/f7u12[1] subreddit, featuring a customer attempting to return a fake Pokemon game cartridge to the EB Games store (shown below). Prior to being archived, the post received over 155 up votes and 30 comments.  After the song's release, several MAD creators in Japan began introducing this song to their works as same as other popular soundtracks in music video game series. One of the oldest MAD video in this series "bloomin' culting" was posted to the Japanese video sharing service Nico Nico Douga (NND) in October 21st, 2009.[3] This video featured the Japanese cult-like online phenomenon Hissu Amoto San. And several MAD videos using this song were uploaded to NND in that year. Meanwhile, "Bloomig feeling" was literally bloomed on YTPMVs in 2010 by the Japanese YTPMV creator yamas03's video "Bloomin' Octagon". As indicated by the name, this video posted to both YouTube and NND in March 23rd, 2010[4] is a derivative of Jack Black's Octagon.  In "Napoleon Dynamite", the title character helps his friend, Pedro, in his campaign for class president. When it is discovered that presidential candidates must have some sort of entertainment for the debates, Napoleon steps in and does his now-famous dance. Because of the popularity of the movie, the scene spread quickly. Several parodies and reenactments were made and posted on youtube, while parts of the dance itself became popular use as avatars.   On December 27th, 2010, Reddit user kloudera submitted a thread, entitled First Neo, now Morpheus…your move Trinity and featuring a paparazzi photograph of Laurence Fishburne on a public bench : From the watermark and a December 25 article from the PerezHilton.com website featuring the first image parody, the photograph comes from WENN. The Reddit thread has gathered more than 270 comments, along with more picture derivatives, reusing the photo as its own photoshop trend.       On January 3rd, 2011, Kevin Joy uploaded a video to YouTube showing footage of Ted Williams panhandling and responding to Joy's ostensible request for proof of his "gift of voice" by reciting various radio promotional segments. The video was re-uploaded by the YouTube account "RussiaToday", which has accumulated over 17 million views as of December 12th, 2011. The original video has since been deleted. His sign reads:          The first picture of Tubcat reportedly made its appearance in US Weekly, p. 96, on October 1, 2001. (Source: MessyBeast.com) The fan page, Tubcat.com, had its domain registered on January 9, 2002. The site, written in grammatically incorrect netspeak (Ex: "TUBCAT IZ NOT MY KITTIE!!!! I AM ONLKY A FAN!!!"), features pictures of Tubcat and his "wife," and links to tubcat-related merchandise. On the second of January 2011 an Anon made a thread with the chicken strip image with the following OP: >Gf giving me a hj >sister walks in stops for a second then leaves >girlfriend leaves after being startled. >sister comes back in and asks if she can try giving me a hj >mom walks in stops for a second then leaves >sister leaves after being startled >mom comes back in and asks if she can try giving me a hj >dad walks in >gets on the floor >then proceeded to help my mother give me a handjob. The thread was made with hopes of /b/tards posting embarrassing stories of their sex lives (which, of course, spurred many parodies). One of the first replies was as follows: >first blowjob ever >gf has never given a bj >she tries to deep throat >puke everywhere shit happened :( This humorous story was then very easy to manipulate as the following reply shows: >first blowjob ever >gf has never given a bj >she tries to deep throat >puke everywhere puke happened :( More replies soon followed as more found ways of manipulating the story. >first blowjob ever >gf has never given a bj >Forgets shes twelve >Cops bust in Rape happened :(   The quote originates from a scene where Nick and Sue come across a robber, who demands Mick's wallet, while threatening him with a small switchblade. In response, Mick laughs him off, and pulls out a machete. Robber – You got a light buddy? Mick – Yeah, sure kid. There you go. Robber – And your wallet. Sue – Mick. Give him your wallet. Mick – What for? Sue – He's got a knife. Mick – Hah hah hah. That's not a knife… Mick – THAT'S a knife. On October 21st, 2010, a post titled "And now, awkward moments with Summer Glau" was submitted to the Internet humor site Fark[1] with several pictures of the American actress posing with fans of the sci-fi television series Firefly. Fark user rcf1105 commented to the post saying, "Hover hand: sad no matter what the context. Please, let's stop hover hand. Together."       The image of the old man comes from Michelangelo's artistic rendition of the Christian God in The Creation of the Sun and Moon, one of the many paintings made between 1508 and 1512 that adorn the walls in the Sistine Chapel of the Vatican City, Italy.[1][2] According to Google custom search[11], the Advice God MemeGenerator[6] page has existed since at least August 29th, 2010. The first image submitted to MemeGenerator in the series featured the caption "Pigs? Shellfish? / Abominations."              The picture originally came from a kid's Facebook profile, who goes by the name "Evan" and sometimes "Danger". He posted the photo after he got the Kinect system for Christmas.     The earliest known definition of "FML" was submitted onto Urban Dictionary on May 13th, 2005, which was later featured as the Urban Word of the Day of March 1st, 2008: short for: Fuck My Life I just totally dropped that pass. FML guys. The single topic blog FMyLife[1] was launched on January 13th, 2009 by Maxime Valette, Guillaume Passaglia and Didier Guedj, who founded the French website Vie de merde[3], which means "life of shit," a year earlier on January 12th, 2008. VDM became an internet phenomenon in its own right, becoming the ninth-most-searched-for service on Google's French search engine, according to Wall Street Journal.[4] The Tumblr counterpart for "FMyLife" was launched on February 11th, 2011. The photograph of raccoon was originally taken by Sarah Hunt and uploaded via Flickr[1] in September 2007. The macro series in its true form didn't arrive until April 2010, when the Advice-Dog variation of "Lame Pun Raccoon" began to spread across popular hubsites like MemeGenerator[2], Quickmeme[3], Tumblr[4] and Reddit[5]. On March 4th, 2010, YouTuber doctorheredoctor posted the earliest known "Pootis" video, entitled "GOTTAMPOOTIS." The post received more than 75,000 views in less than 11 years (shown below).   The FIFA tournament's semi-final match between Congo's TP Mazembe and Brazil's Internacional took place in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates on December 14th, 2010; The tournament match resulted in the Congolese' victory with 2 – 0. Upon his team scoring the second goal, TP Mazembe's goalkeeper Kidiab busted out his signature celebration in the stadium, which was caught on screen by field cameras (skip to 2:00 mark for the goal celebration).   The first Spirit Pokemon comic was created by Tumblr user Secretcat[1] and posted to his blog on November 22nd, 2010. The comic featured a geeky boy calling upon the power of his "spirit pokemon," in this case Porygon, to help him smooth his way through an awkward social situation. As of February 2014, the Tumblr post has over 1,800 notes.   On December 17, 2010, user ichbinpwnzilla submitted The New Face of TF2 to Reddit. The post was originally intended to show how much Team Fortress 2 has changed throughout the years, with the following in-game screenshot linked to in the original post: The picture features the Team Fortress 2 character, Demoman wielding a frying pan and Chargin' Targe while wearing a pair of shutter shades and a bounty hat. In 1985, Nintendo published a video game for the NES called Super Mario Bros. The player takes on the role of the main protagonist of the series, Mario, whose objective is to race through the Mushroom Kingdom, survive the forces of the main antagonist, Bowser, and save Princess Peach Toadstool. The final stage of each world takes place in a castle where Bowser or one of his decoys are fought. When Mario defeats one of Bowser's decoys for the first time in World 1-4, Mario runs through the end with the intent of finding the kidnapped princess. However, he is greeted by a Toad, who says: This event gets repeated in every single castle in the game (except of the World 8-4 castle, which is the final stage in the game), causing anger and disappointment to the player (and possibly to the main protagonist). The phrase "go make me a sandwich" was first introduced in a Saturday Night Live skit[6] that aired on December 16th, 1995. In the skit, actor Tim Meadows appears as John-John Mackey, a weatherman who tries too hard to be hip by using confrontational language during the delivery of his forecasts. While predicting an incoming storm, he tells the storm to go make him a sandwich. The video game Half Life 2 was released by Valve on the 16th of November, 2004. As the sequel to the revolutionary Half Life, and simply because Valve made it, it immediately became wildly popular and rapidly grew a cult following. While a player progresses through the game, NPCs (Non-Playable Characters) will occasionally talk to Gordon, (the protagonist) especially if he walks into them or deliberately stares at them while the player presses the USE key. The speeches made are randomised, and occasionally a Rebel will say, "Sometimes, I Dream about Cheese." This phrase was most likely based on the following quote from Treasure Island: "Marooned three years agone," he continued, "and lived on goats since then, and berries, and oysters. Wherever a man is, says I, a man can do for himself. But, mate, my heart is sore for Christian diet. You mightn't happen to have a piece of cheese about you, now? No? Well, many's the long night I've dreamed of cheese--toasted, mostly--and woke up again, and here I were." (Quote courtesy of Peter/jpest17) The Get Out Frog first gained prominence through its appearance in a photoshoot (NSFW) starring the adult film star Next Door Nikki (shown below), which was uploaded by YouTube kurat on November 1st, 2005. Within the next eight years, the video received over 659,000 views and 460 comments. Something Awful user Chaos Ringer created a thread[6] (SA account required) on July 19th, 2009, which called for other members to help find the stuffed frog.    This meme came from a second season episode of the popular children's show SpongeBob SquarePants. The episode was No. 36a and was titled "Graveyard Shift."    On December 14th, 2010, the Daily Mail posted a photo of Jackman, taken moments before the accident. Which was shortly followed by a series of images photoshopped by the site CityRag.com in a post titled "Hugh Jackman Can Ride Anything", with an invitation to "make your own"". On January 31, 2008, Fox News syndicated an Associated Press news article titled Another Opposition Lawmaker Killed in Kenya Violence. The story was accompanied by a picture of two opposition supporters in front a burning car in Kisumu, Kenya. Click here for the uncropped version of image. In September 2009, a variant of this image with the words "Have you ever been so pissed off that you start swinging a cactus?" became popular. This picture was submitted to Imgur around that time and has over 500,000 views.     IGN[7] reported that the first posting of the original creepypasta story was on the Minecraft forums. Herobrine began as a single, foggy screenshot of a distant figure posted on the Minecraft forums. The picture was accompanied by the story of a Minecraft player finding strange, unexplained constructions in their world, apparently the sign of someone or something else being present. The earliest known thread on the Minecraft forums[8] that mentions Herobrine was posted on August 30th, 2010.  "The Mean Kitty Song" (or "Hey Little Sparta"), based on his cat with the same name, is Cory Williams' most popular video to date. It has attracted over 50 million views. In one year, it became the top 21 of YouTube's list of all-time favorite videos, top 39 of YouTube's list of all-time most discussed videos, number 1 all-time most discussed Pets & Animals video, and number 4 all-time most viewed Pets & Animals video, and is the No. 1 all-time favorite video in the Pets & Animals section. The video was also aired by CBS' The Early Show and a few other television shows as well. It was used by oldfags on 4chan who were acting like newfags. They essentially trolled other oldfags and newfags alike. In the process they claimed that "Newface" is the new Troll Face (as if troll face would be replaced.) This enraged many who bitterly defended the original Troll Face (Newface instigators referred to it as oldface), hence feeding the trolls. Many variations of this emerged during the day of 12/11/10 and the early morning of 12/12/10. Many people who are not on the 4chan website defending the "newface" think that the original troll face is better. The meme is still developing. Robert "Budd" Dwyer was the Pennsylvania State Treasurer. He was convicted on accounts of bribery in 1986, though though he consistently claimed innocence. On January 22, 1987, a day before his sentencing was to take place, Dwyer committed suicide during a press conference by shooting a revolver through his mouth.[1]  The origin of the King of GETs can be dated back to November 24th, 2007, to a thread on 4chan's /a/ board. In that thread, a user posted an image of Yami Yugi from Yu-Gi-Oh! Season 0, and commented that if his post ends with 5, Masaki Andoh's (Super Robot Wars) sister dies. The image posted, over time became most commonly associated with the King of GETs. An early example of satirical world maps can be found on the cover of March 1976 issue of The New Yorker magazine, illustrated by American cartoonist Saul Steinberg. David Horsey, a Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist, had created a similar map titled "The World According to Ronald Reagan" in 1982 for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. 'dr Tricky' says that he was not aware of David Horsey's work. The Appallingly Disrespectful Spitting Image Book also included a similar map called "The Tory Atlas of the World". www.jigsawlounge.co.uk is personal site which once belonged to three authors: Neil Young, 'dr Tricky', and Adam Maxwell. 'dr Tricky', also known as 'Flam of Thlantesa', published his humorous musings on his 'kungu fu lounge' at "www.jigsawlounge.co.uk/kungfu/index.html" [via www.archive.org]. In 1997 or 1998, 'dr Tricky' made a satirical map of the world titled "The World According to America" using an Amiga 1200 and Deluxe Paint III. On February 1, 2003, 'dr Tricky' wrote an article detailing the history of his image [via www.archive.org]. He created four other "The World according to X" images and published them here [via www.archive.org]. 'dr Tricky' hasn't updated his webpage since June 29, 2004. On October 5, 2007, his 'kung fu lounge' was removed. 'Mapping Stereotypes' is a project by Yanko Tsvetkov to map the world according to the "geography of prejudice". His work can be found here. Jesusland is a fictional country made up of "red" states, or states that traditionally vote Republican. The meme surfaced in 2004 during the U.S. presidential election season, when a satirical map of the new country, along with its counterpart “The United States of Canada” (consisting of blue states and Canada), was uploaded to YakYak.org. For more info & examples, please refer to KYMdb – Jesusland.            The character “Neko-Pan” (猫パン) was first introduced through the Japanese children's book Catbread and Cardboard Box (猫パン　と　だんぼーる君)[8], written and illustrated by author Hirose Takuro[1] and self-published via his webpage in 2000. According to Takuro[9], the book was originally made using a web application by the printer corporation Hewlett-Packard. In the following years, Takuro continued to showcase various icon files and illustrative artworks based on the character.[24][25]  The catchphrases originate from page 18 of Hiroyuki's hentai doujin, Platonic Magician H [1] based off the popular visual novel Fate/stay night. It is the same series famous for People Die If They Are Killed, MOU IKKAI, Gar, and Unlimited Blade Works. In it, Shirou Emiya is asked to replenish his servant's (Saber's) magic, but Shirou is apparently clueless about sex, and needs Saber and Rin Tōsaka to help him out. You Lost Me comes from the first panel of one of veloxiraptor's comics[2] about Fate/stay night.  One of the earliest image macros featuring the tagline can be found on a MyConfinedSpace[1] blog post uploaded by user TikiGod on February 27th, 2008. The image depicts one of the Gargoyle sculpture ornaments found on the facade of Magdelen College building at Oxford University, United Kingdom:  The video was first published in the August/September edition of the Music Express Magazine. The dance is choreographed for the song "Planet Rock", which was written by John Jacobson as well.    On January 28th, 2009, YouTuber komikero posted the video. Within 11 years, the video received more than 6.6 million views (shown below).    On October 12th, 2001, Japanese video game developers Capcom released Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney, a game in which you play as a defense attorney, in Japan on the Nintendo Game Boy Advance. On October 12th, 2005, the game released in North America on the Nintendo DS. The game was generally well-received, resulting in a number of sequels, an anime and manga adaptation, while also helping to popularize visual novels outside of Japan. During the courtroom segments of the game, the player can shout "Objection!" if they want to present evidence in objection to what is being presented by the witness or prosecutor. When the player objects, Phoenix Wright shouts the word, stylized in bold-red text art surrounded by an action bubble, and points forward (shown below). Other characters in the courtroom scenes, including the prosecutors, are also known to do this. The point, shout and stylized "Objection!" appear in all Phoenix Wright games, becoming the most iconic image from the series over the next two decades (examples shown below).       The oldest instance which features the similarity of 2 main characters in each manga/light novel, Ika Musume and Index, was an illustration posted to the Japanese illustrators community pixiv on January 16th, 2009.[1] However, another illustration by pixiv user Kanikama (かにかま) is known as the actual origin of this crossover fandom. It was posted on May 23rd 2010 (shown below, left). Then, this fandom arose along with the beginning of both TV animes, the 1st season of Squid Girl and the 2nd season of A Certain Magical Index in October 2010. One of the earliest instances in those days was a parody video swapping each other's voices which was posted to NND on 6th of that month (shown below, right). The impression to their similarity among viewers became to be reinforced by parody videos remixing visual/vocal resources taken from the animes like this.      The movie "Law Abiding Citizen" is a crime thriller starring Gerard Butler, Jamie Foxx, and Leslie Bibb, and was released on October 16, 2009. It is about a man who loses his wife and daughter to two criminals. He then becomes a sociopath, warring against the "corrupt" justice system.         The song "Sweet Child o' Mine" was originally written and recorded by American rock band Guns N' Roses and released as the third single from their 1987 debut studio album Appetite for Destruction. Upon its single release in August 1988, the song topped the Billboard Hot 100 and became one of the band's most commercially successful songs.[1] The comedy film Step Brothers, starring Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly, was released on July 25, 2008.[2] A scene in the film features the character Derek Huff (played by Adam Scott) and his family singing an acapella version of "Sweet Child o' Mine" during a car ride. The scene was uploaded to YouTube by user inkme1983 on October 25, 2008, and has since been viewed over 10,000,000 times as of June 2014.[3]  Jakob Lodwick, the founder of Vimeo, coined the term "lip dubbing" on December 14, 2006, in a video entitled Lip Dubbing: Endless Dream. In the video's description, he wrote, "I walked around with a song playing in my headphones, and recorded myself singing. When I got home I opened it in iMovie and added an MP3 of the actual song, and synchronized it with my video. Is there a name for this? If not, I suggest 'lip dubbing'." Lodwick also directed the Flagpole Sitta 'office lip dub' in April 2007, often considered the first viral instance of lib dub phenomenon on the web.          On November 13th 2010 John Tyner, a blogger from California, secretly filmed himself going through security at San Diego International Airport. When Tyner refused to walk through a full body scanner a TSA agent told him they would need to pat him down, to which he replied: Two hours later he posted an account of his experience (which can be read in full here) onto his blog jonnyedge.blogspot.com.  In the 12th November 2010, a man called Emílio Eduardo da Rocha Devesa, from Cerro Azul, Brazil, "murdered his own mother" after he discovered that she used his credit card without his permission. On November 19th, he was arrested and charged for the crime. His family confessed to the police that he was addicted to crack and cocaine and had several mental disorders. On the same day, the story aired in Boa Tarde Paraná, a regional newscaster. It included a short and… failed interview with Emílio. On October 15th, 2009, during a regular meeting of Saeima, Līdaka climbed on the tribune to comment on the proposed reduction of days when you have to hoist a Latvian flag on your house. Although he seemed calm, if a bit tense at start, he soon became angry when he mentioned that he heard the "left wing" talking about removing 11th (Lāčplēsis Day, meant to honour the fallen soldiers in the Independence War of 1918--1919) and 18th November (Latvian Independence Day) out of the calendar of holidays. While explaining that the Independence Day is a holiday in all countries, he heard the "left wing" (Harmony Centre and ForHRUL) politicians talking and shouted "Aizver muti!" (Shut your mouth!) mid-sentence. Although these politicians protested loudly, Līdaka carried on to finish his speech, also managing to call them the "left wing zoo of animals and birds" which is ironic as Līdaka himself works in a zoo. The Deputy Speaker, Solvita Āboltiņa, decided not to warn him of talking to the audience until the speech was over. (Transcript from 0:44 until 0:49) I. Līdaka: In every country the independence day is a holiday… SHUT YOUR MOUTH!  The phrase "Your Music's Bad and You Should Feel Bad" was first uttered in the Futurama episode titled "The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,"[5] which first aired on August 10th, 2003. After Fry trades hands with the Robot Devil, he performs an opera in effort to woo Leela. In the middle of the performance, the Robot Devil returns and demands his hands back from Fry, or else the Devil would marry Leela himself. Fry agrees, and continues the performance, who is now significantly less skilled at playing the holophoner. As Fry is playing poorly, Zoidberg criticizes his music from the crowd. Don Ramon is a character of Mexican sitcom El Chavo del Ocho, a popular show in Latin America produced by Roberto Gomez Bolaños (who also plays as the main character, "El chavo") Don Ramon character is played by Ramon Valdes, one of the 3 Valdes Brothers. Ramon Valdes, even though being featured in major films next to his brother German Valdes (a major legend on Mexican Folclore, better known as "Tin-Tan") never got to shine in the same way, since he always took small TV roles for living (Ironically, pretty much as his TV counterpart). Don Ramon's character is always pictured with a black t-shirt, a pair of jeans, white tennis and a very characteristic blue demin hat.    While he configuration of QWERTY keyboard layout varies across different language zones, an exclamation point is almost always invoked by holding down the shift key and pressing the digit / symbol key (1/!). As a result, the erroneous input of "1" after a string of exclamation points became a common typo in online chat, especially when typing in haste. The typo gradually became associated with leetspeak in the late 1990s with the introduction of real-time online multiplayer games where punctual grammar leaves the gamer vulnerable to attack from the opponents, according to the academic research paper "Game Geek’s Goss: Linguistic Creativity In Young Males Within An Online University Forum"[4] by the Australian new media scholar Katherine Blashki in November 2005. During the weeks after the September 11th, 2001 attacks, many conspiracy theories and conjectures regarding the identity of the perpetrators began flooding online discussion forums across the United States and overseas, which were fueled by the absence of a comprehensive official account of the events from the George W. Bush administration, as well as publication of news reports based on incomplete information and less-than-reliable sources in the media. One of the first reading materials that summarized the leading conspiracy theories in circulation was published on February 1st, 2002 by the conspiracy theorists' website WhatReallyHappened[4] in an article titled "The 9/11 Hijackings – An Inside Job?    "Ah, Yes, Reapers" originates from a scene in Mass Effect 2, where Commander Shepard is speaking to the council. After Shepard brings up the Reapers, the main antagonist of the series, one of the council members dismisses the idea by saying: "Ah, yes, 'Reapers'. The immortal race of sentient starships allegedly waiting in dark space. We have dismissed this claim." What makes the line especially noticeable are the air quotes the council member uses around "Reapers". That, combined with the general reaction of the council member, caused the whole ordeal to be seen as hilarious by the gaming community.  On April 23rd, 2010, user bobotech posted a story and video to a car enthusiast forum suggesting that the van was his: The song's music is based on 2 soundtracks in Touhou series : Tewi Inaba's theme from the 9th Touhou game Phantasmagoria of Flower, titled "White Flag of Usa Shrine", which was released at August 14th, 2005[2] and Stage 5 theme from the 8th Touhou game Imperishable Night, titled "Cinderella Cage ~ Kagome-Kagome", which was released at August 14th, 2004.[3] Usatei was first released on the Touhou remix album Touhou Suisuisuusuu (Touhou Gathering Green Wine Drunkenness), released by IOSYS on August 17th, 2007 at the popular comic book convention Comiket. This song begins with two guys that are about two begin a 2-player match in the touhou game Phantasmagoria of Flower View, and one of them, Beat Mario the singer and creator of many popular Touhou remixes, is boasting about his skill and tells his friend to pick Cirno as character with a specific creepy speech of Otaku. Instead, both of them picks the character Tewi Inaba, which is considered to be a rather annoying opponent due to her special attacks. IOSYS launched the special page for this album and released this promoting flash animation on August 1st, 2007.[4] This flash animation was made by Kagi, also famous as the creator of other popular promoting videos for Touhou remixes : Cirno’s perfect Math class, Marisa Stole the Precious Thing and Overdrive. The feature of this flash animation is that its visual effect is changed depending on repeating counts (3rd, 5th, 9th, 15th, 24th, 33rd, 42nd, 54th, 66th, 80th, 98th, 99th and 100th). In addition, the author said the effect of shower of words ("てゐ", "うさ", "( ・ｘ・）") got inspiration from the "bullet curtain" comments on NND where Touhou remixes by IOSYS were getting huge popularity on.[5] This video reuploaded to NND by a user has been got over 2 million veiws.[6]   On July 18th, 2003, the movie Bad Boys 2[1] released in North America. In one scene, Martin Lawrence's character gets an important phone call that escalates the level of danger he and his partner are in. After he hangs up the phone, Lawrence says, "Shit just got real." On December 17th, 2010, YouTuber[2] golivebutton uploaded the clip to YouTube, garnering over 519,000 views in 10 years (shown below). On February 14th, 2007, the movie Hot Fuzz[3] released in North America, also including the phrase.[4] This helped boost its popularity, evidenced by a boost in search interest later that year as people began using the phrase online. On May 8th, 2007, for example, John Wiseman of Lemonodor made a post titled "Shit Just Got Real" about a fire breaking out in Los Feliz (shown below).   Though the original version was removed by the uploader from YouTube, many people have reuploaded the full version back onto YouTube. Since it has been deleated, original stats on the video have been lost. However, the cut version (At the top of the page) has recieved nearly 17,000,000 views to date.         The earliest known facebombs coincided with the emergence of the Weegee photoshop meme on 4chan in 2007, in which the face of the Super Mario video game franchise character Luigi from the 1992 educational game Mario is Missing is superimposed on to various subjects within an image (shown below). "Challenge accepted" began as a catchphrase for the character Barney Stinson in the television sitcom How I Met Your Mother. The earliest instance of Stinson uttering the phrase can be heard in Season 2, Episode 6 “Aldrin Justice” while announcing his intention to seduce an older woman. The episode originally aired on October 23rd, 2006. [after Marshal infers his professor is tough on her grades because she needs to get laid] Barney Stinson: Marshall, I've thought it over and I accept your challenge. Marshall Eriksen: I didn't challenge you to have sex with… Barney Stinson: Tomorrow, the cougar hunt begins. The earliest known instances of the the rage comic character were posted in a thread by Body Building[3] Forums member MK on November 12th, 2010, which included two challenge accepted examples (shown below).   On November 17th, 2010, American retail chain Hot Topic introduced a new t-shirt design featuring Rage Guy, a stick figure character from the popular internet cartoons that had its beginning on 4chan in late 2008. The online phenomenon of illustrating and sharing self-portraits have been in existence prior to the emergence of "Draw Yourself" template, with notable examples like "Draw Yourself as a South Park Character" and "Draw Yourself as a Teenager" from the early 2000s. The stick-figure template was created by LaxJeff2002 on a F@NBOY$ Forum [1] thread. The figure itself first appeared on the /co/ board of 4chan after having been posted there by a friend of Jeff's, where over 250 images of it were made. Privilege Denying Dude (PDD for short) series was created by Diane, a 20 year old blogger from South Carolina who launched the official PDD Tumblr site in early November. According to an interview with Jezebel, Diane bought the license of a stock photograph (shown above) at iStockPhoto and created the template, which eventually spread over to Memegenerator.net and reached the top tier.    The fad Dat Alarm Clock, started by Youtube user TheToenninga, was originated from the television show Family Guy on a part. A clip uploaded on YouTube showed one of the main characters, Peter Griffin, directly stating that the radio sitting on the table was worthless and compares it to the "Palestinian alarm clock", scene transition, where it cuts to Peter and Louise sleeping in bed when their "Palestinian" alarm clock goes off to 7:00, causing the device to scream "Allahu Akbar" before violently exploding their house. The clip gained thousands of views and remixes were created, but the video credits to TheToenninga.   This meme was created by the members of 4chan, specifically /b/. The date of creation is questionable, but it seems to be around may of 2010. "Big Lipped Alligator Moment" was first mentioned in the Nostalgia Critic's duo review of the movie FernGully: The Last Rainforest with the Nostalgia Chick. During the review they came across the below musical number, and the Chick coined the title, referring to the 1989 film All Dogs Go to Heaven.  The Zaza phenomenon began on April 5, 2006 when user MrApgar created a YTMND site titled Zaza, featuring GIF animation of Black Ranger Zack Taylor demonstrating his breakdance-influenced martial arts on the opening entrance of "the Hatch" from the TV series LOST. This site, combined with the "Za-za-za-za-za" audio sample heard at 3:11 in LL Cool J’s song "Control Myself", sparked the interest in "zaza" phenomenon, eventually giving it over 290,000 views. The "za-za-za-za-za" heard in LL Cool J's song was originally sampled from the 1982 hip hop song Planet Rock by Afrika Bambaataa. The audio sample first made its way over to YTMND with a popular instance of Dew Army series titled "My Chainsaw" in March 2006 (now-defunct).     Outside of the Internet, one early reference to being "jelly," as in "jealous," can be found in the 1999 Beatnuts single "Watch Out Now"[1]. The phrase initially gained traction via 4chan[2] imageboards and subsequently spread throughout other discussion forums and hubsites.  The project was founded by columnist Dan Savage in response to the suicides of Billy Lucas and other teenagers like Raymond Chase, Tyler Clementi, Ryan Halligan, Asher Brown, and Seth Walsh who were bullied for their homosexual orientation or suspected to be gay. The project was formally announced on September 21st, 2010 in a YouTube[1] video titled "It Gets Better: Dan and Terry" featuring Savage himself and his partner Terry Miller. In the video, Savage and Miller reaches out to teenagers who have ever been bullied for their sexual orientation and tell them that although life may seem difficult now, things will get better in the future as they grow older. The video was positively received within the YouTube community, accumulating one million views and over 200 video responses the first week of the campaign. The character of Castiel (played by Misha Collins) was introduced in the first episode of the show’s fourth season, titled “Lazarus Rising” which originally aired on September 18th, 2008. The members of the fan community almost immediately began shipping Castiel, often shortened as Cas, with Dean (played by Jensen Ackles) through a LiveJournal blog titled “DeanCastiel”[2] dedicated to Dean/Cas slash fiction created the same day. One of the first mentions of the portmanteau is in the title of the Destiel LiveJournal[7], which was created on September 26th, 2008. The original cover image of Abbey Road was shot by photographer Iain Macmillian on August 8, 1969 outside EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London, England, and was released as the cover of The Beatles' 11th studio album on September 26, 1969.[1] The album has been considered to be one of the greatest in their career, and one of the best in rock history, reaching #14 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.[2] Parodies of Abbey Road predate the Internet in popular culture. One of the earliest known parodies of the album was the release of McLenore Avenue by Booker T. & The M.G.'s in April 1970, featuring the members walking across the street outside Stax Studio in Memphis, Tennessee.[3] The album payed tribute to the Beatles, consisting of instrumental covers of Abbey Road.          The original strip that inspired the meme can be found in the issue #1422 of web comic series Cyanide & Happiness posted by Rob on October 6, 2008. The comic begins with a scuffle between two characters and as others jump in to break it up, one of them yells "Conga!" and the scrimmage suddenly turns into a Conga line, a style of Cuban carnival march that's become a staple party thing in the US since the 1930s. On the very next day, Explosm artist Dave McElfatrick posted another comic strip featuring the "Conga!" joke. On October 19th, 2008, Rob posted a follow-up iteration featuring his joke:     Dammit Jim, I'm a Doctor not a X is a meme which originated from Star Trek: The Original Series . The phase was originally said by Dr Leonard McCoy but is also said by many other characters not just restricted to The Original Series The copypasta story is said to have originated from thisman.org[1], a website launched in September 2009 by Italian viral marketing specialist Andrea Natella. According to the site description, the portrait (shown below) was drawn by a mental patient of a well-known psychiatrist: In January 2006 in New York, the patient of a well-known psychiatrist draws the face of a man that has been repeatedly appearing in her dreams. In more than one occasion that man has given her advice on her private life. The woman swears she has never met the man in her life. That portrait lies forgotten on the psychiatrist’s desk for a few days until one day another patient recognizes that face and says that the man has often visited him in his dreams. He also claims he has never seen that man in his waking life. The psychiatrist decides to send the portrait to some of his colleagues that have patients with recurrent dreams. Within a few months, four patients recognize the man as a frequent presence in their own dreams. All the patients refer to him as THIS MAN. The website also insists that since January 2006, at least 2,000 people from all over the world have claimed they have seen "This Man" in their dreams, with reports coming from Los Angeles, Berlin, Sao Paulo, Tehran, Beijing, Rome, Barcelona, Stockholm, Paris, New Delhi, Moscow, etc.          Creed's Tactical Genius is a meme that revolves around a special rule of one Imperial Guard character from Warhammer 40,000, Lord Castellan Usarkar E. Creed, that allows him to give any unit the Scouts rules. This rule allows units to either A) get a head-start on their movement (moving before anybody else moves, even allowing two movements if you get to move first) or B) use the Outflank special rule.   This song is an opening theme song for the 1st season of the TV anime series aired from October to December in 2010. In addition to the cuteness of this song, it got an attention among anime otakus from another point of view soon after the anime began to be aired because its lyrics, based on Japanese traditional "Dempa Song" style, was able to be read as a story of participator of Comic Market[2] at Tokyo Big Sight[3] and also included many jargon terms among Doujin comic circles. This topic was covered by several weblogs[4][5] and internet news sites.[6][7] The Creeper was first released in the August 31, 2009 Survival Test update[7]. They are the only mob to drop Music Discs as well as being the easiest source of gunpowder in the game, which is necessary to craft TNT. However, when a creeper comes within one block of a player, the user has 1.5 seconds to either move 3-4 blocks away or kill the monster before it explodes [1]. According to the points system used by the 3rd stage of Minecraft development, Survival Test, Creepers are the most valuable mob at 200 points, while the next closest mob is worth 120 points[2]. Creepers are also the only offensive creature in the game that can be out in sunlight. Spiders become neutral during the day and both zombies and skeletons burn and die once the sun comes up. When struck by lightning, Creepers become Charged and are 5 times as powerful as normal. Players will often lure creepers into a box in which they cannot escape. In Survival Multiplayer Mode (SMP), it is common for players to lead the Creepers to an enemy’s house and allow the Creeper to explode, destroying that player’s base. This practice is commonly referred to as creeping, griefing, or leading. Beginning in the Minecraft forums, the hissing sound made by Creepers before exploding became an interruptor, where people would type out ‘’ssssSS!’’ in conversation to derail a conversation. While the exact origin is unknown, one of the earliest posts of the Creeper sound used in this manner dates back to April 11th 2010.[6]  On October the 28th 2010, Paparazzi photos (taken by the Bauer Griffin agency) featuring Keanu Reeves started being hosted on Zimbio.com. Entilted Keanu Reeves Shadowboxes, it's a series of fourteen photos showing Keanu passing by some buildings, parking his car and then going in a shady area to do some shadowboxing exercises.  While the idea of "I can see forever" was perhaps inspired by the central message of H.P. Lovecraft's "The Call of Cthulhu," the phrase itself does not appear in the story. It seems that many on the internet conflated this quote with H.P. Lovecraft because of a picture of a photoshopped Family Circus.    The word "Dakka" originated from the tabletop wargame Warhammer 40,000. One of the army factions in the game, the Orks, are well-known for their obsession with automatic firearms (even if they don't aim, shown by them having a rather poor Ballistic Skill of 2, where as a normal human has one of 3), to the point where it is within their culture that the faster your gun fires, the better. This is represented by their guns being Assault 2 rather than Rapid Fire (the difference being that with Assault 2, you can always fire two bullets no matter how far you move. Rapid Fire fires two rounds up to half range, and one round if you didn't move at all, but only past half-range. However, again to simulate Ork inaccuracy, the Shoota has a shorter range of 18", where as a "lasgun", which is as close to a "normal" gun as you can get in the setting has a range of 24"). It is also an upgrade available for Flash Gitz (the most wealthy Orks, typically decked out in a bunch of gaudy jewlery with the most expensive guns, called "snazzguns". The More Dakka upgrade makes it Assault 2 rather than Assault 1) Kasou Taishou (欽ちゃん＆香取慎吾の全日本仮装大賞) is a semi-annual amateur talent show organized by NTV, featuring a rotation of about 30 skits performed by amateur individuals and groups. At the end of each skit, a panel of 10 judges vote on how much they liked it, with a passing score at 15 above and maximum score at 20. On March 30, 2003, the 28th contestant group led by team captain Hideki Kajiwara (梶原比出樹) won the competition with a highly creative skit combining a game of ping pong and physics-defying moves in the style of The Matrix. While the scene begins like a normal round of ping pong, the complexity of choreography intensifies throughout the skit with a series of stage-hand assisted, otherwise impossible movements. John West Commercial's or "Man vs. Bear" are short commercials advertising John West Salmon. In every commercial he has to fight a bear or other animal to catch the best of the best fish. The catchy slogan "John West endures the worst to bring you the best." proves that.         On October 20, 2010, CAGW, or Citizens Against Government Waste, uploaded a an advertisement to their youtube page after several television networks refused to show it. The original video shows a Chinese professor in the future lecturing students about the mistakes that America had made. The way the Chinese were depicted in the video sparked a reaction from viewers, some speaking out against the racism of the video others supporting the video. However, two days later, parody videos were being made, changing the subtitles in a similar nature to the Hitler Downfall Meme. Some people have even changed the subtitles and imagse shown in order to change the ad so that it attacks Republicans.      Scene wolf images combine the face of Insanity Wolf with "scene" hair. While there are two images representing Scene Wolf on Memegenerator[1], the most macros use the following template: On March 20th, 2007, the phrase "Chill Your Tits" was submitted to Urban Dictionary by user Gage Magz.[1]  Professor Oak's character was introduced in the very first games, Pokemon Red & Blue for the GameBoy, released in Japan in 1996 and introduced to the Western world in 1998. A Pokemon researcher who is widely considered to be the best in his field, Oak is a source of much info and help throughout both the games and the spin-off anime series. Interestingly, he is also the grandfather of the equally memetic Gary Oak. Although the exact first example of Professor Oak appearing in the Advice Animals format is unknown, the earliest post found online traces back to December 7th, 2010, when user St2udent shared two variants to the Penro forum on Forumotion[1] under a thread titled "Pokememes: Gotta spam 'em all!" (shown below). This is also the earliest-known instance of the meme being coined "Advice Oak." Written sometime in 2009 by webcartoonist Kris Straub[6], the story is presented in the format of a message board conversation among numerous participants, who manage to piece together their memories of a children's TV show about a young girl named Janice and her imaginary band of pirates with dark personalities. As the dialogue progresses, a handful of posters come to the eerie realization that they have had the same nightmares from watching the show, only to be eclipsed by an even more shocking revelation from the final poster asserting that the show actually consists of 30 minutes of static and nothing more. The story was uploaded to the horror fiction site Ichior Falls[2] on March 15th, 2009 under a Creative Commons license. Jaren_2005 Subject: Re: Candle Cove local kid’s show? Sorry to ressurect this old thread but I know exactly what show you mean, Skyshale. I think Candle Cove ran for only a couple months in ‘71, not ‘72. I was 12 and I watched it a few times with my brother. It was channel 58, whatever station that was. My mom would let me switch to it after the news. Let me see what I remember. It took place in Candle cove, and it was about a little girl who imagined herself to be friends with pirates. The pirate ship was called the Laughingstock, and Pirate Percy wasn’t a very good pirate because he got scared too easily. And there was calliope music constantly playing. Don’t remember the girl’s name. Janice or Jade or something. Think it was Janice. Skyshale033 Subject: Re: Candle Cove local kid’s show? Thank you Jaren!!! Memories flooded back when you mentioned the Laughingstock and channel 58. I remember the bow of the ship was a wooden smiling face, with the lower jaw submerged. It looked like it was swallowing the sea and it had that awful Ed Wynn voice and laugh. I especially remember how jarring it was when they switched from the wooden/plastic model, to the foam puppet version of the head that talked. mike_painter65 Subject: Re: Candle Cove local kid’s show? ha ha i remember now too. do you remember this part skyshale: “you have…to go…INSIDE.” Skyshale033 Subject: Re: Candle Cove local kid’s show? Ugh mike, I got a chill reading that. Yes I remember. That’s what the ship always told Percy when there was a spooky place he had to go in, like a cave or a dark room where the treasure was. And the camera would push in on Laughingstock’s face with each pause. YOU HAVE… TO GO… INSIDE. With his two eyes askew and that flopping foam jaw and the fishing line that opened and closed it. Ugh. It just looked so cheap and awful. You guys remember the villain? He had a face that was just a handlebar mustache above really tall, narrow teeth. kevin_hart Subject: Re: Candle Cove local kid’s show? i honestly, honestly thought the villain was pirate percy. i was about 5 when this show was on. nightmare fuel. Jaren_2005 Subject: Re: Candle Cove local kid’s show? That wasn’t the villain, the puppet with the mustache. That was the villain’s sidekick, Horace Horrible. He had a monocle too, but it was on top of the mustache. I used to think that meant he had only one eye. But yeah, the villain was another marionette. The Skin-Taker. I can’t believe what they let us watch back then. kevin_hart Subject: Re: Candle Cove local kid’s show? jesus h. christ, the skin taker. what kind of a kids show were we watching? i seriously could not look at the screen when the skin taker showed up. he just descended out of nowhere on his strings, just a dirty skeleton wearing that brown top hat and cape. and his glass eyes that were too big for his skull. christ almighty. Skyshale033 Subject: Re: Candle Cove local kid’s show? Wasn’t his top hat and cloak all sewn up crazily? Was that supposed to be children’s skin?? mike_painter65 Subject: Re: Candle Cove local kid’s show? yeah i think so. rememer his mouth didn’t open and close, his jaw just slid back and foth. i remember the little girl said “why does your mouth move like that” and the skin-taker didn’t look at the girl but at the camera and said “TO GRIND YOUR SKIN” Skyshale033 Subject: Re: Candle Cove local kid’s show? I’m so relieved that other people remember this terrible show! I used to have this awful memory, a bad dream I had where the opening jingle ended, the show faded in from black, and all the characters were there, but the camera was just cutting to each of their faces, and they were just screaming, and the puppets and marionettes were flailing spastically, and just all screaming, screaming. The girl was just moaning and crying like she had been through hours of this. I woke up many times from that nightmare. I used to wet the bed when I had it. kevin_hart Subject: Re: Candle Cove local kid’s show? i don’t think that was a dream. i remember that. i remember that was an episode. Skyshale033 Subject: Re: Candle Cove local kid’s show? No no no, not possible. There was no plot or anything, I mean literally just standing in place crying and screaming for the whole show. kevin_hart Subject: Re: Candle Cove local kid’s show? maybe i’m manufacturing the memory because you said that, but i swear to god i remember seeing what you described. they just screamed. Jaren_2005 Subject: Re: Candle Cove local kid’s show? Oh God. Yes. The little girl, Janice, I remember seeing her shake. And the Skin-Taker screaming through his gnashing teeth, his jaw careening so wildly I thought it would come off its wire hinges. I turned it off and it was the last time I watched. I ran to tell my brother and we didn’t have the courage to turn it back on. mike_painter65 Subject: Re: Candle Cove local kid’s show? i visited my mom today at the nursing home. i asked her about when i was littel in the early 70s, when i was 8 or 9 and if she remebered a kid’s show, candle cove. she said she was suprised i could remember that and i asked why, and she said “because i used to think it was so strange that you said ‘i’m gona go watch candle cove now mom’ and then you would tune the tv to static and juts watch dead air for 30 minutes. you had a big imagination with your little pirate show.” The sudden trend in waffle/carrot discussion was a ploy to confuse Reddit users who had been attending that afternoon's Rally To Restore Sanity in Washington into thinking a new meme had been created while they were distracted. The original post (which can be viewed here) said: Though other ideas were thrown into the mix, such as adding "robo-" to the beginning of words and typing comments in Spanish, the original idea turned out to be favored more so than the rest, and caught on quickly.         The original comic was illustrated by an anonymous artist who goes by the handle Psudonym,[6] which depicts a stick figure who is subsequently illustrated with more detail as a woman with a diploma before saying "thanks Dad" to her creator. According to an interview with artist, the first version of the comic was created in a 4chan thread when he was challenged to illustrate a comic entirely in MS Paint (shown below).[5] The earliest known posting of the redrawn version of the comic was submitted to a 4chan[1] thread on February 28th, 2009 (shown below).    On March 4, 2006, a site titled punch the keys, for god's sake was submitted by user Aphex350, a YTMND version of the original Finding Forrester scene that inspired the Max Goldberg to create the original "You're the man now dog" site. The original scene on YouTube: William Forrest: Punch the keys for god's sake! Jamal Wallace: (typing) William Forrest: YES! Jamal Wallace: (typing) William Forrest: YEES! William Forrest: You're the man now, dog! Within the same day, user RySenkari created the original PTKFGS site, entitling it "What Could Have Been…" and parodying the You're the man now dog site. On March 8, 2006, the site safety not guaranteed changes internet history! was created by Humphro, which according to YTMND Wiki is often credited with boosting the fads popularity, and creating the idea of the alternate PTKFGS universe. In it, the Time Traveller goes back in time after watching the scene that inspired the creation of YTMND, and creates PTKFGS.com (See also: Safety not Guaranteed). The site now has over 111,000 views. However, searching by date indicates that on March 5, 2006, an earlier spin-off appeared called WWW.PTKFGS.COM, made by user RuBBa-cHiKiN, showing what a potential PTKFGS website could have looked like.   While the origin of the concept is scarcely documented, two New Jersey teenagers John Elmo and Jim Davidson began making a series of prank phone calls to the local bar Tube Bar in the mid-1970s, asking the bartender if they could speak to various gag-named customers like "Al Coholic" (as in an alcoholic), "Ben Dover" (as in "bend over) or "Cole Kutz" (as in cold cuts). Over the coming years, recordings of the prank calls eventually began to circulate on bootleg tapes and it was dubbed the nickname "Tube Bar tapes."[1] The trope has been since used frequently on the animated TV series The Simpsons, in which the bar owner Moe Szyslak[2] often gets prank-called by the main character Bart Simpson.   In the television series, Dad often shows his resentment toward his neighbour Dinkleberg by muttering his name in a scowling tone. A screen captured image often used in image macros comes from Season 3, Episode 22 titled "Miss Dimmsdale" (shown below). One of the earliest known postings online was in a 4chan thread created on November 24th, 2010, featuring pictures of several animated television characters (shown below).   As a personification, Anonymous was created on 4chan sometime before 2006. An early appearance of Anonymous is in the flash movie Sageman [1], where Anonymous is shown fighting Sage man. Another flash movie also includes Anonymous, and was uploaded to Newgrounds on January 21 2006 [2]. The appearance of Anonymous is believed to have been inspired by The Son of Man, a painting by René Magritte. The green color of Anonymous' skin may have been based off the green apple covering most of the man's face. [citation needed]  One of the earliest known discussions of the toilet paper orientation was published in Barry Sinrod and Mel Poretz’s 1989 book The First Really Important Survey of American Habits,[1] in which the author asserts that 68% of the surveyed Americans preferred to have their toilet paper hang over the top of the roll. One of the earliest online discussions can be traced back to June 1997, when a Purdue University student known as "Nads" created a personal homepage[12] (shown below) with a poll allowing people to share their opinions.   On March 4, 2006, a YTMND was submitted of the scene in Finding Forrester which not only included the phrase "You're the man now dog," but also "Punch the keys for God's sake." Within hours, the YTMND What Could Have Been… was made. This is considered to be the first official PTKFGS and the start of the Alternate YTMND universes.  Jimmy McMillan represented The Rent Is Too Damn High Party at the New York Gubernatorial debate on October 18th, 2010. During the course of the debate, McMillan could be heard repeating his slogan several times. The same day, McMillan's debate speech was uploaded to YouTube by news website The Daily Beast[15], which accumulated over 7.2 million views and 21,000 comments within two years. "I represent 'The Rent Is Too Damn High Party.' People are working 8 hours a day and 40 hours a week and some a third job. Women can't afford to take care of their children, feed their children breakfast, lunch and dinner. My main job is to provide a roof over your head, food on the table and money in your pocket. This is politics as usual, playing the silly game, and this is not gonna happen." It is unknown exactly what movie or show this is from or if it even originated from TV but it is widely used it shows and movies as part of a phrase. Luis Pinto is a self-proclaimed fashion model, Mister Chile runner-up that has become a viral meme in Chile due to his ridiculous antics, delusional statements and specially for this particular video, where he greets his "international fans" in English (well, what he thinks English is). His English is so bad and his self assurance so big that turns him into an epic-fail-gone-cult kind of internet celebrity. Here are some videos of him uploaded on youtube, starting with his now classic greeting to his fans in his own bizarre English dialect. As of 2008, he starred a FIAT ad that hasn't been aired, but it seems it is genuine and it was produced by an advertising agency in Chile. He didn't need to act just to be himself.        On December 24th, 2005, MilitaryPhotos.net user "Sergey31" created a thread entitled "Rocket Propelled Chainsaw in Action"[2] in which he presented a comic strip based on an idea by someone named "Mr. Skorotsnoy." The first panel of the comic showed a diagram representing a side view of a new concept of weaponry: The Rocket Propelled Chainsaw, labeled RPC M1B. The rest of the comic depicted its usage in a warzone, "Somewhere in Chechnya," supposedly against the Talibans. From that comic, two panels showing the schematics of the weapon and the travel of the chainsaw projectile gained recognition. The 23/04/2002, a user called Top Cat posted on the "off topic" forum of the game company Paradox a story about a casual acquaintance of his vainly boasting over his knowledge of streetfight. The story included the notion that, in respect to martial arts, using weapons during a fight would put someone at an "immediate disadvantage". The story also mentionned "the Octagon", referring to the caged enclosure used for Ultimate Fighting Championship, which became the name by which the meme was known. Original post here. The story became quickly popular among the users of Paradox OT forum and was still widely referred to until at least 2008/2009. It occasionnally appears here and there on the internet, although always more or less in relation to its original forum – making it at best a persistent but local meme. The first use of this phrase is believed to be from the popular show Furturama in the episode When Aliens Attack on November 7, 1999. However, the actual meme did not begin until much later and it is unknown to what caused its sudden popularity in the mid 2000's. The first known Urban Dictionary was by Jesus H. Christ on January 20, 2005. However the most popular definition did not come until May 13, 2005 by Christopher Reynolds On October 25, 2005 an article titled, Zombie Jesus appeared on Uncyclopedia.com  The photo of Kevin Stewart was taken by fashion blogger Scott Schuman and posted to his website The Sartorialist[11] on July 18th, 2008. He earned the moniker "Professor Badass" that September after appearing in a Demotivational Poster style image on Roflposters.com.[12]  The song "Where Da Hood At" was originally released by the rap artist Earl Simmons, more commonly referred to by his stage name DMX.[1]   The first template relating to sparkledogs, and also believed to be the origin of sparkledogs, was a template uploaded by Coral-APTX on July 13, 2009. The template is here. This template had little more than instuctions and spaces to draw the said sparkledog (or sparkle anything, as the template was open). This first template had moderately-high response, having 15 pages of comments, some being links to the completed templates, since it's upload as of October 17, 2010. A response is shown here:    The first Internet Coke Machine of its kind[4] was created in 1982 by Carnegie Mellon University students Mike Kazar, David Nichols, John Zsarnay and Ivor Durham, in the School of Computer Science department. The official webpage[5] sums up the history of the concept and how the idea was executed: This message let you know that cold Coke could be had by pressing the lower-left or lower-center button, while the bottom bottles in the two right-hand columns had been loaded an hour or so beforehand, so were still warm. (I think the display changed to just "COLD" after the bottle had been there 3 hours.) This Internet tool offered a real-time check up of the vending machine via a "finger coke@cmu.edu" command and used ARPANET, before being replaced by the World Wide Web protocols in the mid-1990s.  The phrase was originally quoted by the character Dan in the 1992 Christian film Second Glance.[1] In the movie, Dan struggles with his faith in Christianity after becoming convinced he would be able to date an attractive girl if he was not religious. Dan's faith is subsequently restored after an angel shows him what life would be like if he were not Christian. At the end of the film, Dan sees a friend in the hallway and says, "Hey, Scotty: Jesus, man." The final scene was uploaded by YouTuber lucienpsinger on November, 13th, 2008. According to YouTube statistics, the video remained relatively obscure until March 15th, 2010, when it began receiving referral traffic from the social news site Reddit. The original upload has since been removed.          On February 13th, 2008, YouTuber foodeatsppl uploaded a clip of Gabe Newell giving commentary on the Gravel Pit in Team Fortress 2 (shown below). The word "gaben" comes from Gabe Newell's email address, gaben@valvesoftware.com. In December 2004, Mason, Ohio electrical engineer Carson Williams[1] set up a Christmas light display at his home using more than 16,000 bulbs. The lights were synchronized to the Trans-Siberian Orchestra's instrumental song “Wizards in Winter”[2], which played on an FM frequency for people driving by from 6-10 PM every night. Williams uploaded a video of the display[13] directly to the Planet Christmas forums[3] in February 2005.[4] A video titled "Been Counting Money"[2] was uploaded to YouTube in February of 2009. The video features a shirtless Ju of D4L, an Alabama-based MC who unbands several stacks of 20 dollar bills and fans them out all over his pool table and floor. The original YouTube video has since been removed by the uploader.  [Currently researching] Baby Courage Wolf was first seen on June 16th on Funnyjunk and BestMemes, and presumably earlier on Memegenerator. The phrase was originally uttered by Nintendo executive Reggie Fils-Aime[1] during the company's demonstration of Wii Fit at the E3 press conference held on July 11th, 2007. As Japanese game designer Shigeru Miyamoto and translator Bill Trinen unveiled the Wii Balance Board, Fils-Aime walked up onto the stage and stated "My body…My body is ready" before stepping onto the accessory to start the demonstration. Fils-Aime's awkward phrasing was met by a mild and somewhat uneasy laughter from the audiences and the quote went largely unnoticed in the gaming communities for years until mid-June 2010. The cropped image of Samus' face comes from a 2009 upload by user Rman0712 on Rule 34 Paheal[1], though the original use of the image is a status of debate. It is thought to have been derived from the humor site Funnyjunk, however there could be evidence to support its origin on 4chan.  Keanu Reeves initially earned his internet fame in June 2010 through a paparazzi photo of the actor sullenly eating a sandwich on a park bench, which spawned an extensive series of photoshopped images known as Sad Keanu. Meanwhile, fans of Sad Keanu and the actor on Facebook took the joke to the next level by celebrating the "Cheer Up Keanu Day"[10] on June 15th, 2010. Within the first week of launch, more than 14,000 Facebook users joined the group. The "Happy Keanu" meme first emerged in October 2010, shortly after the rise of the first Sad Keanu spin-off series "Sad Keanu in a Helmet" in late July. The photograph[1] was taken by on October 6th, 2010 in New York City's East Village neighborhood, where Reeves was working on a running scene for the 2012 film Generation Um.       In early 2010, a Polish user uploaded a video called "Niezapomniana 18" (translated to "Unforgettable 18" in English) of a young man named Krzycha, presumably turning eighteen, getting whipped with a belt. However, is important to note that in Poland, it is often tradition to receive 18 belt slaps on your 18th birthday. The original video is now removed from YouTube, but there are many mirrors available. Mirror: The father stops the whipping and eventually leaves the room, but not without saying, "Koniec Imprezy," and "Dziękuję, Dobranoc" meaning "The event is over" and "Thank you, Good Night" respectively in English. Much of the humor derived from the video comes from these phrases, and is used like the English phrase, "Party's over." There are suspicions that the boy is mentally retarded because he did not fight back or say anything, and a girl held his hand and pointed at him as if he were a child. The single “Dynamite” by Taio Cruz was released on May 30th, 2010, and it managed to reach the #1 spot on the UK Singles Chart and Canadian Hot 100 and #2 on the US Billboard Hot 100[1] by August that year. Rhyming variations of the original lyric began appearing online as early as in July 2010 with over 20 versions collected in a Yahoo! Answers thread.[5]   Prior to her political affiliation with the Tea Party movement, Christine O'Donnell[1] worked as a political commentator promoting conservative Christian values in a number of major news media outlets, including Bill Maher's 1990's late night talk show Politically Incorrect. During the 2010 special election to fill Vice President Joe Biden's vacated Senate seat in Delaware, O'Donnell's interviews from that time were brought back into the political spotlight by Maher on his HBO talk show Real Time, as he threatened to air one clip per episode until she appeared on his new show. On the September 17th, 2010 episode of Real Time, Maher selected a portion from an October 29th, 1999 episode of Politically Incorrect where O'Donnell admitted to dabbling in witchcraft while in high school (shown below, left). On October 4th, 2010, in effort to do damage control after backlash from that commentary, O'Donnell uploaded a simple ad (shown below, right) to her official YouTube channel, Christine4Senate, stating that she is not a witch and is a normal person, just like her constituents. Entitled "Snarling Gray Wolf," the original photograph was taken by nature photographer Jeff Vanuga[1] in Montana and uploaded to Corbis Images[2]. The exact date of upload remains unknown, but Google Insights data shows that the meme began to gain traction beginning sometime in December 2008. According to various accounts including MemeBase[3] and Encyclopedia Dramatica[10], the Courage Wolf macro series was reportedly picked up by 4chan's /b/ (random) board, the birthplace of Advice Dog macro series.  On September 17th, 2005, YTMND user MasterSitsu created a page titled "DEW!!!" that featured a photo of dew on a branch accompanied by a small segment from actor and singer David Hasselhoff's 1994 album title song “Du,” which is an intimate form of subject pronoun "You" in German. [Researching]  During the 2010 Ryder Cup held on October 3rd, 2010, the Daily Mail photographer Mark Pain was hit with a golf ball as Tiger Woods was attempting to make a chip shot in the last hole of the round. Just before the ball hit the lens of Pain’s camera, he snapped a photograph capturing the ball in mid-air, Wood’s look of concern and the curious gazes of the crowd. It was subsequently posted on the Daily Mail[2] website.    [researching] The original song comes from the 1995 movie You're Invited to Mary-Kate & Ashley's Sleepover Party, which was the first part of the You're Invited to Mary-Kate & Ashley's film series. In the film, Mary-Kate, Ashley and their guests tell scary stories, play video games and order a pizza during the slumber party. At one point, the group decides to order a pizza, which arrives with nothing on it. The group then proceeds to top it with a variety of ingredients sourced from their refrigerator during their freestyle rap "Gimme Pizza."[1] On November 27th, 2008, YouTuber[2] jecowa uploaded the first clip of the full song unaltered from its original format, accumulating over 5.5 million views, 28,000 likes and 5,300 dislikes in roughly 13 years (shown below). The catalyst in sparking the video's resurgence was the slowed-down version uploaded by YouTube[3] user philipmserious on September 22nd, 2010. The creepy nature of this version went viral, resulting in reaction videos and other remixes, accumulating over 7.4 million views and 56,000 likes in roughly 11 years (seen below).   The "Never Say No to Panda" ad campaign was created by Advantage Marketing and Advertising for the Arab Dairy Company and aired on Egyptian TV channels in May 2010. The "Office" commercial was first uploaded online by YouTuber zunzun82 on May 18th, 2010. Months later, a compilation of the first three ads was uploaded on September 18th, which gained more than 17 millions views in the span of 22 months. By October 2010, there were more than 200 duplicate uploads, including a dozen of uploads with more than 100,000 views. The ad campaign was nominated for the 2010 Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival and won the 2010 Silver Lion award, one of the few Egyptian commercials ever to win one of the prestigious prizes. The rage face originally came from a panel of KC Green's web comic titled "Euclids on the Block" featuring the famous Greek mathematician (shown below, left). The comic was initially posted on his Livejournal sometime in August 2008 and later included in his Blog Comix (Blomix) series.[1] KC Green is also aware that his comic has been adapted into this meme[2]. Meanwhile, the earliest known instance of the comic to date was submitted by FunnyJunk user TehEman in a post titled "mother of god"[3] (shown above, right) on May 26th, 2010. According to Know Your Meme user petoulachi, an unspecified instance of the comic has been seen on 4chan as early as on June 17th, 2010.   On January 9th, 2000, Fox aired the Simpsons episode "Little Big Mom" aired in the United States.[1] In the episode, Homer Simpsons meets Ned Flanders while skiing. Showing off his new ski suit, Flanders shakes his buttocks in Homer's direction and says, "Feels like I'm wearing nothing at all." Later, while skiing, Homer attempts to recall instruction from his ski teacher, he remembers Flanders shaking his buttocks and saying, "Feels like I'm wearing nothing at all." Homer rejects the memory and says, "Stupid sexy Flanders." While it is likely that fans used the line in everyday speech or online communication, the earliest available reference to the quote comes from a comment on DeviantArt [2] from July 3rd, 2003. That day, DeviantArt[2[ user xx-DAN-xx wrote, "Haha…reminds me of 'Stupid sexy flanders!'"    On December 20th, 1986, an episode of the comedy sketch show Saturday Night Live featured a sketch depicting an alternative ending to the classic Christmas movie It's a Wonderful Life in which the George Bailey beats up Mr. Potter.     Draw Your Life is an exploitable template, closely related to the DeviantArt Age Meme template, that originated on the /b/ board of 4chan in early 2010.     The original remix of Super Mario World's Overworld Theme was created by the famous NND user Hyadain who is also known as the Japanese composer Kenichi Maeyamada. The song was directly posted to NND on February 8th, 2008.[2]  In the Japanese manga Axis Powers Hetalia released in 2006, the character Russia asserts that everyone will eventually "become one" with him while comforting the character China at a bar.[10] The image of the man holding the limes comes from a photo of a display ad for George clothing, perhaps from a Walmart. George is the name of a clothing brand name owned by the British supermarket ASDA (ASquith DAiries), who are owned by Wal-Mart. The reason he is holding limes is to look friendly and also because ASDA has the colour green traditionally. [1] KYM User Morgan Lowe made the following statement regarding the origin: Wow, On april 12th of 2010, My family and I were at walmart. I saw the ad and thought wow how stupid… Limes? Of all things LIMES?!?! LOL I tooke a pic with my phone and uploaded it to facebook. I guess other people did the same haha Never would have thought it would be a meme! I flipped out when I saw this because of all the laughs about it haha good times. The first image macros are suspected to have come from 4chan, but there are no archived threads to confirm this.  The character's facial expression, full of frustration and rage, can be found in Gantz' Chapter 55: Naked King (裸の王様), originally released in February 2002 and the English translation in June 2009.

Introduced in Pokemon Red and Green[24], Lavender Town is the designated graveyard for deceased monsters and is known for its ghost sightings. The first edition of these games was released in Japan in February 1996. By the time the games were released in the United States two years later, the original music for Lavender Town, composed by Junichi Masuda[23] had been changed.[5] Since the ambience of the town was that of a graveyard, the music was relatively creepy, with players on gaming message boards Serebii[2] and NintendoWorlds.net[3] discussing this in 2008 and 2009. A remix[4] of the song appeared in early 2010, attempting to intensify its spookiness. The first version of the creepypasta story was uploaded to Pastebin[1] on February 21st, 2010. It stated that after the first few days after the release of Pokemon Red and Green in Japan, there were over 100 suicides among children ages 10-15. During the investigation, the detective concluded that the music that played in Lavender Town, thanks to a secret code included in 104 of the original cartridges, was driving children to kill themselves. The children were usually found dead through suicide, usually by hanging or jumping from heights. However, some were more odd. A few cases recorded children who had began sawing off their limbs, others sticking their faces inside the oven, and chocked themselves on their own fist, shoving their own arms down their throat. The few children who were saved before killing themselves showed sporadic behavior. When asked why they were going to hurt themselves they only answered in chaotic screams and scratched at their own eyes. When showed what seemed to be the connection to this attitude, the gameboy, they had no response, but when combined with either Pokemon Red or Green, the screams would continue, and they would do their best to leave the room it was located in. This confirmed the authorities suspicion that the games, somehow, had a connection to these children and the deaths. It was a strange case, because many children who had the same games did not show this behavior, but only a few. The police had no choice but to pursue this, since they had no other leads. Collecting all the cartridges these children had purchased, they kept them sealed away as strong evidence to look over later. They decided the first thing to do was to talk to the programmers themselves. The first person they met was the director of the original games, Satoshi Tajiri. When told about the deaths surrounding his games, he seemed slightly uneasy, but admitted nothing. He lead them to the main programmers of the game, the people responsible for the actual content. The detectives met Takenori Oota, one of the main programmers of the game. Unlike Satoshi, he did not seem uneasy, but very kept. Explaining that it was impossible to use something like a game to cause such deaths, and also bringing up the point that not all the children were affected, he brushed it off as some kind of odd coincidence or mass hysteria. It seemed like he was hiding something, but he wasn't giving way. Finally, he did say something interesting. Takenori had heard a rumor going around that the music for Lavender Town, one of the locations in the game, had caused some children to go ill. It was only a rumor, and had no real definite back up, but it was still something to look into. He directed the detectives to Junichi Masuda, the music composer of the series. Masuda had also heard of these rumors, but again said they had no evidence that his music was the cause. Even to prove a point he played the exact song from the game completely through with no effects to anyone, the detectives nor Masuda himself, feeling anything different or odd. Although they still had their suspicions of Masuda and the music of Lavender town, it seemed they had reached another dead end. Going back to the cartridges they had seized from the homes of the children, they decided to take a slightly more direct look at the games. They knew that it was these games that gave the children the ill effects, so they took extreme caution. Popping in the cartridge and turning the console on, the game screen booted. The title screen appeared, and the option to continue or create a new game appeared. When they chose to continue the game, stats of that game appeared. They saw the names of the children who had played, usually "Red" or another simple name. However, the interesting thing was the time played and the number of Pokemon they owned. On every game, the time was very low, and all of them had only a single Pokemon in their inventory. They came to the stunning reality that it could not have been the music from Lavender town that had caused such ill effects in the children, since it was impossible to reach that part of the game in such small amount of time and with only one Pokemon in their inventory. This brought them to the conclusion that something early on in the game had to be the cause. If it wasn't the music, nor the title screen, it had to be something within the first few minutes of the game itself. They had no choice but to turn off the game now and go back to the programmers. Asking for a list of all the programmers from Takenori, they found, surprisingly, that one of the programmers had committed suicide shortly after the game was released. His name was Chiro Miura, a very obscure programmer who had provided very little for the game. Even more interestingly, he had requested his name did not appear in the credits of the game, and so it was not. Looking over the evidence found at Chiro's apartment, they found many notes written in bold marker. Most of it was crumbled, or marked out, making it very difficult to read. They few words they could find in the mess was "Do not enter"., "Watch out" and "COME FOLLOW ME" in bold. The detectives were unsure what these meant, but knew they had to have a connection. Further searching, they discovered Chiro was good friends with one of the map designers, Kohji Nisino, and this was probably the only reason Chiro had given a part in making the game. Kohji Nisino, since the release of the game, had locked himself in his apartment, barely leaving in the dark of night to fetch anything he might need. He told his friends and family he was mourning for his dear friend Chiro, but they didn't believe this, since Nisino had locked himself up the day the game was put in stores, a few days before Chiro had killed himself. It was troubling, but the authorities finally persuaded Nisnino to sit down and speak with them. He looked as if he hadn't slept in days, dark rings under his eyes. He stunk, his nails had grown black and his hair was greasy, sticking to his forehead and neck. He spoke in stutters and murmurs, but at least he had something to say. When asked if he knew anything about the children who had died after exposure of the game and if it had any connection to the game, he answered them seemingly carefully, choosing his words thoughtfully before answering. He told them that his friend Chiro had an interesting idea with the game, something he had wanted to try since he heard the project was starting. Nisino himself knew Takenori, the director and main programmer, for a long time, so he could easily get a mediocre programmer in on the project with a little persuasion. It seemed Chiro had convinced Nisino to get him in on the project, and it had worked. The detectives knew they were on to something. This unknown obscure programmer, Chiro, had to have something to do with it, something… They asked what Chiro's idea was, why he wanted so badly to have a part in making this children's game. Nisino told them that Chiro never told him much about it, other than a few details every now and then. He wanted to insert a special Pokemon in the game, one completely different from all the others. It would serve as an extra, a kind of out of place thrill for the player. It wasn't, however, Missing No. It couldn't be. With the gameplay time recorded on the cartridges, it was impossible for the children to have time to meet that Pokemon. Nisino, throughout the entire conversation, seemed to break down even more with every question. The detectives pushed him more and more, searching through his mind for any and every scrap of knowledge this man had no game and Chiro… and Chiro's intentions… It was when they asked about the notes found in Chiro's home that he snapped. From under the couch Nisino was sitting on he whipped out a pistol, pointing it straight at the police while backing away a few steps. Then, just as quickly, he brought the pistol to his face. "Don't follow me…" muttered Nisino as he stuck the pistol in his mouth and pulled the trigger. It was too quick for the police to react. It was done. Nisino had killed himself, repeating slightly differently what was written on one of Chiro's papers… It seemed all leads had finally died. The team who had created this original game were splitting up, becoming harder to find. It was as if they were keeping a secret. When the police finally managed to talk with anyone who had parts in the game, even the obscure character designers or monster designers, it seemed they had nothing of interest to say. Most of them didn't even know Chiro, and the few who did only seen him once or twice working on the game itself. Throughout all of this the only confirmation they had was that Chiro was indeed the one who had worked on the very early parts of the game. It had been a couple of months after the original children suicides and the death rate had dropped dramatically. It seemed that the game was no longer giving any ill effects to any children. The call back of the games that was planned was canceled, since it seemed the game was no longer harming any children. They had began to think that maybe Takenori was right and it was all just a very odd coincidence or mass hysteria… Until they received the letter. It was given to one of the detectives himself, quite directly out on the street. It was a woman who gave him the note, a very frail, thin, sick looking thing. She gave him the letter quickly, telling him it was something he needed to see, and without waiting for a response or another word, she disappeared into the crowd. The detective brought it to his office, and calling the others in, he brought it out and read it aloud. It was a letter written by Chiro himself, but it wasn't one found at his apartment. They had throughly searched and cleared out the place, so wherever this letter had come from, it wasn't kept at his home. It was signed to be given to Nisino. It started off quite formal, a hello, how are you, regards to the family, and such. After one or two of these normal paragraphs, they reached a section that requested Nisino to get him into the game team, to get him a programming position in Pokemon Red and Green. As the letter continued, the handwriting seemed to grow more jittery. He talked about a glorious idea he had, a way to program something unseen in any game before. He said it would certainly revolutionize not only the gaming industry, but everyone. He went on to say that it was a very simple procedure to program this idea into the game. He did not even have to add any foreign programming, but could use what was already given in the game itself. This would, the detectives agreed, make it impossible to notice any obscurities in the programming itself. It was a perfect way to hide whatever this was. The letter ended abruptly. There was no goodbye, no say hi to the family, no write back, or thank you. Nothing like that. It was just his name, written hard in the letter where the paper almost broke through. It was only his name. "Chiro Miura." This was the nail in the coffin for the detectives. They had no more suspicion about the cause. Chiro had programmed something into the early parts of the game, something maddening. To further increase this streak of success, they discovered that the programming team had worked in pairs, even Chiro himself. He had worked with another programmer, Sousuke Tamada. If anyone knew what the secret in this game was, Sousuke Tamada would be the man. This was their final hope of unraveling this mystery once and for all. They learned Sousuke had provided a lot of programming to the game, and seemed to be an average, good guy and worker. They were easily allowed into his home, a fair place, and they entered his living room where they sat. Sousuke did not sit, however. He stood by the window of the second story floor, looking out onto the busy street. He was smiling a little. There is no direct witnesses to the events that followed. The only thing from this conversation that remained was found on a voice recorder sitting on the table in front of the two detectives assigned to talk to Sousuke. What follows is the unedited recording: "Sousuke Tamada, what part did you have in the games Pokemon Red and Green?" asked the first detective. "I was a programmer." His voice was light, friendly, almost too friendly. "That's all." "Am I right in knowing that the programmers working on the game worked in teams?" asked the detective. One could hear the voice of feet moving on the floor slightly. "You would be right," said Sousuke after a moment of silence. "And your partner, his name was--" The detective was quickly cut off by Sousuke eerie voice. "Chiro Miura… That was his name. Chiro Miura." Another silence. It seemed the detectives were a little uneasy about this man. "Could you tell us if Muira ever acted strange at all? Any particular behaviors you observed while working with him at all?" Sousuke answered them. "I don't know him that well, really. We didn't meet up frequently, only every once in a while to trade data, or when the entire group was called up for a meeting… That's the only times I really ever saw him. He acted normal, as far as I could tell. He was a short man, and I think this affected his consciousness.. He acted weaker than any other man I met. He was willing to do a lot of work to gain recognition, this I do know. I think…" Silence. "Yes?" asked the detective, pushing for him to continue. "You think what?" "I think he was a very weak man. I think he wanted to prove himself regardless of this point… I think he wanted to make himself known for something special, something that would make people forget about the way he looked and pay attention to the powerful mind that lay inside his skull.. Unfortunately for him, however.. heheh.. He didn't have much of a mind to back up that reasoning." "Why do you say that?" asked the second detective. "Well it's the simple truth," answered Sousuke quickly. His feet could be heard moving across the tiled floor. "He was nothing special, even if he wanted to believe so. You can't become greatness, even if you believe it. It's impossible… Somehow, I think Chiro knew this himself, somewhere deep in there, he knew it." The detectives were silent again, not sure how to steer the conversation. After a moment, they continued. "Can you tell us what Chiro's part of the game was? What did he work on exactly?" Sousuke answered more quickly than before. "Nothing… I mean, nothing important. He worked on some obscure parts of the beginning of the game." A pause, then a little more information. "It was Oak's part to be exact. He worked on some of Oak's parts… When he's seen first, you see.." "What else?" pushed the police. They could hear it in Sousuke's voice. He knew something. "We know you know about the children and the deaths. We know it was Chiro who did it. He programmed something in the game." "What are you implying?" asked Sousuke. It sounded like he was trying to maintain his voice. "We're implying that since your his partner, if you're hiding something from us then you could just as much be responsible for those children's deaths as Chiro is himself!" "You can't prove anything!" Sousuke shouted. "Tell us what Chiro did to the game!" they shouted back. "WHAT I TOLD HIM TO." Silence. Complete silence. "You want to know, huh?" asked Sousuke finally, breaking the eerie silence, but replacing it with his voice. "You want to know what is this all about? Chiro was an idiot. He'd do anything for a bit of attention, anything at all. He couldn't program worth a shit either. The one thing he could do, however, was be manipulated. You could tell him what to do, and he'd do it. He wouldn't even question it, he'd do it. Just to hear that 'thank you' when you received the finish product, that was his reasons. That's all he wanted." Two clicks from the detective's guns could heard. "I could control his flawlessly. He's a lot like Takenori… Of course none of you knew this, but I was the one who brought up the idea of the game, the idea of the entire operation. I just told the fellow what to do, and he followed me without doubt. He knows nothing, just like Chiro." A sound of a window opening could be heard, follow by the detectives. "Don't move or we'll shoot!" "Let me tell you about a mechanic in the game," continued Sousuke. His voice was more rushed, but it still held that slyness. "Consider it a hint, alright? If you walk around in grassy areas enough a Pokemon will appear, and you'll have the chance to go into battle with it. It's a necessary part of the game overall, you see?" "Step away from the window! We won't warn you again!" "At the start of the game you have to walk into the grassy area before Oak appears and you receive your first Pokemon, understand me? Under normal circumstances, it was programmed that even though you're in a grassy area, no Pokemon will spawn… I made it different. I manipulated that Chiro, told him what to put in the program, gave him all the instructions on how to do it, and he did it flawlessly. It's rare, but it can happen.. Stepping into that grass, one can spawn…" "Sousuke, we don't want to shoot!" "Shoot me?" asked Souske, laughing at the same time. "Shoot ME? You're as dumb as Chiro was! Once he found out the truth, he had to end it! It was his fault after all! He shot himself because of it! If you're so determined to finish that case of yours, if you want to know, play the damn game for yourself! Roll the wheel, and who knows? Maybe you'll learn the secret for yourself!" A shot could be heard, loud enough to distort the audio. Sounds of screaming, murmuring could be heard. The table the recorder was on crashed. Ear shattering distortions. Silence. Then laughing. Sousuke was laughing, and then words. "Come follow me… Come follow me…" And then nothing. The recorder continued to record until the tape ran out. There was nothing else on it. The police arrived on the scene quickly, and to their horror they discovered Sousuke and the two detectives dead. They had all been shot, but not after struggling. The detectives had been shot multiple times, at least ten each, before dying after being shot in between their eyes. Sousuke himself had clearly died of two shots to his chest, straight through the heart. This game was causing a massacre. At least a hundred children were dead. Nisino, the unexpecting friend, dead. Chiro, the manipulated toy, dead. The two detectives, dead. And now, even the creator, the cause of this atrocity, Sousuke, dead. This game was stretching far over it's original intentions. It was killing anyone and everyone who got involved. The lead detective had decided to put this case away. He man who committed the crime was dead, so there was no longer any reason to continue the case. All evidence, all the cartridges, all the notes, all the letters, they were locked away, kept in the darkness where they belonged. There were talks about the entire thing, small conversations every now and then, but over the years even these began to fade away. Eventually, the case was only a memory in the minds of those who experienced it first hand. Ten years passed. February 27, 2006 was the date. The lead detective, the man who locked away the original evidence ten years previous, was reminded of the awful event that occurred. Although he was no longer in the force, he still had access to files and was helped when he could. The reminder of the event caused him to look back, to open the sealed container that held all the evidence collected. He read through the letters and the notes. He remembered the woman who had appeared to him on the street that one day and handed him that letter that lead to the change of the entire case. He wondered who she was, and where she had come from. Perhaps she was Chiro's mother… or maybe Sousuke's. It was far too late to pursue any of this. Far too late.. Sealing the container again, he saw a second one directly behind it. Pulling it out, he read the note on top of it. "Evidence #2104A" He opened it up, and looked inside. Filling the container were exactly 104 Pokemon Red and Green cartridges, each one in perfect condition, untouched since the day they had last checked them ten years ago. He reached in and pulled one out, Pokemon Red. He hadn't seen one in a long time. He didn't know what he thought next, but he reached in his desk and pulled out an old Gameboy. He received it a long time ago, but it still worked. It was his son's, but he had died a few years ago. His wife was gone too. That was then though. Popping in the cartridge in the back of the Gameboy he turned on the system. The title screen. Then the option to continue or start a new game. "Tanaka." That was the child's name, the one who played it first. He was probably dead, along with all the others. He pressed New Game, and started a new game. It was normal, average. He walked around, talked to his mother, went outside. He started walking towards the grass. In his head, he could still hear Sousuke's words. Even though he was not there, even though he had never seen the man in his life, he could still see him, hear him. "Come follow me." He was getting closer and closer, only a step or two away. "Roll the wheel, and who knows? Maybe you'll learn the secret for yourself!" He entered the grass. The screen did nothing at first. Nothing at all. It just sat there, and so did the detective, completely frozen, as if time had stopped just for them. The screen went black. and then lit up again, the iconic green background with black text appearing. The lead detectives weary eyes grew wide. He couldn't help but read out what was there in front of him. "Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me. I miss you dad, I miss you my husband, I miss you so much." Tears formed in his eyes, falling down his cheeks. Screens and screens of text appeared and he rapidly clicked the A button to continue it. It was his wife and his child. They were speaking to him, calling to him, crying with him. They wanted to see him, they loved him, he loved them. "I love you too," muttered the man in a hoarse, scratching voice. "Come follow me, become new again. We want to see you and hold you, and be with you forever and ever and ever and ever." "AND EVER AND EVER…" "Don't stay away. You can see us too.. We miss you.. Come follow me. We love yo--" A black screen. The detectives eyes grew wide, his jaw dropping. The screen lit back up, and Oak was leading him out of the grass. "Come follow me," said Oak. "NO!" shouted the man, dropping the game onto the floor. He quickly fell forward, reaching for it, bringing the screen back to his face. "Bring them back, bring them back to me!" The game continued on as usual, not responding to the detective at all. "My wife, my child, listen to me! Bring them back to me, I said!" Voices… He heard voices, hundreds of voices. He turned around from his seat, looking behind him, and standing in his small room were children, many children. Some had no eyes, some had rings around their throats, some were burned all across their body. They were screaming, reaching towards him. "Bring back my mommy, bring back my daddy, bring back my pet!" they all screamed out, reaching for the game, their mouths agape with horror and pain. "I don't want them to go away, bring them back to me, bring them back to me!" "No!" shouted the detective. "It's mine! My family is here, don't touch it!" Horror was across his face. "Come follow me…" said a voice. The lead detective looked over, and in the corner of his room, next to an old desk, was Sousuke. He stood in the corner, tall, handsome, clean. A smile was on his face, stretching across his face. "Come follow me…" The lead detective jumped up, stepping back, trying to force away the children crawling towards him, reaching out for the game held tightly within his hands. "Wh-what's going on here!? What's going on!? Where is my family!?" Sousuke smiled generously. "I'll show you. I'll help you get away from them, you see? Just follow me." Sousuke reached down, and opened a drawer on the old desk. The lead detective, pushing through the crowd of children, trying to get away, looked inside. Siting there, covered with dust, was his old gun from when he was on the force. He had not used that gun in many years and had put it away, not wanting to remember the things he had to do with it. But right now he didn't see it as something that caused pain or that killed. It was shining, it was light. It was something that could set him free. "Just follow me," said Sousuke, picking up the gun and putting it in the lead detectives hand. He formed his hand to hold the gun, then brought it up to his temple. "Just pull the trigger. That's all." The lead detective turned around. The children were crawling at him, grabbing his legs and pulling at him. They reached for the game. He turned back towards Sousuke, and smiled. "My family… I'll follow you." He pulled the trigger. Bang. His brains spread the wall as he fell to the ground, dead. It was a few days before the body was discovered. It lay on the floor, blood everywhere. In one hand held an empty gun, and in the other was a classic Gameboy with Pokemon Red on the back. The battery had long died, and only an empty, black screen was left. This was the final murder that the remaining authorities would allow. The last detective who was ever a part of this case personally carried all 104 cartridges away, and burned them all, making sure not a single one survived. There would taunt no more. However, this is not the end of the story. The code was said to have survived, and was even passed on to other language versions of the games. If you have an old Pokemon game, you can place the cartridge in the back of the classic Gameboy, turn on the system, and roll the wheel who knows? Maybe you'll learn the secret for yourself.  On November 12th of 2009, Luo Yuefeng was seen passing out flyers on the streets of Shanghai. She was fairly average looking, about 4'9", and looking for a marriage partner. 1.

In 2008 photographer Tom Wilson was approached by a couple requesting a portrait taken of them together, when asked what type of picture, they replied "something classy." This picture is the result of the photo shoot. Uploaded with ImageShack.us  The song was used as the ending theme for the first and second seasons of the anime Axis Powers Hetalia. The song was originally sung by Daisuke Namikawa in the voice of North Italy. The song caught on quickly with fans due to it's upbeat tempo and cutesy, almost nonsensical lyrics. It was released as a single on the Marukaite Chikyuu album, the first soundtrack to the anime adaptation of the show, on March 25th, 2009. Not long after the release of the first soundtrack, the first DVD was released on April 24th, 2009. The first volume contained a bonus CD that included a version of the song that was sung by Hiroki Yasumoto in the voice of Germany. Following in suit, the next volume of the DVD was released on May 22nd, 2009, and contained versions of the song that were sung by Hiroki Takahashi and Noriaki Sugiyama in the voices of Japan and England, respectively. The trend continued with each release of the DVDs. As of now, there are 18 versions of the song, including North Italy's, that have been released officially. There have even been versions released for Chibitalia (Little Italy) and Holy Roman Empire. As this interview from July 2010 shows, Daniel Songer began writing and performing his high energy "comedy acts" in 2007 (uploading them to his youtube channel danpoetman). His first video can be seen below. This was followed by dozens more videos (in September 2010 Songer's youtube channel hosts more than 140) all of which featured the same peculiar delivery and random joke structure as the first, and are filmed in or around the back yard of Songer's Georgia home. Some of the recent topics he has covered in his routines are "Girls Like Public Sex", "Honk If You're Horny" and "Men Jerk Off".     The meme originated from the movie "Kick-Ass", which was directed by Matthew Vaughn. Near the end of the movie, a bodyguard is in a hopeless situation when the character "Hit-girl" kills one of the other bodyguards. The specific bodyguard then says "Fuck this shit, i'm getting the bazooka".       According to Urban Dictionary and ED, FYIAD originated from an otherkin argument on livejournal.com. LiveJournal user StarBlade posted an entry in the debate section regarding Otherkin, "Fuck you, I'm a Dragon" became the defensive cry of many of the Dragon otherkin in the debate. Now, the phrase can be used in any situation; however, it's typically still used in it's traditional form. This meme is not to be confused with the "F*ck you! I'm an Anteater!" meme that originated from LOLcats.      On August 23rd, 2007, YouTube released an update to its comments section interface that allowed users to "thumbs up" or "thumbs down" comments. On March 25th, 2010, the site rolled out a new "Highest Rated Comments" section, which prominently displayed the highest voted comments in a separate area on the video page.[2] Soon after, comments containing upvote pleas began appearing on the site.    On Tuesday September 14, 2010 the Egyptian government newspaper Al-Ahram published a photo in which the Egyptian leader is leading the delegation of heads of government to start peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians in the White House. Were also in the photo Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, King Abdullah of Jordan and the leader of the Palestinian National Authority, Mahmoud Abbas. Immediately, the opposition media spread the lie that an Egyptian blogger found that the image had been retouched. Supposedly, the real picture, taken by photographer Alex Wong for the agency Getty, was Obama who was leading the procession. Thanks to photoshop, the figure of Mubarak was cut and placed at center stage, as if it was he who commanded the group of political leaders. Original picture Fabricated Image Elcadillo.org (English translation), a Spanish website, satirically claimed Mubarak's photo was not fabricated and "proved" it by using what would become the first alterations from the meme : He has led the New York marathon as was never in the last place He was the first to participate in the festival of San Fermin in Pamplona He lead the Israeli gay parade in Tel-Aviv He is also a great leader as he is known as the first guide of the great migration of dinosaurs . After the news surfaced in International news outlets such as the BBC and The Guardian, gossip site Gawker, and even Gizmodo, Al-Ahram chief editor Ossama Saraya issued a rather unapologetic statement in his weekly column claiming the pictures was not a fabrication, but rather an "expressive" photo highlighting Egypt's leading role in the peace talks. In response, Egyptian users on Twitter started poking fun at Saraya's statement. In addition many Facebook users fired back at Saraya with their own versions of "expressive" photos, such as this one And This And this (Soheir Zaky, famous Egyptian belly-dancer inaugurating peace talks) And this (Obviously poking fun at Mubarak taking his son Gamal along, supposedly to win the approval of the US administration for him succeeding his father)  The video later called as sm666, "A cursed video in niconico" (ニコニコ呪いの動画, Niconico Noroi no Douga) was made by Piropito for Slashup05 (slashup05 熱冬祭 MovieBattle), an online flash movie festival held in the end of December 2007, and it was uploaded to NND on 28th of that month.[2] This video tells a fictional story of verifying creepy posts about a NND's video which id is "sm666" in 2channel's /occult/ (paranormal & spiritual phenomenon) board. The actual "sm666" video was a mere MAD videos for a Japanese TV anime R.O.D: Read or Die[3] which was uploaded on March 6th, 2007 (shown below)[4] and it had been already removed at some point in that year before Piropito uploaded the video. Two months later, the YouTube version of sm666, username:666, was posted on February 28th, 2008. As shown by its title, this YouTube edition is a visual description of how someone took the plunge into a YouTube channel called "666", also known as the devil's number, which was originally suspended, but through countless refreashes, makes it so, leading to a slowly decaying YouTube page with weird videos and eventually the Devil inside taking over. A demonic and gruesome video appearing inside the video in the last part is his another work "Drowned woman" (溺れる女), better known as YouTube's video title "none", that was released on September of the same year.[5] On May 16th, 1994, computer science student Achim Held of the University of Kiel submitted a message to the de.talk.bizarre[7] newsgroup on Usenet, in which he claimed that he and a small group of friends discovered that the city of Bielefeld did not actually exist. Held speculated that a secret society may be behind the conspiracy, which may have infilitrated the German government. According to a 2004 interview with Held, the joke was inspired by a conversation with an avid reader of New Age magaziines at a student party in 1993.[8][6] On January 23rd, 2009, DeviantART user angelaArt[1] uploaded a short one page comic called ADVENTURE[2], featuring herself and fellow Deviantart artist Lizcakes [3]. The original version had the line "Angie grab my boobs" and the duo flying off accompanied by the word ADVENTURE.   The video was posted on August 2nd, 2010 and took off within a few days of the first posting, becoming a viral hi around August 9th, eventually reaching over 2.4 million views after only a month, and gaining various remixes, auto-tunes, and re-posts along the way, although none have reached the views of the original. Many of the reposts have come close to the original video's views, with some having as much as two million. The concert in question actually took place in December, 2009, at a Christmas-themed radio event in Sacramento. The item in question, although most often known as a water bottle, was revealed by Justin Bieber through comments on the first video posted of that concert (posted on December 1, 2009) to be a bag of Sour Patch Kids wrapped in a "I <3 Bieber" T-shirt.    On August 10th, 2009, 4chan user the_solipist posted a thread on /x/ (paranormal) board describing a video clip that was so disturbing, it would cause viewers to experience nausea, nightmares and could make them commit suicide. In the thread, the_solipist shared several dark screen captures of an infant he claimed were taken from the video.  The 4-pane comic series was conceived on 4chan's /a/ board around April 14th, 2009. One of the earliest archived thread of one of the comics in the series can be found on the Green-Oval archive[1]. It spread throughout various forums and imageboards circa early 2009, with the earliest known non-4chan thread on Grand Holy Empire of Batta forum[2] dating back to April 18th, 2009. The original comic illustrates a rather entertaining conversation about Japanese animes between the father and the son: On September 11th, 2010, a group of fundamentalist Christians led by local preacher David Grisham held an event at a city park to burn a gasoline-soaked copy of the Qur'an, supposedly in memorial of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. According to Amarillo Globe-News, approximately 200 people showed up to protest the planned burning, including a 23 year old resident Jacob Isom who rescued the bible from a grill stand while it was left unattended by Grisham. In the lore and storyline of World of Warcraft, Kael'thas Sunstrider was the former leader of the Blood Elves who sided with the rogue Demon Hunter Illidan Stormrage. In World of Warcraft's first expansion pack, The Burning Crusade, Kael'thas became the final raid boss of the dungeon Tempest Keep: The Eye, during which he was noted for having very long speeches during the encounter that players had to listen to every time, as well as being surprisingly difficult (25 skilled players at the highest level were required to defeat him). In March 2008, Patch 2.4.0 Fury of the Sunwell was released, which revealed that although Kael'thas was defeated and presumably dead in Tempest Keep, he returns as a Wretched (an insane and deformed Blood Elf) bent on summoning Kil'Jaeden, a powerful Demon Lord, to destroy the planet. He once again becomes the final boss in the 5-man dungeon Magister's Terrace. During this encounter, Kael'thas opens with the following dialogue: In the season premiere of Amazing Race (Season 17, 2010), a contestant named Claire Champlin of the Home Shopping Network team was given a simple task of catapulting watermelon at stationary targets several meters down a field. After missing several attempts, Claire re-evaluates her strategy and tries again. This time, however, the watermelon gets caught in the loading band and launches back at her face exploding into a red misty cloud of fruit. The contestant was not injured in the incident, but has been quoted as saying "I had the worst headache of my life".       The original music video was directed by Jake Nava, and choreographed by Frank Gatson and JaQuel Knight. The video was made on a small budget due to the large amount spent on Beyonce's video for the title single If I Were A Boy. Knowles premiered the music videoson MTV's Total Request Live show on October 13th, 2008. The format and choreography were inspired by Gwen Verdon's performance of Mexican Breakfast on the Ed Sullivan Show in 1969     The original photo used in the meme was taken during the UEFA final between Feyenoord Rotterdam of Netherlands and Borussia of Dortmund, Germany, on May 8th, 2002. The image of a young Feyenoord fan, later revealed to be 5-year-old Mikey Wilson, shows a boy showing support for his team, with his face painted white and red while wearing a Kappa soccer jersey, and a middle finger extended in animosity towards the opposing squad (shown below). The original image was taken by Reuters photographer Jasper Juinen just before the 2002 UEFA final.[2] Before the match, there was a moment of silence for the controversial Dutch Politician Pim Fortuyn.[1] Fortuyn, an outspoken critic of Islam, had been assassinated two days prior. German fans objected to the moment silence. Many Dutch fans, including Wilson, reacted by flipping the bird. The photo encapsulated the stereotypical image of the wild, die-hard, over-the-top fanaticism of European football hooligans. Although it appeared online at least as early as 2008, it was primarily used with the original, unaltered image in profile pictures or as a reaction image before it appeared as a meme. The exact first use of the viral image in meme form is unknown, but early examples appeared around 2010 (examples shown below, left and right).  He was portrayed by iconic Japanese actor Hiroshi Fujioka, who until that point was most known for his role of Takeshi Hongo, aka Kamen Rider 1. Segata Sanshiro's name is a pun of Sanshiro Sugata, the title character from Akira Kurosawa's film from 1943, and the phrase Sega Satan Shiro! which translates to "You must play Sega Saturn!", which is a phrase he uses in every commercial. In the commercials, Segata is depicted as a master of multiple forms of martial arts, living atop a mountain, carrying a giant Sega Saturn and controller on his back for training purposes to fulfill his duties towards "serious gaming". In the ads he tracks down and punishes those who do not play the Sega Saturn. A line from the final episode of the animated series "Super Mario World" called Mama Luigi when Luigi is tucking Yoshi into bed and and when Yoshi complains that he has to go to bed so early Luigi replies "… early to bed, early to catch the worm, or is it the bagel?". Seen in the first minute of this video: Portal[1] is a single-player first-person action/puzzle video game developed by Valve Corporation and released on October the 9th, 2007 as part of a bundle package called "The Orange Box" for Windows and Xbox 360. Towards the end of the game, the player takes on a mission to destroy "GlaDOS", a homicidal Artificial Intelligence program, along with her 4 personality cores. After the detonation of facility and as the player is led into a warehouse, GlaDOS begins singing the song happily, suggesting that she is in fact "Still Alive." On September 7th, 2010, 4chan[6] user Jadusable posted a thread about his experiences with a haunted Majora's Mask cartridge for the N64. He explained that after receiving a suspicious looking Majora's Mask cartridge from an old man, he went to his dorm-room to play it and noticed it had a save file named "BEN" on it. He decided to ignore it and created a new file, but during the course of the game characters would refer to him as "BEN" at various moments. Figuring it would help the problem, Jadusable deleted the "BEN" save file, but this caused characters to not refer to his name at all. He then attempted to perform the "4th day glitch", a hack that allows players to get an entire extra day to the game, and was ported to the Majora boss battle at the end of the game. He noticed that text was being displayed incorrectly, and the music being played was a reversed version of the game's "Song of Healing" before being ported back to Clock Town. At Clocktown he discovered that the textures were missing, the music was distorted and the town was empty of the normal characters. He began posting links to YouTube videos he claims to have recorded while playing. While it is unclear who coined the term "O Face," its mainstream popularity can be attributed to the 1999 workplace comedy film Office Space. In the film, the term is uttered by one of the main character's colleagues Greg Pitts (played by actor Greg Pitts) while performing the "air-humping" gesture. The song was released on October 19th, 1984 by Warner Bros Records as the band's first single and later featured on their debut album Hunting High and Low. The music video is set in an alternate world where the female protagonist meets a male character from the comic book she is reading. The music video received acclaim for its plot and for its use of the rotoscoping technique[1].  On May 4th, 2007, YouTuber messinwithbigfoot published the video "Multimedia message (mr krabs.3gp)." They wrote in the description of the video, "video uploaded from my mobile phone." Within 13 years, the video received more than 3,600 views (shown below). The story describes a Pokémon Silver game purchased from a Gamestop that apparently malfunctions in a glitch-like fashion, throwing the player into the Bellsprout Tower area with 5 Unown Pokémon and a Cyndaquil. The player continues through a series of screens where his Pokémon changes several times to different combinations of Unownthat spell out the words “LEAVE”, “HEDIED”, “DYING”, “NOMORE” and “IMDIED” at the end of the game. In addition, the player’s avatar is described as missing its limbs and having blood running down its eyes. The earliest known posting of the pasta comes from a 4chan thread submitted on June 6th, 2010. You see, I am a simple college student living alone in an apartment. I was very enthusiastic about the release of Pokemon HeartGold/SoulSilver here in the states. I have purposely locked myself out of all media and the internet aside for school purposes. That means no 4chan, no /v/, no Bulbapedia, etc. As I was busy with the school year and being poor at the time, I wasn’t able to buy SoulSilver on launch date. After my school year ended, I ordered SoulSilver on Amazon. However, it would take a week for it to arrive. I decided that during that time, I replay my Crystal version on my Gameboy Color. However, I realized that long ago, my mom threw it away because I told her the save went dead, and I was very upset about it then. She also threw away my Silver version, so all I have is my Gameboy Color. As such, I set out to Gamestop and bought a used Silver version, as it’s the only Pokemon game left that they have for the GBC. Ten dollars – fairly cheap despite it being Gamestop. I went home and started it up for a nostalgia trip. However, that’s where things started getting bizarre, and most likely the reason why you read this. The Gamefreak logo started up as normal, but it just froze there. I thought the cart was just errored or something, so I turned it off and on. The same thing happened. I tried pressing A and Start over and over, and all of the buttons. Eventually, the logo vanished and there was a black screen for about five seconds. Suddenly, rather than going to the usual menu screen, I was already in the game in a previous saved file, which was odd as I was expecting all of these carts to have been wiped by the poor battery. Either way, I wasn’t complaining, as I would have chosen the “Continue” option to see what the previous guy did anyways. First off, I checked his trainer information. His name was just “…” – He didn’t have much originality. I checked his profile and apparently he had 999:99 hours put into the game, with all 16 badges, 999999 Pokedollars and all 251 Pokemon on the Pokedex. Seeing as he apparently had Mew and Celebi logged also, I am guessing he either used a Game Genie or is a really hardcore Pokemon player back then. I checked his Pokemon to see what badass team he has. To my surprise, I saw 5 Unowns and a sixth Pokemon named “HURRY”. I’m thinking that this must be some cruel joke by the person who last played this game, but I decided to check the profiles of those Pokemon anyways. As expected, they were different letters of Unown, all Level 5. I was a bit shaky with my Unown alphabet at the time, but I identified the word spelled out to be “LEAVE”. As for the sixth Pokemon, it turned out to be a Cyndaquil (mind you, this is before there were individualized Pokemon icons). The Cyndaquil looked normal, but it was Level 5 with only 1 HP left with only two attacks: “Leer” and “Flash”. I don’t know why they named him “HURRY”, but at the time, I just disregarded it. The most eerie thing was that, despite my volume being at max, none of the Pokemon he had said their usual cries. Just pure silence. Having enough of the team, I closed it. I was parked at what appears to be a room inside Bellsprout Tower. However, for some reason, there were no NPCs around. Even more eerie was that the “pillar” in the middle didn’t move at all, as if just leaning on its side. There was no music at all, and there was no exit or ladder, or least I thought there wasn’t. I walked around for a few minutes but can’t seem to find a way out. This was certainly not a room I’ve seen in the Bellsprout Tower before. I’ve tried checking my items for an Escape Rope, but the bag was completely empty. There wasn’t any Wild Pokemon either. Finally, I’ve managed to find a ladder, which turned out to be behind the “pillar”. The screen turned black and the music finally started playing. I had a sudden chill, as I recognize that melody I heard to be the theme you hear when you listened to the radio at the Alph Ruins where the Unown are at. I immediately realize that it wasn’t a loading transition, but rather I was in a dark room and would need Flash. Before I took care of that though, I immediately checked my Pokegear to change the radio to something more pleasant, but it turns out that there was no Radio card, or even a Phone nor Time cards. There was only a Map card in which Gold (“…” from earlier, and I will call him Gold from now on) was just walking in a midst of black. I recall that Cyndaquil has Flash, so I turned off my Pokegear and made Cyndaquil use Flash. I didn’t see any message saying “HURRY has used Flash!” or anything like that. The room just became lit just like that, and I soon regretted it. The room was a chilling blood-red with a linear gray path heading south. The ladder I used to go up/down was not there at all. I had no choice but to head south. The screen got darker every 20 steps I made, until I finally made it to the end, which appears to be a sign. I read the sign, which said “TURN BACK NOW”. Suddenly, I was asked to answer YES/NO, but there was no question asked. I chose YES as I do not know what it was asking, and the screen went black again, making a “ladder climbed” sound. The Unown Radio music stopped, and in a few seconds was replaced with the not-as-creepy Poke Flute radio music. I was in another dark room, but I held my breath and used Flash again. Suddenly, it said that “HURRY has fainted!” which was odd since I recall that there was no status conditions like Poison on him, and I clearly wasn’t in a battle. I checked my Pokemon quickly and suddenly he’s no longer in my party. In fact, after a bit of investigating, none of my Pokemon are there, but instead all replaced with Level 10 Unown. I did the same thing as before and spelled out the Unown. My then team of Unown spelled “HEDIED”. Either way, after that creepy change, the room was lit to reveal myself in a very small room that appears to be only four squares big. The walls of that room were gray bricks, as if I was inside something that was hollowed out. Outside that room appears to be a bunch of graves similar to the ones in Pokemon Red/Blue. I’ve walked around that small room and pressed A but nothing happened. I’ve already concluded that this was clearly a hacked game and some sadistic fuck sold it to Gamestop. However, my curiosity kept me going. I checked the trainer profile of “…” again only to find out that the sprite of Gold was missing his arms. He also seems to appear less smug, but rather seems more sad and empty in a way that I do not know how to describe. For some reason, it also now said that he has 24 badges, which was clearly impossible. After a few minutes of aimless wondering, my character suddenly spun and did the Escape Rope spinning animation. Instead of flying up though, my character spun downwards slowly, as if sinking. After that screen, the music stopped. After finally landing, the overworld sprite of Gold is coloured differently now. Instead of the usual red colour he dons, he appears completely white now, including his skin. It’s as if he came straight from the colorless Game Boy games placed into a colored background of the Gameboy Color. I checked his profile, and now, while now is as white as his overworld sprite, he lost his legs and has what appears to be bloody tears from his eyes. It also says he now has 32 badges, which now starts to disturb me as this change of number seems to represent something important. I also checked my Pokemon, which this time contains 5 Unowns and a Level 100 Celebi without a nickname. The Unown are this time Leveled 15 and spelled out “DYING”. I checked the Celebi’s profile. It was a shiny Celebi, except there’s only half of the sprite. One leg, one arm, one eye. It only has one attack: “Perish Song”. The area I was in itself was the Sprout Tower with the immobile pillar as before, except everything is apparently red now. I walked north for what felt like forever. Eventually, I finally encountered some generic men and women NPC. They were all lined up to the side just facing the long slantish pillar in the middle. They were also white, and nothing happens when I try to speak to them. I kept on going north until eventually the pillar finally appears chopped off, with a transparent Red in that spot. I went up to Red and without even pressing A, I was suddenly engaged and finally in a battle. The music starts again, which it sounds like the Unown Radio music again, but played backwards. Gold’s battle backsprite matches his front one with the bloody eyes, white skin, and lack of arms, while Red’s sprite was the same as before in GSC except transparent. The text simply said “wants to battle!” as if he has no name, and both of us only have one Pokemon each, which is weird as I swear I had six with the Unowns. My shiny Celebi came out, conveniently with half-a-sprite for the back sprite also. The “Shiny” noise and animation was different, as the sounds it made sound like multiple “Screech” attacks used consecutively. Red sent out a seemingly normal male Pikachu, except he is Level 255 and his sprite seems sad and has tears in his eyes. Rather than the usual “FIGHT/ITEM/PKMN/RUN” menu, I was only given the option to use the Attacks. Since Celebi only has one, I chose it. Naturally, since Pikachu was Level 255, he went first. “PIKACHU used CURSE!”, lowering his Speed and increasing his other Stats. I’m not even sure if Pikachu could even use Curse. “CELEBI used PERISH SONG!” In three turns, both Pokemon get KO’d – not like I have a choice. At this point, it didn’t even go back to the Fight menu, as the battle just continued without me. Also note that there was no animations at all for some reason. “PIKACHU used FLAIL!”, which didn’t do much damage despite his Level and boost as his health was maxed. “CELEBI used Perish Song!” Nothing happens as it was already used. “PIKACHU used FRUSTRATION!”, which did a shitton of damage, knocking Celebi down to less than 10 HP. “CELEBI used Pain Split!”, which surprised me as Celebi didn’t even have that attack in the first place. Now Celebi and Pikachu have about 150 HP. “PIKACHU used MEAN LOOK!” Not like that did anything. As expected, due to the effects of Perish Song, my Celebi fainted. Except in the text, it said “CELEBI has died!” and instead of the ordinary drop off the screen animation, the CELEBI backsprite just vanished. For some reason, the Pikachu was still up even with Perish Song and it didn’t count as my lost. Pikachu used one more different attack beyond the 5 attack limit: “PIKACHU used DESTINY BOND!” Afterwards, it said “PIKACHU has died!”, with a slow fade-out animation. Apparently, I was the winner, as the transparent Red Sprite showed up and said “……….” At that point, I just freaked out, as that transparent Red sprite was suddenly beheaded, leaving nothing but his transparent body. The battle then ended at that point and faded out along with the music. I’m back in the overworld, with another change to the Gold sprite – he’s now as transparent as Red’s overworld sprite. I quickly checked Gold’s profile, where this time the only thing remains of him is his head, with a transparent skin. The head was zoomed in a bit, showing a black void in his eyes. It now stated that he now has 40 badges. I then backed out and checked my Pokemon. They were all Level 20 Shiny Unown, which when spelled out, read “NOMORE”. I was at what I now know is next to the end. There was apparently no music playing, but for some reason I still felt like something was there that could be heard. I was back in my room in New Bark Town. Maybe finally I get to play this game properly, but who am I kidding. I knew that sadistic fuck must have done something. I “walked” around my room to interact with things, as I’m a bit afraid to go down the stairs to see what was awaiting down there. Note I said “walked”, as while the background was moving, Gold was not moving his transparent limbs at all while doing so, just floating like those ghosts you see in Diamond/Pearl. As expected, the radio, computer, and TV did not work, so I had no choice but to go down the stairs. I ended up in the same lower level room of my house. Everything appears normal, except mom isn’t home. After failing to interact with anything in this room, I decided to go outside. To my surprised, that door leading outside at the south didn’t work, and instead I just walk straight through it to a void. I continued moving south to see what the fuck was going on. My house vanishes as I head south into the void. It was creepy as when I entered the void, the outline on Gold’s transparent sprite turned white to contrast with the pitch black. Eventually, I reached a white area and Gold’s sprite turned black and transparent again. I continued south without thinking of stopping at all. After a long trek south, I finally encountered something. It was GOLD’s regular sprite. I talked to it. He said “Good bye forever ….” (notably with a space inbetween the forever and ….), and vanished. As that happened, it said “??? used NIGHTMARE” which at that point, I would not deny that being possible. Gold did another Escape Rope animation spinning slowly downwards like before. I’m now back into that small hollowed-out room surrounded by graves earlier. Or at least I say I was back there, as there’s no sprite anymore. I tried to walk around but nothing moved – not even wall bumping noise. I checked my trainer profile with absolutely no Gold sprite left. It said I have 0 badges and all the pictures of the Johto Gym Leaders at the bottom were replaced with skulls. I checked my Pokemon, which were all Level 25 Unown. As expected, it spelled out a phrase that I dared to read. “IMDEAD” As soon as I went back to the overworld, the room I supposedly was in was then covered with the same blocks as the walls. I then figured out what exactly that room was when the final text was said: “R.I.P. …” That room was a big grave, surrounded by other grave. Gold has already been dead. He died presumably a few years after he defeated Red. He was a young trainer who, despite his efforts in collecting so many badges and attempts at becoming a Pokemon master, was still unable to avoid the inevitable fate of death, and his efforts were eventually forgotten by the next generation. I was unable to escape from that text no matter what I pressed. I tried resetting the game, and the same thing happened, at which I then finally decided to give up on that horrible nightmare. After that experience, I will never look at the “gimmick” Unown the same way again. They say that only the first generation have folk tales and legends, but the second generation have shown me how unpleasant the truth can be. I eventually enjoyed SoulSilver immensely, but I still can’t unthink what that rigged game have told me.       The precise origin of the very first "Bob" character remains unclear, but the earliest known instances of the copypasta began appearing in YouTube comments sometime between June 2008 and April 2009, according to Google Trends and numerous forum discussions about the spam.    The song debuted on the sketch comedy television show Saturday Night Live as a digital short on February 7th, 2009. On June 16th, it was uploaded to the LonelyIslandVevo YouTube channel (shown below), where it received over 24.7 million views and 17,500 comments over the next four years. The video parodied clichés often found in rap music videos, including "Big Pimpin'" by rapper Jay-Z. According to Urban Dictionary, it is defined as: "To shake the face violently from side to side for the purpose of humour. This moment is performed for the camera to break up the monotony of the scenic photos. It can be classed as pure genius entertainment."    "LOL NO YOU DONT YOU IDORT" In October 26, 2009, a Youtube user called chuckeepooper has posted a video called RAEP FAIC, with the face of the Demoman from TF2: This is the official fad starter, bringing it 142 responses (2010). The source of "Oh NOES" is not really known, but there is proof that the term was written over Urban Dictionary in the year 2003 and there are rumors that the phrase was written in 2000, 2001, 2002 or even 1999, but as known today there are no evidence of this at all, and even if it was written in these years, the forum was either deleted or the post was deleted, but the live evidence was mainly in Urban Dictionary. The live evidence known to the internet that most people think that the origin of this term is by JeffK, a username on a Usenet, posting the following: In the 1990's, the University's computer laboratory was a large seven-story building which housed approximately fifteen academics. There was only one coffeepot among them in the Trojan Room corridor and for some of the faculty members, getting coffee or refills involved a long trek across the campus buildings. In 1991, Quentin Stafford-Fraser and Paul Jardetzky, members of the "coffee club," used a functional video frame-grabber and a server program to capture the side profile of the coffeepot every few seconds. Stafford-Fraser subsequently built a client application for users to run on their remote computers, which displayed a 128×128 grayscale image of the coffee pot that was updated about three times a minute, according to the official homepage of Trojan Room Coffee Pot. Called "XCoffee," the live feed was launched in 1999 and originally ran over Multi-Service Network Layer (MSNL) using a video capture board on an Acorn Archimedes computer.[2] When web browsers gained the ability to display images in March 1993, it was clear this would be an easier way to make the picture available. That November, the service officially moved to a website[3] built by Daniel Gordon and Martyn Johnson[4] and became the first live stream to broadcast online.  In 1993, The California Milk Processor Board launched the “Got Milk?” advertisement campaign as a way to encourage public consumption of cow’s milk. Working with the ad agency Goodby, Silverstein & Partners[1], the first commercial for the campaign aired on October 29th, 1993, featuring a man sitting in a room that appears to be a shrine to the historical duel between Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr.[2] In the commercial, the man calls in to a radio station’s trivia contest for a $10,000 prize, but he fails to utter his response with his mouth full of peanut butter sandwhich. Directed by Michael Bay, the commercial went on to win a 1994 Silver Lion award at the Cannes International Advertising Festival, a Gold award at the 1994 CLIO Awards, and was inducted into the CLIOAdvertising Hall of Fame in 2009.[3] Following the campaign's successful reception, the National Milk Processor Board[4] licensed the slogan for their print ads, pairing the phrase with celebrity portraits of actors, musicians, athletes and fictional characters with a milk mustache. Since its launch in 1995, hundreds of these ads have been published; a collection of 300 "Got Milk?" posters is currently hosted at Creative Criminals.[5] As of May 2012, the campaign continues to remain active on Facebook and Twitter, both under the tagline “Got Milk?”[6][7] and “Milk Mustache Campaign.”[8][9]  Zoolander is a 2001 comedy film written, directed and starring Ben Stiller. In it he plays Derek Zoolander, an American male model brainwashed to kill the Prime Minister of Malaysia. The phrase "I feel like I'm taking crazy pills" occurs when the fashion designer 'Jacobim Mugatu', played by Will Ferrell finally expresses his frustration at the fact no one else in the fashion world has noticed Derek Zoolander's supposedly career defining runway 'looks' are nothing more than him pulling the same face over and over again.  In Portal you are required to do numerous tasks in a research facility guided by a computer named GlaDOS, who repeatedly mentions that following the experiment, there will be cake. As the game progresses, the player finds messages written on the walls as warnings from Doug Rattmann, an old lab worker who has been featured on the Lab Rat[7] comic series. One message scrawled on the walls in later levels reads "the cake is a lie. the cake is a lie. the cake is a lie. the cake is a lie": It is later revealed in the game, that in order to keep the AI GlaDOS from killing everyone, she is fitted with an AI "personality core" that continuously list off the directions and ingredients needed for baking a cake. In addition, the ending credits sequence that follows the game features a song called, "Still Alive" which mentions the cake and features a sole cake at the bottom of the test facility. This cake is a virtualized cartoon version of a Black Forest cake that was sold near Valve Headquarters.   One of the earliest known instances of the phrase "prepare your anus" was posted by Team XBox Forums[1] member tenaciousdave as the title of a thread containing a news story speculating that humans will encounter aliens within two decades. The earliest known image macro including the phrase was submitted to the Internet humor site FunnyJunk[3] by user RussianPerson on October 21st, 2009, which featured a screenshot of a CGI chipmunk from the 2007 comedy film Alvin and the Chipmunks (shown below). Since the on-air debut of Man vs. Wild in 2006, the series has grown into an internationally distributed cable show with over 1.2 billion viewers. According to the show's Wikipedia[1] entry, Grylls has climbed cliffs, parachuted from a variety of aircraft, ran through a forest fire, ate snakes and utilized a sheep corpse as a flotation device. Grylls has also been known to drink his own urine to prevent dehydration, which he demonstrated in Episode 13: Kimberley, Australia: "If I had just peed on the ground, that's all those fluids wasted." On September 7th, 2010, Redditor Faneste123 submitted a post titled “The Sun Is Going Down”[2], which included a Bear Grylls image macro with the caption “The sun is going down / better drink my own piss" in reference to his demonstration of urine-drinking in the episode. The post reached the front page of the /r/pics subreddit, receiving over 2,313 up votes prior to being archived.      Carlton's first appearance in the show was on pilot, released in September 10, 1990, he comes up as sophisticated, and although highly intelligent, also arrogant, which challenged Will Smith's views. One of the first images related to the photoshop meme dates back to the early 90's during the first seasons of the show. RAER SELDAS is an internet meme created around a member of the Zelda series fansite, Zelda Dungeon. DARK MASTER was a member of the community notorious for his spam-like posting and very poor grammar. He was noted for posting about Rare Zeldas and posting things related to it in all capital letters. Zelda Dungeon's Skype chat warped the phrase to RAER SELDAS due to his capital letters and poor grammar.  "The Little Sprite" was written by a Japanese composer Hiroki Kikuta.[2]. And its original title "The Child of the Sprite Tribe" is a homage to an anthology of short stories by Lord Dunsany[3], which includes his 1924 fantasy novel "The King of Elfland's Daughter" translated as "The Daughter of the Sprite Tribe" in the Japanese edition. However, this song is a theme music not for POPOI who is one of the player characters and the child of the sprite tribe, but for KAKKARA which is a village in the desert (shown below, left). The oldest video using this song for parody was a simple remix with the dance of I Want To Love You Tender, which was posted to NND in May 13th, 2008[4]. This song became to increase its popularity in MADs around March 2009. Some of the earliest videos that received support from MAD editors featured Lucky Star[5] and Tsukuyomi: Moon Phase.[6] Among these, several videos featuring the characters from K-ON! like this (shown below, right) succeeded to reach the largest audience partly due to the huge popularity of the anime in those days. The phrase originates from a scene in the Star Trek: Deep Space 9 episode titled "In the Pale Moonlight", which first aired on April 15, 1998. In the scene, Vreenak (played by Stephen McHattie) summons and confronts Captain Sisko (played by Avery Brooks) for handing him a forged optolythic data rod, before uttering the iconic line in a strange, hissy voice: Shortly after its broadcast in 1998, the memorable quote soon became adopted as a common text response to Trek-related posts on Usenet.[1] The phrase continued to live on as a form of copypasta on Usenet as well as Star Trek forums and chatrooms for years, as documented in a Usenet thread archived in October 2000.[2] In February 2010, a mysterious billboard appeared along I-35 near Wyoming, Minn. It showed former President George W. Bush smirking and waving along with the caption "Miss me yet?" This was assumed to be an expression of dissatisfaction concerning the performance of current President Barack Obama. No one seemed to know who was responsible. Some details were revealed in a Feb 9, 2010 story on npr.com: Since then, occasional variations have sprung forth on the Internet that show a different image photoshopped onto the billboard, or an entirely different image altogether. Usually the caption "Miss me yet?" is included, although some variants exist.   The videos were made between the 1st and 8th of January 2010 on the St. Kusocińskiego, Szczecin street of Northwest Poland. The most popular mirror of the video was uploaded by PyskatyYT, featuring the first video and has been viewed over 750,000 times. However, the oldest versions still on YouTube of the videos were uploaded by user Kovibanana, all of which reached over 400,000 views. The true original video, however, has been removed due to terms of violation. First video: Second video: Third video: The first video shows cars are trying to climb an ice covered street, but failing to gain control, and eventually colliding with the the taxi standing at the side of the street. The taxi's door is damaged and the mirror is torn off. During the video, one of the spectators says "Ale urwał, – Ale to było dobre" (Engish: "Look how he torn it off, – that was so good!"). The characteristic voice and intonation of the spectator as he says "Ale urwał" and the similarity between the words, "urwał" (English: tear) and "kurwa" (the Polish equivalent of "F*ck" or "Sh*t" as an interjection, but literally translated to "whore") made it instantly popular among the Polish internet community. Other catchphrases from this video have also crossed over into the Polish language in the internet web and in regular speech. Conspiracy Theory: There is a theory that says the driver of the taxi intentionally stopped at the place that he did, where there was no parking allowed. The taxi driver who was hit was said to have parked there to swindle insurance. The video was apparently filmed as evidence for an insurance company. Further evidence is provided by him saying "Ale Urwał!" (English: "Look how he broke it off!") in an excited voice. In the 1990s, an America Online (AOL) chatroom titled "Ask Me Anything" existed for members of the internet service to interact and ask each other questions. As the room was placed in the Romance category, the room was typically intended for questions of a sexual nature. In May 1995, several female frequenters of the chatroom left and formed "Ask Female Anything" in the general chat category, which was known as "Town Square," allowing any type of question that related to women.[1] Frequently Asked Questions[2] from the chatroom were archived on a Tripod homepage. The Your Life template first appeared on the /b/ board of 4chan in late 2009/early 2010, based upon the avatar of the then popular Draw Yourself (a.k.a "Post Your Avatar") threads on the website: The template took the idea of the ‘Post Your Avatar’ threads but took it to a whole new level; that of detailing one’s everyday wants, activities, and habits. But although it contained much more than the exploitable it was based upon, it touched on such daily things that it was easily mimicked and repeated.                 In the anime series Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, the character Kamina, known for his manliness, wears a pair of red-tinted triangular glasses, which naturally became known as "Kamina glasses," although he is not the first character to use the style of shades (character shown below). It's unknown when exactly web users began photoshopping Kamina's glasses onto other characters for comedic effect. The practice likely began in an anime forum about the show sometime in 2007. On August 23rd, 2007, Deviant Art[5] user T4R0K uploaded a piece of fan art showing the character Saber from the visual novel Fate/stay night with Kamina glasses, garnering over 1,000 views in 14 years (shown below). On August 31, 2010 in a thread about Sarah Palin, the trolls were at it again, so fed up one farker posted a picture of a taco. The tacos in comments and pictures started popping up as the trolls kept trolling. New memes were being made, some of which incorporated both Sarah Palin and tacos, some referring to her vagina as a taco, as well as one which called out a specific user, which many FARK LibTards consider the King of the FARK ReTarded Trolls. A FARK Moderator deleted the entirety of the taco memes, even the Palin incorporated ones. The thread went ablaze with fiery dissent over the removal. The Moderator that deleted the content engaged the angry Farkers and their pitchforks, explaining that threadjacking and calling specific users out by user name is prohibited.    The original horse head mask was manufactured by the Seattle-based novelty dealer Archie McPhee & Co.[1] and made available for sale through websites as early as February 1st, 2002.[2] The concept of wearing a horse head mask for purposes other than as a Halloween costume can be found in the The Lonely Planet Guide to Experimental Travel published on June 29th, 2005.[4] In the book, one of the social experiments called "Horse Head Adventure"[5] suggested one of the travelers to wear a horse mask while the group were touring places on vacation. Due to the anonymous nature of Chatroulette and Omegle, people are inclined to do more than they normally would on a website, which includes both trolling and freedom of actions, which creates a perfect environment for trolling and screen capping (often to the embarrassment of the trolled). In the review (which originally aired on September 17th, 2008), the Critic proceeds to have a mental breakdown after seeing Batman (played by George Clooney) flashing a "Bat Credit Card" after he and Robin (played by Chris O'Donell) are hypnotized by Poison Ivy (played by Uma Thurman) and start bidding on her. The scene begins at the 8:10 mark. The term "Pertamax" was believed to be coined by Ilham, owner of the now defunct KafeMotor, a popular blog site that focuses on motorcycles. The term was used on the site as early as 2007[2]. The usage of the phrase begun on 7chan's now defunct invasion board, otherwise known as /i/. Noticing the success rate of /i/, people often sought for help from this board for their personal problems and vendettas. As these issues do not usually matter to anybody else on the board, the phrase was often used as a reply to the original poster to signify that the board doesn't want to help.      On July 3rd, 2009, Andrew Hussie uploaded the first Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff comic to the MS Paint Adventures[5] website. In the comic, the bearded character Sweet Bro falls down a flight of stairs while carrying a stack of video games. During the course of his fall, Hella Jeff responds "I warned you about stairs bro! I told you dog!"   On November 3rd, 2004, the day following the 2004 US Presidential election, G. Webb posted the map in a thread titled "I've solved it! – Now the Jesusland watch thread" on YakYak forum[1], a message board for fans of video game designer Jeff Minter.[12] The map was an attempt to explain why George W. Bush had won the presidency. Changing the subject topic in an online discussion has been in practice since the early days of mailing lists and newsgroups. According to search results, the earliest mention of "threadjacking" can be found in a game-related discussion thread posted via Civilization fan forum[1] in October 2001; the earliest attempt at "threadjacking" on record can be found in an off-topic thread posted via Team XBOX forums[2] in April 2002. The Urban Dictionar[3] entry for "threadjacking" was created on December 11th, 2003.  The phrase is said during the final battle in the live action movie, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (the sequel to the first live action movie), which was directed by Michael Bay. In the movie, Optimus Prime is portrayed as somewhat aggressive (as shown in the video above). Because of this, movie Optimus Prime is sometimes parodied as bloodthirsty (usually wanting your face), and is then accompanied with the phrase, "Give me your face". Before it became paired with "durr," the word "hurr" appeared alone on sites like the Something Awful forums where it was used in similar vein to the sarcastic laughter “har har”[3] in responding to a dumb joke. This usage of "hurr" has been noted as early as March 27th, 2003 in a Something Awful thread[5] about 1970's adult films. Hurr was first defined on Urban Dictionary[4] as a caricature of "a dumb sounding laugh" on June 28th, 2003. By July 2006[6], hurr had been implemented as an emoticon[7] on the site. One of the earliest archived mentions of "hurr durr" also took place on the Something Awful Forums. On August 17th, 2007, the phrase appeared as commentary[1] on dialogue used in the dating sim game Sakura Wars: Atsuki Chishio ni[2] in a Let's Play thread. Written and performed by Yuusuke[1] ,"Mitsubachi" was released in Japan as the second single for his second album "Well.. I Wish I Could Dream" on July 28th, 2010.[2] The Caribbean SOCA[3] inspired song is notable for it's main hook melody, which is a sample of the Japanese children song "Bun bun bun" (ぶんぶんぶん), with "bun" (ぶん/ブン) being an onomatopoeia for the sound bees make when they flap their wings. The song became one of the top singles in Japan during the summer of 2010, peaking at number two on the Oricon music chart on August 9th.[4] However, despite it's chart success, the song quickly became a subject of criticism and mockery in Japan. Many scrutinized its nonsensical lyrics and its repetitiveness, while some condemned it for its excessive use of a children's melody for a song containing "suggestive undertones". Much of the distaste for the song also comes from the disdain towards the singer himself with many questioning his authenticity and seeing him as being pushed by his record label. The original picture was taken on set during filming of the 2010 science fiction movie Inception. On August 19th, 2009, the entertainment blog Celebrity-Gossip[14] published a post titled "Leonardo DiCaprio and Ellen Page: Filming in Paris", which featured the strutting image in an Inception photo gallery. Fansubbed anime (and by extension, failsubs) began surfacing in the Western world in the 1980's, when anime was starting to boom. Enthusiasts with some proficiency in the Japanese language began to subtitle anime that hadn't been subbed officially yet so that they could share them with non-Japanese speaking fans.[1][2] These fansubs were done mostly on VHS/Betamax, were terribly expensive to produce, and were of notoriously low quality. According to Rational Wiki[1], Jennings received a flu shot on August 23rd, 2009 and developed flu-like symptoms shortly after. On September 7th, she visited a hospital claiming she was suffering from fainting spells and convulsions but no doctors could find any evidence of a serious illness. Soon after, Jennings began complaining that she would move erratically if she were not running or walking backwards. Her physical therapist diagnosed her with dystonia, a neurological disorder which causes body jerks or repetitive movements due to muscle contractions. On October 16th, the television news program Inside Edition aired a report about Jennings, featuring footage of Jennings performing spasms and talking with a speech impediment. As of July 16th, 2012, the original upload had accumulated over 1.3 million views but has since been removed.     The earliest known instance of the copypasta tweet was posted by Twitter user JBtoColorado[1] on August 18th, 2010: .bbpBox21551372695 {background:url(http://a2.twimg.com/profile_background_images/237871416/background_8.jpg) #ffffff;padding:20px;} p.bbpTweet{background:#fff;padding:10px 12px 10px 12px;margin:0;min-height:48px;color:#000;font-size:18px !important;line-height:22px;-moz-border-radius:5px;-webkit-border-radius:5px} p.bbpTweet span.metadata{display:block;width:100%;clear:both;margin-top:8px;padding-top:12px;height:40px;border-top:1px solid #fff;border-top:1px solid #e6e6e6} p.bbpTweet span.metadata span.author{line-height:19px} p.bbpTweet span.metadata span.author img{float:left;margin:0 7px 0 0px;width:38px;height:38px} p.bbpTweet a:hover{text-decoration:underline}p.bbpTweet span.timestamp{font-size:12px;display:block} sometimes I want to just copy someone else's tweet word for word just to see if they would notice…less than a minute ago via web Favorite Retweet ReplyKeren ✔ ß℮ℓїℯßℯґ ♡ ♫JBtoColorado  The original photograph of Cera was taken by film director Edgar Wright while the two were in Norway to promote the 2010 action comedy film Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. On August 23rd, 2010, Wright uploaded the photo to his Flickr[1] page, which received over 26,000 views within two years. At nearly the same time, a very similar photoshop meme referred to as "Strutting Leo" photoshop meme, involving an exploitable photograph of actor Leonardo DiCaprio, began spreading online. Originates from the opening cutscene in the Nintendo Wii game, Kirby's Epic Yarn, during which Kirby gets sucked into the mysterious patchland by the evil sorcerer yin-yarn. As soon as he enters, he muses about how the grass mysteriously feels like pants. Making this funny is the fact that Kirby does not and never has worn pants, making the quote somewhat pointless.   The first use of "Jumping Is not a crime", dates back to May 2006, with a video by VideoPunk, with the claim that "Base jumping is not illegal thus "not a crime": The first use of "Jumping is not a crime" by the jumpstyle community dates back to May 2006, when YouTube user guerrillas, uploaded a video of himself jumpstyling, with the video titled "Jumping is not a crime": The illustration is rumored to have originated on the imageboard 4chan, but no archived thread has been found. The earliest known instance of the face was posted on the Russian Internet humor website Joy Reactor[1] on June 24th, 2009. The phrase "For the Win" was been in usage since prior 2005. However, "Epic Win" has only begun trending by mid-2007. The earliest entries for the terms in Urban Dictionary are on March 25, 2003 by Früchlè[2], April 29, 2007 by Jamal-Mufasa Cosby[3], and May 12, 2005 by kuchen[4] for Win, Epic Win, and For the Win, respectively. The term Jumpstyle[5] was coined in the late 1990s to describe an emerging genre of music infusing two styles of electronica: Hardstyle[6], known for its use of kick drums, faded basslines and melodic synth, and Gabber[7], a house music[8] variant notable for distorted bass drums and sampled melodies. This genre[10] was given its name by Belgian dance music duo Da Boy Tommy and Da Rick[9], who became known for their Jumpstyle songs. The dance that became associated with Jumpstyle music is believed to have evolved from the moves people make while skiing.[1]    The term Telisplat (originally capitalized as TEliSPlaT) is a loose acronym of "Triple Elimination Six (or Seven) Player Tournament". Originally, Telisplat was simply a tournament format that could be used for a handful of friend to compete in a given video game. While any video game could technically be used, it was more geared toward sports games. In a typical Telisplat evening, a group of friends would settle into a dorm room with copious amounts of alcohol, hook up a video game system through a VCR or other device to record the video while patching in microphones via a mixing board, and proceed to play through a tournament while taking turns acting as sports announcers for the action. Telisplat eventually lost its meaning as a tournament system and took on the new definition of drunken gaming and amateur announcing, naturally recorded for posterity and additionally so the participants could gain a third-person perspective of their inebriated behavior.      During Microsoft's E3 2009 Press conference they showed a full body scanning peripheral called Project Natal (Now known as Kinect) Kudo tsunoda was doing a demonstration on how Kinect tracks your body. However the on-screen avatar was glitched. Kudo then provided the line "You ever wonder what the bottom of an avatar's shoe looks like? Wabam! There it is" Kudo's avatar then rather then provide what Kudo looked like glitched so Kudo's arms and legs twisted. The pixel art for the "Move Your Feet" music video[1] was originally drawn by art collective Shynola[2] using its signature style of low-resolution pixel art with the bitmap graphics editor Deluxe Paint.[3] The song was recorded sometime in 2002 and the earliest known instance of the music video available for download was featured in a blog article[4] posted on August 5th, 2002. Upon its commercial release in 2003, the song became Junior Senior's biggest hit, reaching #3 in the United Kingdom and #20 in Australia, and played at dance clubs all over the world. The song was also featured in numerous promotional clips for various TV programs, such as the Australian version of "So You Think You Can Dance," as well as comedy films like White Chicks and Forgetting Sarah Marshall among others. The game was also incorporated into the dance arcade games Dance Dance Revolution and Phineas and Ferb. Forever Alone is considered one of the first major rage comic spin-off characters to be creater after the original Rage Guy, which first sprang up on 4chan in 2009. According to various sources, the original comic was uploaded in a thread titled "April Fools" by FunnyJunk user Azuul on May 28th, 2010 (shown below). While the original artist has not been confirmed, Dictionary.com[24] cites Dominic Vanner as the illustrator behind the character.    The Tunnel Snakes are a group of teenagers/children in the 2008 video game Fallout 3 made by Bethesda Softworks[1]. In the early levels where the player plays as a teenager in Vault 101, they meet the group, at the end of the characters sentences they will exclaim "Tunnel Snakes Rule!" They are characterized in the game by wearing black leather jackets with their logo on the back, slicked back hair, and wise-guy attitude (similar to the 50's idea of a Greaser). Though there are only three members of the "gang" each one is proud of the fact that they are The Tunnel Snakes. On August 31st, 2009, YouTuber Elevated Level posted a remix of Fallout 3 character Butch DeLoria, leader of the Tunnel Snakes, saying "Tunnel Snakes Rule!" The video gained over 2.6 million views (shown below).   The Phrase originated in chapter 280 of the manga which was released on October 31st, 2005. The phrase was uttered by Zetsu during Tobi's introduction. Tobi: Will this be enough for me to join the Akatsuki? Zetsu (black): Fool…It’s not that easy… Zetsu (white): Why not…? Let him join…Tobi is a good boy… Airing from 1990 to 1996 on NBC, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air starred the then rapper Will Smith as a fictional version of himself who is made to move to Bel Air after getting in "one little fight", scaring his mom. The famous theme song written by Will Smith himself and QD3, recounts the backstory behind the series in musical form, and is also a popular subject for bait and switch copypastas. On October 10th, 2006, "Fresh Prince of The Death Star" was uploaded to YTMND by State-of-mind[1]. Featuring a mash up of "The Imperial March" by John Williams from the Star Wars series and Smith's vocals from the Fresh Prince theme song, the site essentially set the standard for other mashup YTMNDs that followed afterwards.   On August 16th, 2010, Florida based musician and producer Nick Pittsinger a posted a link to the /r/music subreddit[1] that contained a version of Justin Bieber's "U Smile" that had been slowed down 800%. Although the original SoundCloud link has now been taken down, dozens of copy-cat examples can still be found on YouTube.           The perpetrators in the video have been dubbed as the Dnepropetrovsk maniacs. The trio are serial killers who are guilty of at least 20 murders. Run the Gauntlet,[4] a shock site that gets progressively gorier as the user chooses, is the first link to appear when searched on Google. Although the video in Run the Gauntlet is watermarked to the gore news site, Best Gore. The victim in this video was identified as Sergei Yatzenko, a 48-year-old male who had recently been forced into retirement due to a cancerous tumor in his throat.  One of the first Youtube users to take advantage of this in his videos was RubberFruit[1], most of whose videos involve surrealist events.       "I CAN THE POWER!!"'s origin seems to be in a grammar error in a thread of the popular website "FunnyJunk.com", most likely in the NSFW section, do to the original threads context. This is probably a unintentionally hilarious result of poor English: “100 nsfw uploads. I can the power returning already>:D” On August 8th, 2009, the Rip747 Wordpress[12] blog posted the "Russian Sleep Experiment" story, claiming to have received the creepypasta in an email from his brother. The story describes an experiment performed on five Russian prison inmates who are exposed to an experimental stimulant gas that keeps them from falling asleep with the promise that they would be set free if they remain awake for 30 days. Russian researchers in the late 1940s kept five people awake for fifteen days using an experimental gas based stimulant. They were kept in a sealed environment to carefully monitor their oxygen intake so the gas didn't kill them, since it was toxic in high concentrations. This was before closed circuit cameras so they had only microphones and 5 inch thick glass porthole sized windows into the chamber to monitor them. The chamber was stocked with books, cots to sleep on but no bedding, running water and toilet, and enough dried food to last all five for over a month. The test subjects were political prisoners deemed enemies of the state during World War II. Everything was fine for the first five days; the subjects hardly complained having been promised (falsely) that they would be freed if they submitted to the test and did not sleep for 30 days. Their conversations and activities were monitored and it was noted that they continued to talk about increasingly traumatic incidents in their past, and the general tone of their conversations took on a darker aspect after the 4 day mark. After five days they started to complain about the circumstances and events that lead them to where they were and started to demonstrate severe paranoia. They stopped talking to each other and began alternately whispering to the microphones and one way mirrored portholes. Oddly they all seemed to think they could win the trust of the experimenters by turning over their comrades, the other subjects in captivity with them. At first the researchers suspected this was an effect of the gas itself… After nine days the first of them started screaming. He ran the length of the chamber repeatedly yelling at the top of his lungs for 3 hours straight, he continued attempting to scream but was only able to produce occasional squeaks. The researchers postulated that he had physically torn his vocal cords. The most surprising thing about this behavior is how the other captives reacted to it… or rather didn't react to it. They continued whispering to the microphones until the second of the captives started to scream. The 2 non-screaming captives took the books apart, smeared page after page with their own feces and pasted them calmly over the glass portholes. The screaming promptly stopped. So did the whispering to the microphones. After 3 more days passed. The researchers checked the microphones hourly to make sure they were working, since they thought it impossible that no sound could be coming with 5 people inside. The oxygen consumption in the chamber indicated that all 5 must still be alive. In fact it was the amount of oxygen 5 people would consume at a very heavy level of strenuous exercise. On the morning of the 14th day the researchers did something they said they would not do to get a reaction from the captives, they used the intercom inside the chamber, hoping to provoke any response from the captives they were afraid were either dead or vegetables. They announced: "We are opening the chamber to test the microphones; step away from the door and lie flat on the floor or you will be shot. Compliance will earn one of you your immediate freedom." To their surprise they heard a single phrase in a calm voice response: "We no longer want to be freed." Debate broke out among the researchers and the military forces funding the research. Unable to provoke any more response using the intercom it was finally decided to open the chamber at midnight on the fifteenth day. The chamber was flushed of the stimulant gas and filled with fresh air and immediately voices from the microphones began to object. 3 different voices began begging, as if pleading for the life of loved ones to turn the gas back on. The chamber was opened and soldiers sent in to retrieve the test subjects. They began to scream louder than ever, and so did the soldiers when they saw what was inside. Four of the five subjects were still alive, although no one could rightly call the state that any of them in 'life.' The food rations past day 5 had not been so much as touched. There were chunks of meat from the dead test subject's thighs and chest stuffed into the drain in the center of the chamber, blocking the drain and allowing 4 inches of water to accumulate on the floor. Precisely how much of the water on the floor was actually blood was never determined. All four 'surviving' test subjects also had large portions of muscle and skin torn away from their bodies. The destruction of flesh and exposed bone on their finger tips indicated that the wounds were inflicted by hand, not with teeth as the researchers initially thought. Closer examination of the position and angles of the wounds indicated that most if not all of them were self-inflicted. The abdominal organs below the ribcage of all four test subjects had been removed. While the heart, lungs and diaphragm remained in place, the skin and most of the muscles attached to the ribs had been ripped off, exposing the lungs through the ribcage. All the blood vessels and organs remained intact, they had just been taken out and laid on the floor, fanning out around the eviscerated but still living bodies of the subjects. The digestive tract of all four could be seen to be working, digesting food. It quickly became apparent that what they were digesting was their own flesh that they had ripped off and eaten over the course of days. Most of the soldiers were Russian special operatives at the facility, but still many refused to return to the chamber to remove the test subjects. They continued to scream to be left in the chamber and alternately begged and demanded that the gas be turned back on, lest they fall asleep… To everyone's surprise the test subjects put up a fierce fight in the process of being removed from the chamber. One of the Russian soldiers died from having his throat ripped out, another was gravely injured by having his testicles ripped off and an artery in his leg severed by one of the subject's teeth. Another 5 of the soldiers lost their lives if you count ones that committed suicide in the weeks following the incident. In the struggle one of the four living subjects had his spleen ruptured and he bled out almost immediately. The medical researchers attempted to sedate him but this proved impossible. He was injected with more than ten times the human dose of a morphine derivative and still fought like a cornered animal, breaking the ribs and arm of one doctor. When heart was seen to beat for a full two minutes after he had bled out to the point there was more air in his vascular system than blood. Even after it stopped he continued to scream and flail for another 3 minutes, struggling to attack anyone in reach and just repeating the word "MORE" over and over, weaker and weaker, until he finally fell silent. The surviving three test subjects were heavily restrained and moved to a medical facility, the two with intact vocal cords continuously begging for the gas demanding to be kept awake… The most injured of the three was taken to the only surgical operating room that the facility had. In the process of preparing the subject to have his organs placed back within his body it was found that he was effectively immune to the sedative they had given him to prepare him for the surgery. He fought furiously against his restraints when the anesthetic gas was brought out to put him under. He managed to tear most of the way through a 4 inch wide leather strap on one wrist, even through the weight of a 200 pound soldier holding that wrist as well. It took only a little more anesthetic than normal to put him under, and the instant his eyelids fluttered and closed, his heart stopped. In the autopsy of the test subject that died on the operating table it was found that his blood had triple the normal level of oxygen. His muscles that were still attached to his skeleton were badly torn and he had broken 9 bones in his struggle to not be subdued. Most of them were from the force his own muscles had exerted on them. The second survivor had been the first of the group of five to start screaming. His vocal cords destroyed he was unable to beg or object to surgery, and he only reacted by shaking his head violently in disapproval when the anesthetic gas was brought near him. He shook his head yes when someone suggested, reluctantly, they try the surgery without anesthetic, and did not react for the entire 6 hour procedure of replacing his abdominal organs and attempting to cover them with what remained of his skin. The surgeon presiding stated repeatedly that it should be medically possible for the patient to still be alive. One terrified nurse assisting the surgery stated that she had seen the patients mouth curl into a smile several times, whenever his eyes met hers. When the surgery ended the subject looked at the surgeon and began to wheeze loudly, attempting to talk while struggling. Assuming this must be something of drastic importance the surgeon had a pen and pad fetched so the patient could write his message. It was simple. "Keep cutting." The other two test subjects were given the same surgery, both without anesthetic as well. Although they had to be injected with a paralytic for the duration of the operation. The surgeon found it impossible to perform the operation while the patients laughed continuously. Once paralyzed the subjects could only follow the attending researchers with their eyes. The paralytic cleared their system in an abnormally short period of time and they were soon trying to escape their bonds. The moment they could speak they were again asking for the stimulant gas. The researchers tried asking why they had injured themselves, why they had ripped out their own guts and why they wanted to be given the gas again. Only one response was given: "I must remain awake." All three subject's restraints were reinforced and they were placed back into the chamber awaiting determination as to what should be done with them. The researchers, facing the wrath of their military 'benefactors' for having failed the stated goals of their project considered euthanizing the surviving subjects. The commanding officer, an ex-KGB instead saw potential, and wanted to see what would happen if they were put back on the gas. The researchers strongly objected, but were overruled. In preparation for being sealed in the chamber again the subjects were connected to an EEG monitor and had their restraints padded for long term confinement. To everyone's surprise all three stopped struggling the moment it was let slip that they were going back on the gas. It was obvious that at this point all three were putting up a great struggle to stay awake. One of subjects that could speak was humming loudly and continuously; the mute subject was straining his legs against the leather bonds with all his might, first left, then right, then left again for something to focus on. The remaining subject was holding his head off his pillow and blinking rapidly. Having been the first to be wired for EEG most of the researchers were monitoring his brain waves in surprise. They were normal most of the time but sometimes flat lined inexplicably. It looked as if he were repeatedly suffering brain death, before returning to normal. As they focused on paper scrolling out of the brainwave monitor only one nurse saw his eyes slip shut at the same moment his head hit the pillow. His brainwaves immediately changed to that of deep sleep, then flatlined for the last time as his heart simultaneously stopped. The only remaining subject that could speak started screaming to be sealed in now. His brainwaves showed the same flatlines as one who had just died from falling asleep. The commander gave the order to seal the chamber with both subjects inside, as well as 3 researchers. One of the named three immediately drew his gun and shot the commander point blank between the eyes, then turned the gun on the mute subject and blew his brains out as well. He pointed his gun at the remaining subject, still restrained to a bed as the remaining members of the medical and research team fled the room. "I won't be locked in here with these things! Not with you!" he screamed at the man strapped to the table. "WHAT ARE YOU?" he demanded. "I must know!" The subject smiled. "Have you forgotten so easily?" The subject asked. "We are you. We are the madness that lurks within you all, begging to be free at every moment in your deepest animal mind. We are what you hide from in your beds every night. We are what you sedate into silence and paralysis when you go to the nocturnal haven where we cannot tread." The researcher paused. Then aimed at the subject's heart and fired. The EEG flatlined as the subject weakly choked out, "So… nearly… free…"  You probably thought that Twitter was using designs they paid for, right? Well, apparently that was not the case. The designer behind the Fail Whale, Yiying Lu, had posted the image to the stock photo web site, iStockPhoto. (She has now removed the original link). Although the image of the Fail Whale was widely known, the designer herself was not. Tom Limongello decided to change that. The name "Figwit" was first conceived in early 2002, when an Israeli college student named Iris Hadad noticed McKenzie in the background of the Council of Elrond scene. She described him as “perfect, pouty and gorgeous” and dubbed him Figwit, a made-up acronym for "Frodo Is Grea… Who Is THAT?!" which is meant to convey the swoons of viewers upon seeing his face in the film. When Frodo says "I will take it!", we are so impressed we start to think “Frodo is great!" But before we finish, the camera pans and we see Figwit, smoldering enigmatically in the background. All other thoughts are whisked away by that elf – who is THAT?! He's gorgeous! In March 2002, Hadad and her friend Sherry de Andres launched the fan site FigwitLives[1] for McKenzie's character, which featured a variety of fanart and songs about the mysterious elf character. "I'm A Stealth Clown" is a phrase coined by Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2's creative strategist and "community manager", Robert Bowling. The phrase refers to a tactic in the multiplayer where you stand behind a fake clown and shoot people from an angle in which they can't see you, thus the term "Stealth Clown". The first and only time he said this was during an interview about Modern Warfare 2's Resurgence map pack, released in July, 2010. Go to 3:52 in the video. "Without even realizing, I went up and I posted up to the first cover point and I'm picking guys off and they're running by and I'm picking them off, and I'm like 'How are these guys not seeing me?' And I realized as I'm fighting that I'm standing in front of a clown, that it's supposed to be the 'You have to be this high to ride there' but my head just happened to be where the clown's head should be, so I'm using that as perfect cover. And so their sight lines, they're running through and they're like 'Oh it's just a clown, it's fine' but I have my gun posted up there on his hand, like just picking guys off and I love that because it was a perfect moment of like, they have no clue I'm even here, I'm, I'm a stealth clown." ~ Robert Bowling   Keyboard function keys date back to the 1960s but did not necessarily have standardized usages until later.[1] Microsoft released the first version of Windows on November 20th, 1985.[2] Windows historian Raymond Chen says that the reason developers used Alt F4 instead of Alt Q for quitting applications was because "Quit" is a word that's specific to English. He said: This trolling technique most likely originated on mIRC, a multiple internet relay chat program popular in the late 90s and early 00s. It is very effective here due to two major limitations of the program: On April 25th, 2000, mIRC user Jamyn explained how the troll works (shown below).  "Bad Apple!!" was originally included in the soundtrack of Level Stage 3 in the 4th Touhou Project game Lotus Land Story[2], created by series designer ZUN[3] and released in July 1998. On May 20th, 2007, Masayoshi Minoshima, the founder of well-known, Touhou-affiliated doujin club Alstroemeria Records[4] released a remix of "Bad Apple!!" featuring the voice of Japanese pop singer Nomico[5] in an album called Lovelight[6]. One of the first MADs of "Bad Apple!!" was uploaded on March 28th, 2008. While its peak has likely passed, MADs based on the song are still being published on YouTube[7] to this day. On June 8th 2008, a Nico Nico user made a video[8] featuring a storyboard with precise details of what he considered would be the best video clip for the "Bad Apple!!" song. His video has accumulated more than 900,000 views on Nico Nico Douga alone. Here is a translated version available on YouTube: As the idea began to spark interest, the first draft[9] video was uploaded on October 26th, 2008: "Bad Apple!!" exploded on October 27, 2009 when Nico Nico Douga user Anira (あにら) released the last draft of his work on the video[10], inspired by the 2008 fan version. This video, made with 3D moving models and silhouette shadow art featuring a great amount of the female cast from the Touhou series hit YouTube the same day. In addition, the original NND video became the first to reach 10 million views , making it one of the most watched videos in the Japanese video-sharing community (English subtitled version[11]). As a result of the video's success, many Touhou articles[12] were published, mostly praising it as an art form.   The source video material for the Red Army Orchestra remixes comes from the Long March Song Cycle (Chinese: 长征组歌) video, released in 1976: On June 18, 2010, the first Red Army Orchestra video parody was uploaded to Chinese video-sharing website Tudou by user 小智是猪. It is synced to Wavin' Flag, the official 2010 FIFA World Cup song by K'naan. The original video would receive only 15,000 views. However, after July 2, 2010, the fad really took off when user 地球救济 uploaded a Red Army Orchestra video to Tudou synced to Michael Jackson's hit single, Beat It. This video and copies of it (2 copies with 5 million+ views and 2 copies with 500,000+ views), would reach over 11 million views on Tudou, its popularity boosted when it was posted on the popular Chinese forum, MOP.    On May 21st, 1980, the second film in the epic space opera series Star Wars was released, featuring a scene in which the antagonist Darth Vader reveals himself as Luke Skywalker's father in an attempt to manipulate him into betraying his comrades (shown below). Throughout the 1990s, the line subsequently became a widely used trope[1] in television and film, including parodies in the 1999 comedy Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (shown below, left) and the animated children's movie Toy Story 2 released the same year (shown below, right).  Interview with the Creator: Tuzki was created by Chinese netizen Wang Momo in 2006. Supposedly, she was nicknamed "rabbit" in her childhood and learned how to paint, drawing rabbits in her free time. The earliest working image of Tuzki on her blog that can be found was posted on September 6, 2006. On November 7, 2006, she posted Tuzki on her blog, with this GIF being the original: Later, she also created a small series of Tuzki videos for publicity: The American conservative / libertarian populist political movement known as the Tea Party began holding demonstrations as early as March 6th, 2009.[1] On March 28th, 2010, Flickr user Pargon[2] uploaded a set of photos under the tag "Teabonics." The photos featured signs and banners with incorrect spelling and grammar from various Tea Party protests around the country, and were accompanied by the following description: The phrase was popularized by the 1999 movie Fight Club[1] based on the 1996 novel[2] of the same name by American author Chuck Palahniuk.[3] In the movie, the main character is shown reading an excerpt from a Reader's Digest article told from the perspective of a man's organs. The actual stories[4] were published in Reader's Digest singly over several years and published as a compilation[5] in 1986. In these stories, the name used was "Joe," but it was changed to "Jack" in the film's screenplay.[6]     Spider-Man (スパイダーマン, Supaidāman) is a Japanese superhero television series produced by Toei Company in 1978, based on Marvel's popular Spider-Man character. While Toei's version of Spider-Man's costume was based on the original, the overall plot and storyline had little to do with the Marvel character in the original canon. Producers Tōru Hirayama and Susumu Yoshikawa initially sought to make the series faithful to the famous web-slinger's origins, but Japanese toy manufacturer Bandai, one of the sponsors, told the studio to include a giant robot for the hero (as giant robots where becoming extremely popular at the time). Hirayama and Yoshikawa met their demand with complete incredulity, reluctantly rewriting Spider-Man's origins for the show. Many things about the show were considered by several people quite strange, such as the gigantic monster enemies, Spiderman's aircraft "Marveller" that can transform into a giant mecha robot "Leopardon" and his car called the "Spider-Machine GP7", as well as his need to yell out his name ("Spy Darma!") and freeze in awkward poses (often using strangely placed jumpcuts) during his entrance scenes. In addition, there are many misheard lines found in serious scenes of the series. The series had a major impact on other Japanese live-action superhero shows by popularizing the use of piloted giant robots to destroy giant monsters. This series also introduced the formula of featuring monster battles on two scales in the same episode. This formula would latter become a staple of the Super Sentai series (which would latter be adapted in North America as the Power Rangers series with major success), starting with its third entry, Battle Fever J, which was originally planned as a tokusatsu version for another Marvel Comics character, Captain America.  The first version of the song was created by Niconico user Seramikarutitan[1], or Sera for short, and was uploaded to the video sharing site on May 26th, 2007. Originally a guitar composition, the MIDI karaoke-style video featured lyrics describing the player's inability to defeat Air Man, so he can make it through the Heat Man stage on Mega Man 2, while featuring Mega Man dancing and mouthing the lyrics. The video (shown below) was well-received with users on the site, helping the song to gain over 395,000 views as of March 2014.   On August 10, 2010, photo aggregation blog theCHIVE posted a series of pictures of a girl holding a white board with the following description as to the origin. The notes contained on some of the boards expresses the hatred "Jenny" has towards her boss and reveals some private information like his on the clock FarmVille habits.     On July the 2nd 2005, YTMND user AcidicConcepts made a YTMND site featuring Takeshi Kaga in one of his show's opening scenes where he is seen biting into a bell pepper. That site was called I love bell peppers!, having a short loop of the scene while the Dragonforce 2004 Fury of the Storm song is playing in the background. According to YTMND wiki, The audio loop was already used in another previous YTMND-site and the .gif animation was found in an AlbinosBlackSheep forum thread from early 2002. The Iron Chef episode from which the animation has been made of is unknown. As of today, that first YTMND has got more than 300 000 views and rated 4,32 out of 5 on the website.  According to Facebook user Will Welling, the original photograph was taken during an investigation of hazardous waste disposal in Dutchess county, New York, and the man in the photograph was a property owner at a location they were inspecting (shown below). The image is said to have entered online circulation through various forum discussions in the mid-2000s, with its earliest known appearance in a post on the Esportbike Forums on October 17th, 2013.[13] The photograph drew much curiosity from the viewers due to his casual attire and nonchalant body language in contrast to four other individuals that are fully dressed in HAZMAT suits and oxygen tanks.  Masked Rider is an American adaptation of the Japanese television series Kamen Rider Black RX, the ninth in a line of series in the popular Kamen Rider series franchise. It was produced by Saban and aired on FOX part of the Fox Kids program block from September 16, 1995 to August 31, 1996 and then in syndication from September 9, 1996 to September 1997. The main title character of Masked Rider, Dex, was first featured in a 3-part Power Rangers episode titled, "A Friend in Need," one week before his own series debuted. The Rangers themselves were never mentioned in the Masked Rider television series, however, as Saban reformatted the series to sever links with Power Rangers, because the popularity of that series was declining at the time. The show heavily altered the original storyline and used poor editing of Japanese and American footage, even going so far as to use footage from unrelated movie Riders, Kamen Rider ZO and Kamen Rider J who looked completely different from Kamen Rider Black RX. It is even rumored that the late Shotaro Ishinomori (creator of the Kamen Rider series) became outraged and refused to allow Saban to use any more footage to continue the show. The following video is the original scene where the Masked Rider Warriors appear. On the 22nd of July 2010, a Pokemon fanart thread on 4chan's /vp/ forum was hijacked by a strange drawing of a blue frog-like creature with a yellow spiral pattern on its stomach. Within a few hours of post, more fanart illustrations of Tentaquil were created, as well as a ROM hack of Nintendo game Pokemon: Fire Red edition called "Pokemon: Tentaquil" edition, in which Tentaquil was your starter Pokemon. Shortly after, there came another hack of Pokemon: Emerald edition featuring Tentaquil. The meme began in September 2004 with the launch of an Argentinian website called SosGroso.com.ar[8], which featured a picture of American TV actor Don Johnson smugly pointing at the camera with a winky smile and the caption that read "Sos groso, sabelo!" In Argentinian dialect of Spanish, the phrase can be literally interpreted as "You're awesome! Know it!" Created by two college students Diego and Federico Marino, the site received an unexpectedly high volume of traffic, leading the visitors to send their own "sos groso" pictures to be featured on the homepage. Though circumstantial, it is widely held as true that the meme inspired the creation of the English equivalent "Who's awesome? You're awesome!" macro series.  On November 2nd, 2000, several posts from a user named TimeTravel_0 were submitted to the Time Travel Institute Forums, which featured a symbol that Titor would later claim was his military symbol from 2036 (shown below).[1] In January 2001, TimeTravel_0 began using the name John Titor at the Art Bell BBS Forums. In his posts, Titor claimed to be a military time traveler from 2036, who traveled back in time using a time machine located in Tampa, Florida. His mission was to go to the year 1975 to gather an IBM 5100 computer, but he had made a stop over in 2000 to collect pictures of his family. Titor acknowledged that there may be multiple timelines for future events, and that his future may diverge from our own, but warned against an impending United States civil war over "order and rights."  The exact origin of the phrasal template is unknown. Since the mid 1950s, the bubble gum brand Bazooka Joe produced gum wrappers with messages written on the inside, some of which purportedly contained the message "Help! I'm trapped in a bubble gum factory!"[1][2] On February 22nd, 1961, Charles Schultz[10] published an issue of Peanuts that features the joke (shown below). On January 1st, 2006, the webcomic Xkcd[3] published a comic titled "Pi Equals," which contained the mathematical constant π with the hidden message "helpimtrappedinauniversefactory" (shown below). Similar to the "Fake Pokémon Battles" cutscene templates that spawned out of the video game series, colloquial usage of “It’s Super Effective!” may be largely attributed to the global success of Pokemon franchise. The phrase was first introduced with the English version of Pokémon Red and Green released on September 28th, 1998. In Pokémon battles, certain moves are considered more effective than others depending on the respective Pokémon types. For example, Water-type attacks do additional damage to a Fire-type Pokémon, which results in the announcement “it’s super effective!” on the player’s screen. A full listing of attack damages by Pokémon types is shown in the chart below:      On November 6, 2007, Honglaowai posted his first video to Youtube and on November 7th, to popular Chinese video-sharing sites (including Tudou, Youku, 56). The video was a result of him teaching himself how to speak Chinese and subsequently falling in love with Chinese culture. He made the video as a celebration of the 90th anniversary of the October Revolution which featured him singing, Without the Communist Party, There Would Be No New China, topless, and against a wall with a Mao Zedong poster. In the next two weeks, he released two more videos: The East Is Red (Chinese: 东方红) (November 13, 2007) My Chinese Heart (Chinese: 我的中国心) (November 18, 2007) The original photograph of Stephen was posted on his father Allen Rout's website on March 19th, 2000.[1] According to several Japanese sources, the earliest instances of Gedo Baby were initially posted on the Japanese imageboard Futaba Channel (2chan) circa late 2004, with Stephen's picture superimposed over an illustration from the popular Japanese comics Hell Stadium.[2] Quite reminiscent of Advice Dog and similar image macro memes, Gedou Baby iterations typically carry outrageous messages or inappropriate suggestions created by Japanese internet users.   The phrase "Fuck tha Police" was originally introduced in a gangster rap song by the group N.W.A with the 1988 release of the critically acclaimed album "Straight outta Compton." Upon its release, the song came under the media spotlight for its controversial and violent lyrics about maiming and killing police officers. Throughout the 90s, N.W.A's "Fuck tha Police" was covered by a number of other well-known hip hop artists and the expression gradually came to represent the tension between the law enforcement and urban area residents fueled by accusations of racial profiling. The phrase also rose to prominence after it was adapted as a popular fashion statement in t-shirts worn by counterculture musicians and celebrities.  The image was published on the synthesizer blog MatrixSynth[2] in a post titled "Space ARP" on June 13th, 2006, which credited Andy Squirrel as the creator of the picture. The post also revealed that the keyboard used in the image was a 1972 ARP Odyssey[1] analog synthesizer released. On September 18th, YTMND user napalmnabuco created a page titled "catonakeyboardinspace"[3] under the subdomain "whatyouseewhenyoudie.ytmnd.com", which included the original Space ARP image accompanied by the song "Brazilian Flower"[4] by the electronic musician Jean-Jacques Perrey.[13] As of April 4th, 2012, the page has accumulated over 915,000 views.        On 2007 Orbit Gum launched a commercial titled "Dirty Mouth Test 37", advertising their new Orbit Raspberry Mint. The video went viral. The script contained a bunch of euphemisms that combined with the funny situation of the commercial caused a nation-wide sensation, not only on the internet but on pop culture as well.  The phrase Sad Panda originated from the South Park episode Sexual Harassment Panda, which aired July 17th, 1999. In the episode, the kids in Mr. Garrison's class are introduced to the Sexual Harassment Panda in order to learn how to recognize it and prevent it in school. While explaining to the class about sexual harassment, Sexual Harassment Panda describe instances of it, after each saying how is makes him "a sad panda." The Urban Dictionary entry for "Sad Panda" was submitted on December 19, 2003.    Plank is the imaginary friend of a character named Jonny 2×4 on the popular children's show Ed, Edd n Eddy that aired on Cartoon Network from January 4, 1999 to November 8, 2009. The character would be seen at random and often would appear to be starring at someone or something. Being a wooden board, its face never changed and always had the same expression.  On October 17th, 2006, YouTuber linguica uploaded an interview with political commentator Bill O'Reilly on the American news channel Fox News (shown below, left) and a scene from the HBO crime drama series The Wire with laughs tracks edited into the background audio. In the first seven years, the videos received over 150,000 and 450,000 views respectively. Buddy Christ first appeared in the film biblical comedy Dogma, which was released on November 12th, 1999.[2] In the film, a cardinal introduces a group of reporters to a rebranded crucifix for the Catholic church, the Buddy Christ. On July 29, 2010, a Reddit user shaneblog posted a thread titled Oh Sh*t, Not Again, with a picture of Keanu Reeves sitting on the steps, enjoying some juice while wearing a helmet. The domain name Lemonparty.org was registered on October 3rd, 2002, according to DomainTools.[1] The entire site consisted of the pornographic image set to the 1963 doo-wop song "If You Wanna Be Happy" by Jimmy Soul. As early as November 21st that same year, the site[2] was updated with a hyperlink to a picture of a cat which read "omfg crazy! Click here to wash your eyeballs!"  JAKA JAN was appeared in the 3rd episode of the second season of TV anime series K-ON!, which was first aired in April 20th, 2010 in Japan. It was a remark by Yui Hirasawa when she showed her ideas for not making Ritsu Tainaka, the drummer of the band, feel lonely in the back. One of the earliest uses of this type of facetious commentary appeared in the March 11th, 1993 episode of The Simpsons titled “Last Exit to Springfield.”[1] In the episode, Bart utters “the best part was when the buildings fell down” (shown below) while watching a television segment titled “When Buildings Collapse.” These types of comments became popular on multiple 4chan boards in early 2008, specifically on /a/ (Anime and Manga). One of the first instances was posted on February 8th, 2008[4] in a discussion about Masako Nozawa, the voice actress who played Son Goku in the original Japanese Dragon Ball series. Jack Black's Word of the Day skit was first uploaded to Sesame Street's official YouTube channel on July 18th, 2008 as a teaser for the 4161th episode of the children's show which premiered on digital cable television channel PBS Kids Sprout on August 11th, 2008. As of February 2013, the YouTube video has been viewed more than 5.7 million times.     in April 2010, brazilian Youtube vlogger Felipe Neto became famous in the Brazilian youtube community with his webshow "Não faz sentido"(It doesn't make sense) where he rants about what he thinks is "wrong" with society, namely the success of pop singers such as Justin Bieber, Fiuk or books such as Twilight. Felipe Neto on "Twilight" Felipe Neto on people who write with bad grammar on purpose Felipe Neto on Justin Beber Needless to say, that was too much for fans of Fiuk, Justin Bieber or Twilight. And a fan of all three stepped forth to say her own opinion.  In the original episode, which aired November 11th, 2005,[1] Spongebob and his friend, Patrick Star, are searching for Spongebob's pet snail, Gary, who has run off. Squidward, is taking a bubble bath and hears the two yelling. He sticks his head out the window and says to himself, "What are those Neanderthals up to?! Don't they know I'm busy spoiling myself?" Spongebob and Patrick then barge into Squidward's bathroom, scaring him. Upon their entry, Squidward begins screaming (shown below). This meme originated on Facebook in June 2010. It is an Ausralian meme. The first instance of this meme was a page named "Throwing bricks at sluts", which was then mimicked and parodied several times. [to be updated; this entry's open for editorship request!] Sometime in November of 2009, a mysterious man wearing a beige sweater began showing up in the background of UK's various live news reports. The first known instance of this was during an anti-BNP protest outside the BBC TV Centre. During the event, he was seen on-camera ten times, on both BBC and Sky News. Only a few weeks later, he was spotted again during a BBC field report on a fire in Peckham. His antics were featured on the BBC 3 show Russell Howard's Good News. In May of 2010, after an apparent hiatus, he resurfaced during various reports on the UK's general election, including BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Sky News. In the weeks that followed, he was spotted in dozens of other reports, making his way into BBC1's one o'clock news several days in a row. He has been spotted several times since then, most recently on December 2nd, 2010, at Victoria Station in London during a Sky News report.  On July 28th, 2010, North Alabama's NBC affiliate WAFF-48 News reported that local police are searching for a man who broke into a home then got into bed with a woman. According to the news story, that Wednesday morning, Kelly Dodson woke up to an intruder in her bed. The woman's brother, Antoine Dodson, rushed to her room after hearing his sister scream. After a brief struggle, the intruder escaped through a window. Antoine said the suspect left behind his shirt and fingerprints. WAFF-48 sent a correspondent to speak with the victims, which resulted in the following report: “Well, obviously we have a RAPIST in Lincoln Park. He’s climbin’ in your windows, he’s snatchin’ your people up, tryin’ to rape ‘em. So y’all need to hide your kids, hide your wife, and hide your husband cause they’re rapin’ everybody out here.” Rapper Soulja Boy, best known for his 2007 hit Crank That Soulja Boy, is a known anime fan, frequently referencing various series' in his music. On July 23rd, 2010, Soulja Boy released a song titled "Goku" for download on LimeLinx,[1] announcing it on Twitter.[2] The song features several references to the anime Dragon Ball (shown below). On that date, online publication The Mary Sue[3] published an article criticizing Soulja Boy for including anime references in his lyrics, claiming anime fans don't want to be associated with listening to Soulja Boy. Along with "Goku" the piece also mentions Soulja Boy's song "Anime," (shown below) and his mixtape "Death Note," both heavily influenced by anime. Created and written by American cartoonist Bil Keane, The Family Circus[1] debuted on February 28th, 1960. The comic centers around Bil, Thelma, and their four children: Billy, Dolly, Jeffy, and P.J.. The strip's parental characters are based on the author and his wife, Thelma. Having appeared in 1,500 newspapers over the past four decades, it is considered one of the most widely syndicated cartoon panel in the world. Anonymous artists and fans of The Family Circus have been making parodies of the original comic since as early as in 1989 allegedly distributed through anonymous networks of chain mails, nightclubs or coffee houses in America/Europe. They could also be acquired through mail or fax[9] to people who requested copies via Usenet groups. These parodies consisted of imitative illustrations and altered captions, often discussing adult-only topics and serious vices like adultery, drug abuse, animal cruelty and cannibalism. In 1992, Brian Boling was attributed as creating a cut and paste zine compilation of DFC images for his friends[2]. Without having known of the earlier version, he compiled over 100 parodies of the comic.  On January 26, 2008, an outspoken critic of Scientology, Mark Bunker, uploaded the video, "Scientology: XENU TV Speaks to Anonymous". The video was a response to Anonymous's highly aggressive initial attack on The Church of Scientology which collapsed the church's website on January 17 and led to the Anon's "declaration of war" shortly after, as shown in “Message to Scientology”. In this video, Bunker expresses his viewpoint of Anonymous's attack, complimenting their enthusiasm in Project Chanology, but criticizing their rather rash actions. He asked them to tone down their campaign against the Church of Scientology and pursue more peaceful and legal ways to protest Scientology. Seeing him as an ally and a reliable advisor on the war against Scientology, Anonymous coined him as "Wise Beard Man" with the slogan, "His words are wise, his face is beard." He got several responses from them, and responded to them the next day, as shown below.  Gurren Lagann aired from April to September 2007 has a unique style of eyecatches which are drawn in hard contrasts, emphasize solid black shadows, and always feature a large cross-shaped reflection of light. Moreover, because staffs prepared all different still images for eyecatches of each episodes, it was one of the highlights in this TV anime. On October 4th, 2003, first episode "Those Who Challenge the Sun" of the Japanese anime series Fullmetal Alchemist premiered.[1] In one scene of the episode, main protagonist Edward Elric is shown slouching on a bench with his arms spread out, explaining to character Rosé Thomas the chemical makeup of a human. Water – 35 liters; carbon – 20 kilograms; ammonia – 4 liters; lime – 1.5 kilograms; phosphoros – 800 grams; salt – 200 grams; saltpeter – 100 grams; sulphur – 80 grams; fluoirine – 7.5 grans; iron – 5 grams; silicon – 3 grams and a tracer amounts of 15 other elements. In Fullmetal Alchemist manga, the scene can be discovered in the first chapter "The Two Alchemists", pages 15-16, although the spread-armed reclining pose itself is not pictured.  The screen capture used in the image macro comes from the Spongebob Squarepants episode "Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm,"[3] originally aired on October 12th, 2001. In the episode, the character Patrick Star provides a possible solution for dealing with the threat of an Alaskan Bull Worm, by suggesting they relocate the entire town (shown below). "We should take Bikini Bottom and push it somewhere else." A Meme Generator[5] page for “Push is Somewhere Else Patrick” was created at an unknown date in 2010, featuring two pane image macros using screen captures from the Spongebob Squarepants scene. Google Trends similarly suggests that the search interest in the phrase began to pick up sometime in August 2010.  As part of user interfaces, the [Insert X Here] is a design item to make the user experience easier by guiding them. For example in the screenshot below, the MMS application for Windows Mobile, the Insert Text here box tells the user to click the box to enter a caption for the image In a similar manner, the user can also be directed to add images, graphs and other template items: On June 2006, Verdot created a cartoon man on MS Paint and afterward posted it on 4chan's /b/ board. After making some other variations of his own (such as one that references the FGSFDS meme), other Anonymous people started joining in on creating shopped images of the cartoon figure. When multiple users began creating their own, it was safe to call this a meme. Moonbase Alpha was released for free download via the Steam[2] digital distribution service July 6th, 2010. On July 7th, 2010, a YouTube user named ABadFeeling uploaded a video of several players using the game's TTS engine to say humorous phrases (shown at 1:50 below). Within two years, the video received over 103,000 views and 230 comments. The TTS engine used in the game is a modified version of DECTalk. DECTalk was a speech synthesizer and text-to-speech technology developed by Digital Equipment Corporation in the early 1980s. DECTalk was made popular by Stephen Hawking and, of course, Moonbase Alpha. DECTalk is also capable of singing by a specific set of instructions based on phonemes and frequencies.[3] On 6th August 2004, a YTMND page called Al Gore Summons a Fire Spirit[1] was started by Phange, featuring a image of former Vice President Al Gore with his hands positioned in such a way that he looked like he was summoning a fireball, due to a lamp in the background, accompanied by a remix of the Zero Wing theme heard in the All Your Base flash animation. The meme did not truly take off though until the 7th October 2004, two months later, when Paphan posted the site Kerry Summons a Fire Spirit[2], which has amassed over twenty thousand views. This YTMND also featured the Two Towers trailer music, "Requiem for a Tower", the music that would later be generally associated with the meme from then on, although other songs would also become associated with it, such as Crimson Tide[4], Navras[5], Escape[7] and the now infamous Ghost Love Score[6], which made it's first appearence on the site in one of these.   The movie line occurs in the scene where Captain Jack Sparrow and Elizabeth Swan have been thrown overboard the Black Pearl by Captain Hector Barbossa and his crew and two end up stranded on a dessert island. Jack, having been stranded on the island before reveals to Elizabeth an underground Rum Cellar which is how he survived the first time he was there. That night Jack and Elizabeth drink rum and and dance around a large bonfire. Elizabeth, having only pretended to have been drinking waits until Jack is passed out and begins to burn use everything on the island to create a signal fire so that they may be rescued. Jack wakes up the next morning to find that everything is gone, including the rum. Jack Sparrow: [Wakes up and sees Elizabeth burning the rum] No! Not good! Stop! Not good! What are you doing? You burned all the food, the shade… the rum! Elizabeth: Yes, the rum is gone. Jack Sparrow: Why is the rum gone? Elizabeth: One: because it is a vile drink that turns even the most respectable men into complete scoundrels. Two: that signal is over a thousand feet high. The entire royal navy is out looking for me, do you think there is even the slightest chance they wont see it? Jack Sparrow: But why is the rum gone? On May 27th, 2007, a single-serving site known as Sturgeonface.com[1] was created by a person only known by the alias "guy" from the email address listed on the bottom of the homepage (example from 2011 below). Its sole purpose was to compile several pictures of individuals, animals and other miscellaneous things frowning in a similar fashion to the sturgeon fish. The name of the site originally dubbed the facial expression "Sturgeon Face."  Completed on November 29, 2000 by the Chinese National University of Defense Technology, the bipedal robot was seen as a significant advance for Chinese robotics. It was named Xianxingzhe, meaning "forerunner" in English. Features: And with this robot, Chinese news outlets announced that China had joined the ranks of other developed countries in their robotics technology[1]. Due to the primitive nature of Xianxingzhe and its somewhat unappealing design, Japanese websites were quick to satirize Chinese enthusiasm over the robot. In Japan, it is called Senkōsha because that is the Japanese pronunciation of 先行者 (Xianxingzhe). On March 3, 2001, a Japanese website Samurai Damasii (侍魂) posted a page ridiculing Senkōsha as being "the crystallization of China's four thousand years of scientific knowledge," China's "trump card," and the "forerunner" of robot technology[2]: It has devastatingly dangerous hand paddles. Its face has only eyes and a nose. And it has visible power cables! Honda's ASIMO[3] Sony's QRIO SDR-3X[4], and China's Xianxingzhe placed together for comparison. Following the popularity of the first site, Samurai Damasii created a second page on March 15, 2001, "revealing" that Senkōsha was actually a lethal military weapon[5]. According to Samurai Damasii, here is how Senkōsha uses its weapon: Because of the catastrophic destruction that Senkōsha could potentially unleash, the author expressed his concerns about the future of world peace and Senkōsha's ability to make people die laughing. Soon, Samurai Damasii started receiving more 10,000 pageviews per day, with a peak of 200,000 pageviews on one day. The total viewcount is about 80 million. It has appeared on the demo before the full game release. Many people question on how she says things or on how she can narrate on documentaries.  According to Wikipedia[5], One Man Show was a television show broadcast on Los Angeles public access during the late 1990s for approximately five years. It featured a segment called The Spirit of Truth, hosted by the self-proclaimed deity and foul mouthed evangelical preacher Don Vincent (credited as Vincent Stewart). The show was eventually canceled when Vincent removed his pants on the air and requested for viewers to "look for sin." On April 4th, 2006, an audio clip from The Spirit of Truth was played during a segment of the Florida-based radio show The Hideout. On April 20th, 2006, a video recording of the program was first embedded via the skeptic blog Religious Freaks[13], which received several comments remarking how humorous the video was. In December 2005, YTMND user KingCrimson created the site "Chunk Addresses Congress," which shows Chunk from the 1985 adventure–comedy film Goonies delivering a heated "I told you" speech before the United States Congress, possibly in reference to the launch of a U.S. military operation in Iraq. The background image of the U.S. House of Representative chamber originates from a stock photograph of former U.S. president George W. Bush presiding over a joint session of the Congress. "I said there was gonna be trouble, but you didn't listen! You guys are crazy!" The original site garnered at least 160,000 views prior to being taken down with the suspension of KingCrimson's account. Over a year later, it was re-uploaded by YTMND user BTape on January 6th, 2007. The mirror site has since gained more than 30,000 views. Prior to this, the Goonies character had been prominently featured in another well-known YTMND fad Chunk is Indestructible.      One of the earliest instances of Bill Gates being referenced in a chain letter e-mail occurred around 1994 in e-mail claiming that Bill Gates is actually the Antichrist:  In 2004, the Christmas special Ed, Edd n Eddy's Jingle Jingle Jangle was premiered on Cartoon Network. The scene of origin (seen below) shows a bewildered Eddy finding that one of his presents for Christmas (much to his dismay) is a dickie. In recent years, starting most notably in 2008, people used the phrase "A Dickie?" or much more just "Dickie" or the phrase without the "ie" at the end, in YouTube poops or parody videos. On December 18th, 2002, a series of mock LiveJournal entries were posted on the Internet humor site SomethingAwful,[1] including one titled “Hey guys, what’s going on in this thread?”        The phrase "This isn't normal, but on meth it is" originated from an anti-drug campaign advertisement for the Montana Meth Project issued in March 2008. Due to the campaign's shock appeal, including its gritty portrayal of meth addicts, the slogan quickly became a subject of discussions and mockeries in the blogosphere and forums, including a thread on 4chan's /b/ (random) board dating to April 22nd, 2008, which went on to spawn more than 110 parody images.   The first Future Conan YTMND was Conan in the Future, (Uploaded on December 31, 2005 and currently has over 280,000 views). [Note: The YTMND has been replaced with alternate content] It was a derivative of the Conan is… meme. The YTMND was a splice of both the YTMND Conan … HAS GONE INSANE! and Apple commercial 1984. The music used in both YTMNDs is Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This) by Eurythmics. The YTMND turned into a fad, with derivatives being created (often with "Sweet Dreams" as BGM). The eventual result was a loose, convoluted storyline. At some point before January 2006, Future Conan was so popular that the Top 5 YTMNDs were all Future Conan YTMNDs. On July 19th tv.gawker.com posted a video about a pug named Teddy Almond Turtle, a dog which lets loose a high pitched squeal/bark/howl? The noise sounds as though he is shouting "Batman". The video soon found its self on the front page of Yahoo.com via ABCnews.com. Currently parodies are showing up, in particular the dog's shouting to the Adam West Batman TV theme song, found via Buzzfeed.com. Still early in its life, this clip (mirror of original video that was removed from youtube) has the potential of spreading more. Also featured on college humor and huffington post. In less than 2 weeks the parody video of Teddy singing the Adam West Batman theme song has reached nearly 1.8 million views on youtube alone.     The 'Not-Cleverly Named Character Meme' or DeviantArt Age Meme is an exploitable fad created by DeviantArt member Amber Neely on May 25, 2009 in the vein of Nyu's Art Meme. Amber made the template because she wanted there to be a DeviantArt meme that didn't take long to do and that everyone would be able to do. It caught on at DeviantArt immediately, with the first derivative of it being made the next day, accumulating over a thousand comments on the picture and over 225,000 page views, with many of them being DeviantArt links to other user's responses, and it has since become the first response when Character Meme is searched on DeviantArt. [Original Page]  The anime adaption of the manga, Fight Ippatsu! Jūden-chan!! first went on the air on a pay-per-view channel, AT-X, from June 2009 to September 2009. This anime itself hasn’t been picked up its splendidness by any media in particular because it didn't catch much attention, having a low number of viewers. Its ending sequence shows the protagonist Plug Cyrostat, jogging on a treadmill while her tiredness caused her to fall on Sento Oumi. The ending's theme titled "Please, Sweet Heart" (お願いSweet heart, Onegai Sweet Heart) was sung by Kaori Fukuhara. Despite the anime being overlooked, it later gained some attention when several people took the ending and reproduced it just for fun. Uboa comes from the 2004 adventure game Yume Nikki. Yume Nikki was released in 2005 under version 0.00. The game was re-released in October 2007 under version 0.10, which included an English translation. The game, along with fan-made sequels and spin-offs, is available for download in both English and Japanese versions from a fansite, Madotsuki's Closet.[2] In an igloo in Pink Sea inside the Snow World area of the game, there is a 1 in 64 chance that after turning off the lights in the room, the character Uboa appears (unless Poniko is killed by the player). If the player interacts with him, the player gets teleported to a weird nightmarish place with a monster bleeding on its background and some characteristics resembling a place called White Desert from the same game. The only way to exit the nightmare is by pinching yourself and returning to the real world (shown below). Uboa's name originated from a type of scream in Japan. It is pronounced 'uhoa' (ooo-hwha), resembling a scream.    The exact origin of the Smile.jpg creepypasta is unknown but is rumored to have been first posted on the /x/ (paranormal) board on the imageboard 4chan in 2008. According to the occult-related blog Aether Paranormal,[1] the earliest known image tied to the story is a polaroid-style photograph of a dog with human-like teeth and bloody finger prints (shown below). During the rise of social networking sites such as MySpace, certain photography habits in profile pictures and galleries became common throughout the sites, such as the infamous Myspace Angle. Soon, internet users began to notice certain trends in photos. Turning images into black-and-white, girls kissing girls, using a mirror for "cute" photos and excessive pouting became a few of the many practices that became common in many Myspace and Facebook galleries. On an unknown date in early 2010, a user that took note of these habits started to draw pictures depicting these actions. The earliest evidence of these threads is an archived thread (CAUTION: NSFW) from May 3, 2010, though some images have been sighted earlier.      On November 22nd, 1991, Beauty and the Beast was released at theaters within the United States. In the film, the character Gaston is introduced as a town hero and accomplished hunter, who becomes a ruthless traitor after being rejected by the protagonist Belle. In the film, Gaston's friends and local villagers sing the song "Gaston" to cheer him up after his marriage proposal is rejected by Belle (shown below). The phrase first appeared on the American animated sitcom Family Guy in Season 6, Episode 10 titled Play It Again, Peter[1], which aired on March 2nd, 2008. In the episode, Peter Griffin can be seen watching a fictional BET nature documentary show titled Damn Nature, You Scary, in which the stereotypical "ghetto-sounding" narrator says the phrase while observing a cheetah viciously maul a meerkat. Youngster Joey[4] first appeared in the video games Pokemon: Gold and Silver, as an early NPC opponent of the playable character, being only equipped with a low-leveled Rattata. After defeating him, Joey will offer you to give you his Pokegear number, allowing you to have rematches with him throughout the game, or often time to call to solely praise his Rattata.   On December 27th of 2007, Xinwen Lianbo aired a report on how "easy" it is to access objectionable content on the Internet. In it, 13-year-old schoolgirl Zhang Shu (张殊) says, "上次我上网查资料，突然弹出来一个网页，很黄很暴力，我赶紧把它给关了。"(or "Last time I was on the internet, a web page suddenly popped-up; it was very erotic, very violent, so I quickly closed the page.", in English). In Simplified Chinese, "Very Erotic Very Violent" is written "很黄很暴力" (Pinyin: "hěn huáng hěn bàolì"). When translated literally, however, this means "Very Yellow Very Violent," and as a result, calling something "too yellow" is oftentimes considered a part of the joke. Thus, in early 2008, internet parodying ensued along with ridiculing of the CCTV network, and "很黄很暴力" became an internet catchphrase. On January 1, 2008, a human flesh search was started on MOP forums for information about the "Very Erotic Very Violent" girl. The thread enticed users with virtual currency as a reward, and it eventually reached more than 1200 posts. The users revealed much of Zhang Shu's personal information, including her address, phone number, and other contact information. Although "Very Good Very Powerful" was used before 2007, it became really popular with its use on the official Chinese World of Warcraft website in June 2007. The Chinese version of World of Warcraft does feature skeletons, and those enemies were replaced by a different creature: One of the earliest "Hmmm Today I Will" image threads was posted via 4chan's /mu/ board (music) in early February 2010 (NSFW) and similar image threads continued to surface on 4chan and related forums throughout the summer. The meme first appeared on /b/ on August 14, 2008. It surged in popularity again on July 18th, 2010, with a thread where OP requested some OC. According to an article on the archive site The Armory[10], the first video game to incorporate defeatable bosses was the 1975 role-playing game dnd. The game incorporated many of the elements behind the table top game Dungeons & Dragons, and was designed for the PLATO computer system. The point of the game was to defeat a final boss named "Gold Dragon" who protected an orb which would end the game once collected by the player. The earliest known reference to the Internet as a video game with an end boss comes from an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) log archived on Bash.org[1] as early as September 2002 according to Google cached data. This shares the same source of origin for the expression "you win the Internet". Tropes entry for “Final Boss”[2] was created on August 9th, 2010 and defines the character as the “last major challenge in many video games.”     In 1995, KARK-4 field reporter Isiah Carey covered a story on the death of a high school student in Augusta, Arkansas. During the filming of his on-camera segment, an insect flew into his mouth, instantly causing Isiah to lose his composure and launch into a profane rant about his displeasure with the shoot location. Incidentally, the off-the-script blooper highlights the noticeable difference between his rehearsed reporting voice and his natural manner of speech. The video was originally uploaded by Youtube user bizarremedia on April 18th, 2008 as a part of their short series of news bloopers called Roving Reporter Etiquette. The line was originally said by Vegeta, one of the main recurring characters featured in the series, and voiced by English voice actor Brian Drummond in the 21st episode of Dragon Ball Z (Saiyan Saga) titled "The Return of Goku," which originally aired on April 19th, 1997.[8] In the English-dub of the episode, the main protagonist character Goku returns to the Earth after intense training in the Other World to square off against Saiyan warriors Vegeta and Nappa. As Goku powers up in rage after learning they had killed his friend Piccolo right before his arrival, Vegeta senses an explosive increase in his power level through his scouter device and yells: "It's over nine thousand!" The scene from the episode was uploaded by 4chan user and YouTuber Kajetokun[1] on October 17th, 2006. Jek Porkins was a fictional character from the original Star Wars film, an X-wing pilot who was killed by the Empire. Porkins' size and manner were deemed lulz-worthy by the YouTube community and has also been spoofed by the likes of Family Guy. The original clip: Team Fortress 2 is a free-to-play team-based first-person shooter multiplayer video game developed by Valve Corporation. There are nine unique player classes in Team Fortress 2, categorized into offense, defense, and support roles. Each class has at least three weapons: a unique primary weapon, a common or unique secondary weapon such as a shotgun or pistol, and a distinct melee weapon in keeping with the character, such as a liquor bottle for the Demoman, a kukri for the Sniper, and a fire axe for the Pyro. Upon its release, the game received critical acclaim and several awards, being praised for its graphical style, balanced game play, comedic value and for its use of full character personalities in a dedicated multiplayer only game. To promote the game, Valve has released an ongoing video advertisement series entitled "Meet the Team" since May 2007. Constructed using the game engine and slightly more detailed character models, the series consists of short videos on individual characters, displaying their personalities and tactics. The videos are usually interspersed with clips of the character in combat in the game. The manners which these are presented have varied drastically. The videos have been used by Valve to help improve the technology for the game, specifically improving the facial animations, as well as a source of new gameplay elements, such as the Heavy's "Sandvich" or the Sniper's "Jarate". Newell has stated that Valve is using the "Meet the Team" shorts as a means of exploring the possibilities of making feature film movies themselves. Newell believed that only game developers themselves have the ability to bring the interesting parts of a game to a film, and suggested that this would be the only manner through which a Half-Life-based movie would be made The original GIF file was uploaded via London-based blog Pants On Head[1] sometime in June 2002. This image became very popular on the site and brought a significant boost to the site's traffic, according to its subsequent blog article[2] posted on July 12th, 2002. The choreography was modeled after the CGI animation of a dance routine originally used by the Korean pop group C.L.E.O for the single titled "Illusion." The video was found and uploaded by YouTubers Bbjenks on May 1st, 2009 (account now closed) and sergiu521 on September 25, 2010. (Gif animation from about 0:35 to 0:48 on the clip.) The dance moves were animated with dance simulation software D-Player by Korean software developer SpaceIllusion, which has a free downloadable Spider-Man character model.  The still shot originates from an unknown scene in "The World of David the Gnome,"[1] an animation series exploring the world of gnomes in great details through the main character David. The origin of "How about I slap your shit" macro remains in veil but its earliest known instance dates to February 2010, which first appeared on 4chan during the height of Epic Beard Man frenzy. In the original AC Transit Bus Fight video, the quote "I'll slap your shit" can be heard during the hostile exchange between Thomas Bruso and Michael: Perhaps due to the arguable resemblance between David the Gnome and Thomas Bruso, some of the first Epic Beard Man image macros featured David with captions like "I'm a motherfucker" and "I'll slap your shit." This meme originally comes from the Sega Saturn game Sega Rally Championship. The game over would say, in an upbeat theme, "GAME OVER YEAH!!!!". There are some multiples of the sound clip on YouTube from different versions of the game but the most watched version is from the Dreamcast version and has received in excess of 400,000 views since being uploaded in January 2008. YouTube Insight on the video reveals that the earliest links to this iteration come from the SomethingAwful Forums as early as April 2008, mostly in threads from the Games or FYAD forums. The ProjectCovo Forums and reddit would later start referencing the video as well. One of the first uses in a YouTube Poop was in the video Exploding Bats may result in GAME OVER YEAH! (embedding on the video has been disabled) posted in December 2007. Even before being used in YouTube Poop videos, YTMND user Odendo posted Game over yeah! looping the sound clip back in July 2005. However, earlier still, the game over screen was quoted in one of the original G.I. Joe PSAs created by Eric Fensler sometime in 2003.    On February the 14th 2001, Everything2[1] user phenylketonurics submitted a post titled "Blinking and Breathing," in which he lamented being conscious of involuntary bodily functions. The earliest known mention of this type of of suggesstion used as trolling tactic was posted by Slashdot user ThinkAboutYourBreath[2] on February 1st, 2004: The catchphrase was first introduced to the game in the Sniper vs. Spy update [1] where the developers added specific class "Domination lines" (a short phrase in which a class makes fun of another, after killing him 3 times) to the Spy. There was one that stood out of every other one, the This is Scout, rainbows make me cry line. After approximately a month, a deviantART user created a flash regarding a Blu Scout and Red Spy from the game. The spy simply says, "May I borrow your earpiece? This is Scout, rainbows make me cry!" followed with the Scout hitting the Spy with a bat. The animation was later put on youtube, by an user named strongrudder. From this video, many other users began remixing and changing the original animation, as well as making their own Garry's Mod versions and parodies. http://kobb.deviantart.com/art/Rainbows-Make-Me-What-Now-125859500 The interview was recorded in the night club "Compass" ("Компас") in the Russian city Veliky Novgorod by the local television company "Triada".[16][17] The first video clips of the interview appeared on March 28th, 2008 on Russian websites often titled as "Very Bad Music" ("Очень плохая музыка”) in Russian.[18] The oldest known Youtube upload of the video clip was on October 11th, 2008 by user 4gfdy.[1] A subtitled version was posted by YouTuber Rammsteinchile95 with the title "Very Bad Music" on January 5th, 2010. The translation revealed that the interviewer was asking a man about the genre of music playing in the club, to which he responds by breaking out in dance to the song "Sound of Sunday" by Joonas Hahmo.[4] On March 12th, 2013 the television company uploaded the full interview in high quality on Youtube providing more information about the video clip. The full interview reveals that the reporter Varvara Brandl (Варвара﻿ Брандл) wants to learn about trance music in the club for the show "Rayn" ("Рэйн").[16] The music in the end of the full interview is "Atlantida" by Alexander Popov feat Syntigma.[19] There is almost no information about "Compass" in Veliky Novgorod on the internet. The few sources show that between 2008 and 2009 it was a location where every Thursday DJs played music for students.[20][21] The man in the video is unknown, but the blog Tribute to Dimitri[5] tracked down several photos from other sources of at least someone looking like Dimitri. The earliest parody video was uploaded to YouTube[6] on January 27th, 2010 and was accompanied by subtitles complaining about bots found on the online game "Silkroad online" by Joymax. Joymax has been failing to fight the bots for many years.    On October 13th, 2009, YouTuber rozzzafly[1] uploaded a video of her friend's 6-10 week old kitten Atilla Fluff being tickled repeatedly. Within two weeks, the video had over 7,000,000 views and it accumulated over 61 million views as of March 13th, 2012.[2]  According to Lurkmore[4] and Encyclopedia Dramatica,[5] the "Pig Disgusting" insult first started on 4chan's /b/ (Random) board in 2007 from a copypasta featuring a Korean ranting about American culture, which is referred to as "PIG DISGUSTING" (shown below). Although it is unknown when 3D was added to the insult, it is speculated this first happened on 4chan's /a/ (Anime & Manga) board due to the focus of the board. I'M KOREAN SON OF A BITCH AMERICAN AMERICAN IS PIG DO YOU WANT A HAMBURGER? DO YOU WANT A PIZZA? AMERICAN IS PIG DISGUSTING GEORGE WALKER BUSH IS A MURDERER FUCKING U.S.A  On October 28, 2004, Salon.com posted a now dead link to a 21-second video clip it obtained from Austin, Texas-based advocacy group Texans for Truth of George W. Bush complaining to an off-screen individual believed to be his then aide Karen Hughes before smoothing out his hair and quickly flipping off the camera, which garnered hoots and laughter from the production crew. As the video continues, the crew can be heard wondering if the camera was rolling while the incident occurred, with Bush describing it as a "one-fingered victory salute".[1] "Damn it Feels Good To Be A Gangsta" is a 1992 song by the rap group 'Geto Boys' (show below.) The song slowly became popular outside of the web before it was uploaded to YouTube and received a large amount of views and likes. The original song was also featured in the well known comedy movie 'Office Space'.  The Internet culture wiki Oh Internet[2] claims that the phrase “Ha Ha Ha, Oh Wow” first gained notoriety on 4chan circa 2007 with a two-pane comic taken from a 1950 edition of the daily cartoon series The Adventures of TinTin,[1] in which the character Captain Haddock laughs hysterically at the idea of a person landing on the moon (shown below, left). Before the film had even come out, the line was already being used as a marketing campaign in promos and advertisements. This included the creation of whysoserious.com[1] in May 2007, which gave hints and clues about The Joker's persona and plans for Gotham CIty. Several similar sites were made, mostly featuring images with The Joker's face drawn over them and his familiar handwriting scrawled over what was originally there. On July 18th, 2008, The Dark Knight was released and additional memes using the phrase followed shortly after. In the original scene referenced in memes online, mob leader Gamble is confronted by The Joker in his hideout and held at knifepoint. The Joker then goes on to tell him the story of how he got his scars when he utters the line, "Why so serious?" (seen below). You wanna know how I got these scars? My father was a drinker, and a fiend. One night, he goes off crazier than usual. Mommy gets the kitchen knife to defend herself. He doesn't like that. Not. One. Bit. So, me watching, he takes the knife to her, laughing while he does it. He turns to me and he says, "Why So Serious?" He comes at me with the knife, "Why So Serious!?" Sticks the blade in my mouth, "Let's put a smile on that face!" Why so serious? The exact first use of the scene and quote in a meme is unknown, but various sites on YTMND that appeared in 2008 were among the earliest examples.[2][3][4][5] The phrase is rumored to have originated on the imageboard 4chan, but an archived thread has not been found. The earliest known reference to discussion board moderators being "asleep" was posted by Sputnik Music Forums[1] Omega Red on January 25th, 2006, when explaining why the thread had not been locked. Originally composed by Canadian DJ / music producer Renard Queenston, "Rainbow Tylenol" was released under his alias Kitsune² for the album "Squaredance" on January 12th, 2009, under his defunct label VulpVibe Records (currently known as LapFox Trax). The full song would then be uploaded to YouTube on July 26th, 2009, gaining over 945,000 views as of July 2013. Though reportedly first seen in on the 4chan imageboard /b/. However, the earliest available version of the meme appeared on Reddit on May 29th, 2010. That day, an anonymous Redditor posted a variation on the /r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu[1] that received more than 460 points (90% upvoted) and 75 comments in less than 11 years (shown below). The scene originated from a Season 3 episode of the animated TV series Rugrats titled "Angelica Breaks a Leg." The episode first aired on November 7th, 1993. The remix fad began on YouTube and the /v/ (videogames) board on 4chan years later in May 2010 and the original video clip was uploaded by YouTuber Lustikk on May 11th, 2010: The earliest archived thread featuring the exploitable was posted via 4chan on May 16th, 2010:         The song was released as a single from the album Fake Songs, which was released on April 8, 2003. It was originally produced for his 1997-1999 MTV comedy show, Sifl and Olly, a show that revolved around two sock puppets who performed skits and songs. One of the many songs that played on the show was the song United States of Whatever; which premiered in 1999, during the show's last season.     On June 18th, 2010, "Struttin'" was uploaded to YouTube by user Schmoove2k6, showing an elderly man interrupting a news report. From what is said in the footage, he appeared to be a local resident of Huntsville, Alabama. The man complains about walking, and "struttin' that ass." As of October, 2010, the YouTube clip has over one million views.   According to the Telegraph[2] article titled "10 Things You Didn't Know About Paul the Psychic Octopus", Paul began predicting Germany's results during the Euro 2008 tournament when he correctly chose the winning team in four of Germany's six matches. To make a prediction, Paul was presented with two boxes containing food. One box would be marked with the German flag, and the other was marked with their opponent for the next match. During the 2010 FIFA World Cup in Germany, Paul managed to predict the winning teams for all seven of the host nation's matches.     On November 11th, 2006, one thread was posted to a /poke/ (Pokémon) board at 2channel.[1] The board was for discussing all about Pokémon. In that thread, they talked about their love for Xatu and his powerful and philosophical look (e.g. his eyes) in particular, while they began creating Two Two’s parody images. On January 3, 2007, a Wiki page[2] was launched to sort parody images and Shift-JIS art[3] released on that thread.   The precise origin of the abbreviation "GTFO" is unknown, however, the earliest Urban Dictionary[1] entry was submitted by user newbie on December 8th, 2002.  During the Mexican 2008 season Santos Laguna faced Atlas FC. The match ended with a crushing win of 6-1 for Santos Laguna. In this match Matias Vuoso had a hat trick and celebrated all three goals with an ungraceful dance which would become a hit with Mexican football (soccer) fans. The original Gendowned clip comes from an AMV posted by Youtube user Animemusicvideo on his video titled "AMV Hell 2 son of amv hell"[4] uploaded in May 2004 (now removed), the video shows an edited clip of Gendo Akari shooting Julia from cowboy Bebop[5] in the back, the video was reuploaded by youtube user LordSatal on Jun 6, 2006 (Shown Below) The original episode from which the clip is taken first aired on November 19, 1973.[1] In the segment, Kermit attempts to sing the alphabet with a young girl named Joey, who keeps replacing various letters with "Cookie Monster" to the annoyance of Kermit. The skit was uploaded to YouTube on December 18, 2006, where it gained nearly 1.5 million views. The first edit of the video, entitled "Kermit Destroys Humanity", was uploaded by SuperNES16 almost exactly 2 years later on December 17, 2008. The comments regarding the like-to-dislike ratio of YouTube videos began to emerge sometime in January 2010, following the opt-in launch of YouTube's new layout[5] which replaced its old five-star rating system with a binary upvoting / downvoting option. The decision came a few months after YouTube's official report[8] published in September 2009, which found that most videos were given one or five stars based on its old rating system. This new layout rolled out to all users at the end of March 2010, resulting in many users complaining about the new system on the official YouTube help forum[7] and the Escapist forums.[6] While the earliest instance of these comments is hard to ascertain, the first question about this type of comment was submitted to Yahoo! Answers[10] on June 28th, 2010, which asked about the origin of the trend.          The video "Yosemitebear Mountain Giant Double Rainbow 1-8-10" was uploaded to YouTube on January 8th, 2010, by YouTuber Hungrybear9562, whose real name is Paul Vasquez. The video sat dormant in obscurity for months before it was discovered by the talk show host Jimmy Kimmel. According to Urlesque[1], Bear lives on the same land plot near Yosemite. He actively participates in the Indian ceremonial culture with his kids, girlfriend, and ex-wife.       The 404 Research Lab offers the following account, HTTP status codes were established by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 1992, as a part of the HTTP 0.9 spec. They were defined by Tim Berners-Lee, the same person who single-handedly invented the web and the first web browser in 1990. The unreliable Room404 offers an unsubstantiated and likely fictitious history, In an office on the fourth floor (room 404), they placed the World Wide Web's central database: any request for a file was routed to that office, where two or three people would manually locate the requested files and transfer them, over the network, to the person who made that request. […] When the database started to grow, and the people at CERN realised that they were able to retrieve documents other than their own research-papers, not only the number of requests grew, but also the number of requests that could not be fulfilled, usually because the person who requested a file typed in the wrong name for that file. Soon these faulty requests were answered with a standard message: 'Room 404: file not found'. The 404 Research Lab rejects this explanation with the following account, Sorry to disappoint you all, but there is no Room 404 in CERN – it simply doesn't exist, and certainly hasn't been preserved as "the place where the web began". In fact, there is a display about this, including a model of the first NeXT server, but the whole "Room 404" thing is just a myth.   In a scene from the 1993 sci-fi film Jurassic Park, the hunter Muldoon, played by actor Bob Peck, attempts to hunt down a raptor in the jungle. While aiming at one of the raptors with a SPAS-12 shotgun that he carefully clicks into place, a second raptor pops its head from the bush to the left. Muldoon looks at the raptor and says "Clever girl" before it pounces on him. While the line was also used in the 1990 sci-fi film Total Recall, it has no known connection to the Internet meme.   The photo surfaced via 4chan's /b/[1] on Thursday, July 1st, 2010, with a post asking Anonymous to caption the image. The original source photograph was posted on the single topic blog Awkward Family Photos[2] on June 18th, 2010. The image was likely intended to be a memorable family photo, yet the strange partition of the father figure from the rest of family members implies sad things have happened. The phrases typically consist of him killing his family or him going psycho and having regrets as to what his family witnessed him do.   On July 13th, 2007, YouTuber PWee28 posted the original video of the teen getting punched (shown below).         On October 15th, 1999, 34-year-old production manager Nicholas White was trapped inside an elevator for a total of 41 hours, which was captured on video by a security camera. On April 14th, 2008, The New Yorker[1] posted the footage at increased speed to YouTube, which gathered upwards of 9.04 million views within seven years (shown below).   On January 19, 2010, Tiffany Philippou created the Secret London group on Facebook for a Saatchi & Saatchi competition. In the group, people talk about the "secrets" of London (good restaurants, music, activities, art, locations, etc). As of June 30, 2010, "Secret London" has amassed more than 200,000 members. Handsome Squidward originated from the Spongebob Squarepants episode The Two Faces of Squidward which aired on November 23rd, 2007. In the scene Squidward blames Spongebob for making him too handsome after hitting in the face with a door. As the mob outside becomes unruly, Spongebob starts to freak out. Suddenly, a shoe that had fallen of the foot of a an unknown bystander who was given the ability to fly when he saw Handsome Squidward, breaks through the ceiling. Spongebob pushes Squidward out of its path sending him spiraling into a column. The earliest known instance of the clip being remixes was posted in November of 2008 by SilverWingedBandit,[1] who uploaded a loop of the sequence synced to the Mega Man 7 Intro Stage Theme. The phrase originated from a scene from the Spongebob Squarepants episode Argh! in which a fish walks into the Krusty Krab, and says the phrase "Rev up those fryers, cause I am sure hungry for one-" before being thrown by Mr. Krabs. The original images with the caption "With You Always" were illustrated as a series titled " Jesus: With You Always" in 1987 by the Christian artist Larry Van Pelt who resides in Niceville, Florida. On his website, he explains:  "Nope.avi" was originally created and uploaded by YouTuber Jimbomcb[1] on January 11th, 2010, using Valve's Source Filmmaker software. The clip begins in the Gravel Pit map with a BLU Engineer character approaching the screen, who suddenly stops and utters the phrase "nope" while his neck elongates, and ends with the character promptly walking away. The embeddable clip of Nope.avi was quickly adopted by Team Fortress 2 fans who frequent Steam Users' Forums[2] to tell another user "no" in a rude manner, oftentimes for comedic effect. According to Team Fortress Wiki:  The original photo of French tennis player Nicolas Escudé was taken by Reuters photographer Jeff J. Mitchell[1] during the Wimbledon Tennis Championships on June 26th, 2003. Several years later on January 23rd, 2007, an anonymous 4chan user posted several mirrored versions of the original photo to the /b/ (random) board, with each zooming closer to Escudé's face. The photos were paired with a copypasta, which asserted that the man was the king of space. The dialogue came from "The Family Man", a 2000 film starring Nicolas Cage (Jack) and Téa Leoni (Kate). In the scene, Cage's character comes home to find the piece of cake he'd saved missing from the fridge, only to realize his wife is already eating it.  Milhouse Mussolini Van Houten is a character from The Simpsons[1] who first appeared in Season 1 Episode 1 entitled "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire." In the show, the character is portrayed as Bart Simpson's best friend who is extremely nerdy and desperate for peer approval. Because of his nearsightedness and gullibility, Milhouse is oftentimes treated an easily exploitable target throughout the series. Naturally, his inability to fit in complements the fact that he is seen as a forced meme, making it all the easier for online audiences to single him out as a loser. The catchphrase "Milhouse is not a meme" is believed to have originated from 4chan's /b/ (random) board between 2004 and 2005, as evidenced by the Urban Dictionary[4] definition for "Milhouse" submitted on January 26th, 2005: The debate over Milhouse on 4chan began following numerous waves of spam posts containing images of Milhouse. The catchphrase is said to have been in usage since 2005, but the earliest 4chan thread available on record dates back to October 2nd, 2007: "Lucky" is a dance pop single by the Swedish teenage duo Lucky Twice. Upon its release in July 2006, the song was positively received across Europe, reaching #1 in the Spanish singles chart and Top 50 in Denmark (# 5), France (# 8), Finland (# 17), Germany (# 41), Austria (# 42) and Sweden {# 43). On February 20th, 2010, YouTuber BingoKitteh posted a late happy Valentine's Day video which shows her fursona (a character or identity assumed by a person or player normally associated with the furry fandom) "Bingo" shaking its hip side to side to the song "Lucky" with a scrolling message "Happy Valentine's Day!"   Ice Car was not the first "car" type move in an Arc System Works game. Before it was "Hair Car" which came from Guilty Gear. Like Ice Car, Hair Car was the nickname for Millia Rage's Iron Saber special (performed by doing quarter circle back + punch). While Ice Car is probably the most well known these days, generally a "car" type move refers to a move that causes the character to travel forward across the screen on some sort of vehicle. For example, the character Arakune's 2C is known as "Shark Car" and Platinum's Mami Circular special is often referred to as "Heart Car". These moves are fast and cover a lot of space, but they also tend to have a lot of recovery which allows the opponent to freely counter attack if they block the move. The oldest post mentioning Jin's Ice Car is a post on the Blazblue/Guilty Gear fansite Dustloop.com in the CT Jin combo thread.[2] Though it is very likely that the term is older than this. It probably originated around the time of the game's console release on June 25, 2009. The oldest thread complaining about Ice Car on gamefaqs.com was posted on July 1st, 2009.[3]        The earliest archived comic featuring the character was uploaded to 4chan’s /b/ (random) board on August 9th, 2009,[1] which illustrated a man's attempt at fulfilling his sexual fantasy by ejaculating into his own mouth. However, upon accomplishing his goal, the character curls up into a fetal position and says to himself: "Oh God what have I done…"   Buzzfeed is where the photoshopping was encouraged. More about that in the next section.   The phrase “You ain’t got no pancake mix!” stems from a stand-up routine that was performed by comedian Zach Galifianakis as early as in January 1999 at Luna Park in West Hollywood. However, the quote didn't gain much online traction until on September 26th, 2008, when YouTuber piscator11[1] uploaded a video titled “You aint got no pancake mix!” The video features a student from Michigan’s Grand Valley State University yelling “You ain’t got no pancake mix!” at a women attempting to preach Christianity to the assembled students. As of October 2014, the video has gained over 3.7 million views.       On March 15th, 2002, season three episode 48a, titled "No Weenies Allowed," of the animated series SpongeBob SquarePants premiered.[1] In one scene of the episode, the character Sailor Fish demands that bouncer Reg lets him inside the Salty Spitoon, "the toughest sailor club in Bikini Bottom." Upon being asked to prove his toughness, Sailor Fish tells Reg that he ate a bowl of nails without any milk (scene shown below). - Welcome to the Salty Spittoon. How tough are ya? - How tough am I? How tough am I?! I had a bowl of nails for breakfast this morning! - Yeah, so? - Without any milk. - Uh, right this way, sorry to keep you waiting. On June 25th, 2010, an anonymous 4chan user started a thread on /b/ board in which other users provided humorous answers to why they should be let inside The Salty Spitoon. On the same day, Know Your Meme[2] user Caucheka archived a screenshot of the thread on the site (shown below). This is the earliest documented evidence of the scene being used as a meme format. Additional evidence indicates that at least one earlier /b/ threads making use of the format was created, but this could not be confirmed.[3][4]          The earliest citation of it that I can find is in the 1967 edition of Eric Partridge's A dictionary of slang and unconventional English: "Wait till the major hears that! Then the shit'll hit the fan!" the real origin…       The phrase "Anyone but England" was first coined by the Scottish tennis player Andy Murray in 2006, when he was asked at a press conference which team he would be supporting in the 2006 World Cup in Germany. Like most OK Go videos, "End Love" is a visually-stunning affair. Shot at Echo Park Lake in Los Angeles, the video consists of a continuous 18hr shot of the band performing, along with an additional 192 hours of time-compressed footage of the LA skyline. The band performs in a manner to take advantage of the time-compression for the final 4.5 minute video: appearing to move without walking, bouncing from point to point in time with the music, and even having an overnight outdoor nap, with each member taking a turn on "watch" to sing the lyrics. As with most OK Go videos, it has already been called "viral". In the video can be seen other people and numerous geese that populate the lake area, but one particular goose is repeated seen by the band over and over again. According to the video directors, the goose was initially hostile towards the band being in its territory, but eventually came to "adopt" the band and was completely unfazed by all the action the band made in its motions. The band and directors called the goose "Orange Bill", but later learned that the local population of Echo Park knew the goose collectively as "Maria".  This scene originates from a scene in the Super Mario World TV Show titled "The Yoshi Shuffle." In the episode, Mario and Luigi teach cavemen organization and teamwork through football. Luigi attempts to help by chiseling a stone football, but it ends up being too heavy. Luigi- Hey Mario! Look what I made! Mario- It's a stone Luigi. You didn't make it. Luigi- It's a football. I chiseled it. Mario- Well, whaddya waitin' for? Throw me a pass! Luigi- It's even official size! But not official weight… Mario- Hey, you've just thrown me a great idea! It all began on April 28, 2010, when the band's autograph session at a library in São Paulo had to be canceled after too many fans showed up at the event. Hundreds of teenagers were very upset and some of them were interviewed by the Folha de S. Paulo newspaper: Georgia Massa, one of the fans, who appears at 1:27 in the video above, ranted: Eu não tenho pulseirinha, sabe, eu acho uma puta falta de sacanagem, com o pessoal aqui que tá passando mal… Translation: “I don’t have a wristband, you know, I think it’s a f***ing lack of immorality, to the people here who are fainting…” A possible explanation for the poorly worded sentence is that she had falta de respeito (“lack of respect”) and sacanagem (colloquialism for “immorality”) mixed up and ended saying falta de sacanagem (“lack of immorality”), which is the opposite of what she intended to say.  The phrase was originally introduced to the British audiences through BBC's sci-fi police drama series Ashes to Ashes in 2008. The show is centered around Gene Hunt, the foul-mouthed, chain-smoking chief police who often says "fire up the Quattro" as a go-signal, in referring to his red 1983 Audi sedan: As the series grew quite popular, Gene Hunt's catchphrase took on a slightly different meaning outside the show. According to TVTropes wiki, "Fire up the Quattro" has been used by the viewers poke fun at male chauvinists in general, reflecting Hunt's character which as been described as "politically incorrect" and "arrogant."   The earliest known image macro (shown left) was posted in an archived 4chan thread titled “Facebook Whore Comics” on June 17th, 2010.[1] The original photo (shown right) was later posted to Reddit[14] on October 2nd, 2011 and received 511 upvotes, although its source or the subject's identity remain unknown. The stereotype of obnoxious Facebook users has been explored through precedent advice animal characters, most notably Social Networking Dolphin. The character of "Annoying Facebook Girl" also shares some similarities with Musically Oblivious 8th Grader.    This song's music is based on Cirno's theme from the 6th Touhou game Embodiment of Scarlet Devil[2], titled "Beloved Tomboyish Daughter", which was released at the 62th Comiket in August 10th, 2002 (shown below, left). Meanwhile, "Chirumiru Cirno" was first released on the Touhou remix album Touhou Taimayaku (Touhou Anti-Magic Serum), released by Conagusuri on March 8th, 2009 at the 6th touhou-only convention The Annual Hakurei Shrine Grand Festival. This song shows Cirno advertising a milk powder that apparently makes you smarter and stronger. Conagusuri launched the special page for this album[3] and released this promoting video on Nico Nico Douga on March 3rd, 2009 (shown below, right).[4] This flash animation was made by Kagi, also famous as the creator of other popular promoting videos for Touhou remixes : Cirno's perfect Math class, Marisa Stole the Precious Thing and Usatei. One of the features of the song and this animation is taking the essence from other online fads and subcultures such as Futae no Kiwami, Reaction Guys / Gaijin 4Koma, I Wanna Love You Tender, Mikuru Beam, etc… In addtion, Cirno's "Chirumiru" is coming from the follow-up infant formula "Chil Mil", an existing product released by Morinaga Milk Industry.[5]          On May 24th, 2010, YouTube user dudeuter uploaded EAT DA POO POO. The clip focuses on anti-homosexuality propaganda presentations by Ugandan pastor Martin Sempa. On May 29th, 2010 Lars Cloos aka. Donnerfurz (aka. Thunderfart) and other members of the nintendofire.de forum visited the Japan Day [2] 2010 in Düsseldorf while documenting their trip on video. [3] On June, 9th 2010 YouTube user schmatti89 uploaded a video called "Mc Donalds Qualitätssicherung" (engl.: McDonald's Quality Control). The video quickly spread over the internet. Realizing people made fun of Donnerfurz schmatti89 deleted the original file.[4] By then the video was uploaded to several video hosters and linked to in numerous blogs and websites.  On September 1st, 2006, horror film The Wicker Man, a remake of the a 1973 film of the same name, premiered in the United States.[1] During one of the final scenes in the unrated DVD version of the film,[2] protagonist, Edward Malus, portrayed by Nicolas Cage, is being tortured as a wire mesh helmet is put onto his head and live bees are poured inside (scene shown below). What is it? What is it? What is that, what is that, what is it? Oh no, not the bees! Not the bees! Aaaaah! My eyes! My eyes! Aaaaah!       Guile's first appearance in the series was in Street Fighter II, released in 1991. That game had several different composers, including Yoko Shimomura, Isao Abe, and Yoshihiro Sakaguchi. While other musicians have made their own versions of Guile's Theme, most instances are typically set to the original version of the song from the Hyper Street Fighter II soundtrack. On Dec 19, 2007 YouTuber MassEffect360 posted a mashup video titled "The Real Street Fighter" wherein Guile's Theme was used in a controversial way. On April 24th, 2010 YouTuber guilethemefitsall[2] posted the first Guile Theme mashup with the title "Guile Theme goes with Everything" to go viral, a mashup containing a scene from the 1993 movie Super Mario Bros.[3], in which Mario falls into another dimension while Guile's Theme plays in the background. The video obtained over 40,000 views in the first 3 months after being uploaded. The Guile Theme Fits All channel on YouTube has over 2.6 million views since its creation in April 2010, racking up roughly 4000 views a day. In May 2010, European pop trio SunStroke Project participated in the annual Eurovision Song Contest as the Moldovan representatives. The group chose to perform their dance pop song "Run Away," during which Sergey Stepanov gave a memorable instrumental solo with his saxophone. While Moldova took 22nd place out of 25 participating countries in the contest, the video was far better received on YouTube with tens of millions of views. The Eurovision Song Contest is an annual competition among European nations who are tasked with presenting a song representing their country. Originally starting in 1956, it stands as the 10th longest running TV program in history and is watched by more than 140 countries[1].      While the definitive source of the image is unknown, an unedited version of the photo was posted on the Gaia Online Forums [14] (shown below, left) on May 8th, 2010, making another appearance in a comment on Fark[12] that June. On September 12th, 2010, the earliest known instance of the advice animal version was posted to the single topic "Idiot Nerd Girl" single topic Tumblr[2] with the caption "Self-proclaimed title of 'Nerd' / What is World of Warcraft?"[2] (shown below, right). In 2008 cover band Rick K. & the Allnighters performed in Knoebels Amusement Resort in Elysburg, Pennsyvania. During a cover of ZZ Top's "Sharped Dressed Man" drummer Steve Moore while dressed in a golden tuxedo let out his inner Tommy Lee. Throughout the song Mr. Moore flails about in a very non-tuxedo clad manner to humorous results. The original video has received over two millon views in less then a week and has spawned multiple variations and mirrors. It is still early in its life on the internet, but could certainly continue to grow. The video which became popular was posted on June the 1st 2010 : On July 10th, 2008, pixiv[1][2] user ゆきまん created and posted a picture of a close-up face of "Patchouli,"[3] a character from the Touhou series, with an ahegao face, an expression that appears between orgasmic euphoria and the lead up to a sneeze. On January 23rd, 2006, YouTube user "iamthewalruss" posted a grainy low quality video of two men dressed in brown suits and yellow hats doing an energetic and well synchronized dance to "Deceptacon". Since it's debut, numerous video recreations have been uploaded to YouTube, typically including groups of two or more people emulating what has been called dubbed the "Aerobicon" dance.  The first example of a one take appeared in film as the 1948 movie Rope; however, this movie was only edited to look like a one take.[1] The first example of a film that was a real one take and not simply edited to look like one was the 1982 movie Macbeth.[1] Bob Dylan's 1965 music video titled bob dylan – subterranean homesick blues was the first known example of a one take used in a music video (shown below).[2] A defining one take, which is simultaneously a lip-dub, is the Flagpole Sitta office video, created by a company called Connected Ventures; together, they are responsible for some of the bread and butter of the internet: CollegeHumor, Busted Tees, Vimeo, and Defunker.  The comic strip is part of a series of Touhou doujin 4-panel named Charm, which is written by doujin artist bkub. This particular comic strip was submitted to his pixiv account[1] on April 3rd, 2008. The comic (shown below, right) featured Chen riding a bicycle before stopping in front of Suika Ibuki laying intoxicated in the middle of the road, at which point Chen begins to honk her bike horn.  The contour drawing of Buzz and Woody was originally taken from a house dialogue scene in Toy Story 2:  "Lord Kitchener Wants You"[1] (below, left) was a wartime recruitment and propaganda poster created by the British Parliamentary Recruiting Committee in September 1914, based on a cover illustration (below, right) designed by the graphic artist Alfred Leete[2] earlier that year for the London Opinion magazine. It soon became the most famous product of the British propaganda campaign of World War I, and was the inspiration for the Uncle Sam recruitment poster.  Various personal accounts and Google search results reveal that jokes about "the last page of the Internet" have been around since the late 90s, hosted on various personal / business / academic websites, discussion boards and e-mail. Tracing it through Google search shows that this phenomenon was firmly established by early 1998, making a 1997 origin plausible, although it is not certain. The song "Fight Against Monsters" is written by the Japanese video game composer Yoko Shimomura[2] who is also the author of "Fight Against Armed Boss", the resource for another MAD fad Dangerous Series. The trigger video of this online parody series was a hand-drawn animation of Reimu Hakurei and Marisa Kirisame from Touhou Project series bouncing like a fish, which was uploaded to NND on January 26th, 2010.[3] "Bittan" is one of variations in Japanese onomatopoeia for fish-bouncing on the ground or chopping blocks. And, the original video on NND plays endlessly by an auto-loop feature in NND video player. On February the third, 2006, Egoraptor uploaded Metal Gear Awesome to the flash animation sharing site Newgrounds.com The parody made fun of the various plot holes in the video game Metal Gear Solid for the PlayStation (and later GameCube remake, Metal Gear Solid; the Twin Snakes), but also gave player reactions, a load of 4th wall jokes, and over the top reactions. These kind of jokes would go on to become a mainstay in the series. Egoraptor rapidly developed a relatively large fanbase. On May 30th, 2008, Egoraptor began uploading the Awesome Series to Youtube, purportedly because other users were "stealing his views" by uploading videos of his animations without permission. This gave the series a much larger audience. This quickly growing meme originated from Dwaggins' Comictunes 01: DECISION MAKING MUSIC by YouTube user nsrrenard. The video depicts a non-gendered furry standing in front of two bathrooms, one for both genders, trying to decide which bathroom to use. The music spawned parody videos wherein characters would have to decide between two things, with the "Decision Making Music" playing in the background. The first usage of the meme is Spy Sappin' Mah Decision Making Music, uploaded on October 04, 2009.      On May 23rd, 2005, Tom Cruise made an appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show, possibly orginally to promoted the upcoming remake War of the Worlds. Instead, Cruise went wild, exclaiming he's never felt this way and let the world know he loves Katie Holmes. Since the incident, many websites, films, celebrities and talk shows began to use it as a joke or as a term to say that Cruise is indeed insane. Dane Cook Scary Movie 4 The Sims Many Youtube videos have re-edited the video to make it seem as Cruise is trying to kill Oprah, rather than exclaim his love for Katie Or re-edit it as to make it seem he's receiving a gift of some sort Going to Crue Fest Katie Holmes appeared on The David letterman showing whilst promoting Batman Begins and discusses the incident with Letterman The second leg of UEFA semi-finals match between Barcelona (Spain) and Milan (Italy) took place on April 28, 2010. The game resulted in the victory of FC Barcelona, with an aggregate score of 3 – 2. On December 6th, 2008, "Jizz In My Pants," a song by ex-Saturday Night Live cast member Andy Samberg's rap group The Lonely Island, premiered on SNL and the SNL YouTube[1] page as an "SNL Digital Short" and the song's official music video (shown below). Notably, this is also the first song released by The Lonely Island. The music video features guest appearances by Justin Timberlake, Molly Sims, and Jamie-Lynn Sigler. The video gained over 84 million views in roughly 13 years, reaching a peak position of 72 in the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 in 2009. The memorable scene from the cult classic film shows two contract killers Jules and Vincent (played by John Travolta) interrogating one of Marcellus' gang members:      The original Sad Frog artwork is based on Matt Furie's drawing of Pepe the frog. The earliest archived 4chan thread[1] was posted on January 22nd, 2009, in which an altered version of Furie’s original image with the mouth flipped, saying “Feels Bad Man." On August 17th, 2009, a user on the Body Building Forums posted[2] the Sad Frog image with the caption "not good man." Pairing the frog with the phrase “You Will Never X” also began some time in 2009. Though the original thread was not archived, it was reuploaded to Polish image hosting service Kyon[3] on June 11th, 2009, noting 4chan’s anime board, /a/, as its original source.  A disembodied head version of Mario was first used at promotion booths for the Super Mario franchise at the 1992 Summer Consumer Electronics Show (shown below, left). The character would interact with convention-goers in real-time while being controlled by a human wearing a helmet controller device. A "Real Time Wario" character made was subsequently shown at conferences several years later (shown below, right). Both Real Time Mario and Real Time Wario were used in "Nintendo Power Previews" booths (shown below, left), while Real Time Mario alone was featured in the PC game series Mario Teaches Typing (shown below, right). In 2007, an updated version of Real Time Mario made an appearance at the E3 electronics convention (shown below, left) and has been used at the Nintendo World Store in New York (shown below, right). Yotsuba Koiwai is the main character from the comedy manga Yotsuba&!.[2] The manga follows his daily adventures as she learns about the world around her, guided by her father, the neighbors, and their friends.  The phrase stems from The Lonely Island's single "Like A Boss," a parody of the Slim Thug song of the same name.[1] Featuring Andy Samberg and Seth Rogen, the video premiered on Saturday Night Live as a digital short on April 4th, 2009. In the video, the Boss (Samberg) is asked to go over his daily activities during a performance review by Rogen's character. While it starts out with daily office tasks, the lyrics evolve into impossible activities. Sample lyrics from The Lonely Island's Like a Boss [2] The German Bundesliga match between FC Bayern München and FC Werder Bremen took place on March 4th, 1994. The match resulted in 2:0 with Bayern München's victory.     The first spot aired on December 20, 1999, during ESPN Monday Night Football. In the ad, one man would be sitting on the couch then receive a phone call, two guys talk, then another joins in, yelling "Wassup?". All three of them in unison yell "Wassup?". More people join and so on and so on. The campaign was based on the short film "True", directed by Charles Stone III, who also directed the commercials. As the commercial picked up popularity, parodies started to appear online on pre-Youtube video and flash animation sites and even post 2005 (non-reuploads). Parodies even appeared in mainstream media, such as Scary Movie and both British and American versions of The Office. This video clip originates in the final episode of the Death Note series which was first aird on Japan in 2007, and this episode is also famous for the well known MAD video/YTP fad Matsuda, you idiot!. In this scene, the villain protagonist Light (Kira) is driven into a corner, breaks down and laughs like a madman. His creepy laughing was so impressive among viewers in any language version. A video for the original Japanese version on YouTube[1] has over a million views and has gotten a variety of comments including "not even the freaking JOKER can hold a candle to this… and the only other laugh that comes close is the english one… which is still technically Kira's" by roflwoflsGAME and a number of others who simply lol'd and noted the extreme creepiness of the laugh. Brad Swaile, the voice actor who voiced Light/Kira in the english version, did the Kira Laugh at a convention in 2008 because of the overwhelming popularity of this scene.[2]  The practice of documenting the opening of a packaged product was initially referred to as “unpacking” as early as November 2004 in an Engadget[1] article about opening a Nintendo DS box, as well as in Joystiq[2] and TV Envy[3] articles published in the fall of 2005. The earliest known usage of the term "unboxing" can be attributed to an article titled “Unpacking the Xbox 360; hot unboxing action" posted via Joystiq[4] on November 16th, 2005. During a live performance for the show "The Successor of Uri Geller" in Greece, Uri Geller was watching a rather dangerous act by one of the contenders. While the contender was pointing a nail-gun to his head, Geller stood up and shouted "Don't Do It Phedon". (trivia: the contender's name was not Phedon, but Neofitos).   On August 20th, 2004, Season 1 Episode 6 of the children's show LazyTown premiered in North America, which included a music video for an original song about following directions while cooking and eating right called "Cooking by the Book" (shown below).[1] The song gained a considerable fanbase over the next four years, resulting in numerous YTMND[5] pages consisting of loops of the song over various images throughout 2006 and 2007, including a remix made for a YTMND[3] competition that gained over 10,000 views and one featuring an echoed loop of the song over a photoshopped image of jihadist Abū Muṣʻab Zarqāwī that garnered over 70,000 views in roughly 15 years.[4] On October 1st, 2008, YouTuber HatPerson uploaded a remixed version of the music video featuring a mashup of "Cooking by the Book" with Lil Jon's part from his 2004 Snoop Dogg collaboration "Step Yo Game Up,"[2] titled the "'Cooking by the Book' A Lil' Bigger Mix" (shown below). The video went viral, gaining over 10 million views in 12 years.          Hayley williams the lead singer in the band Paramore, accidently uploaded and posted a topless photo of her on twitter page(http://twitter.com/yelyahwilliams)on 28th May 2010, resulting on it being spread around the internet, she claimed she got hacked tweeting "well… my night just changed drastically. got hacked.4:52 AM May 28th via web".    The phrase "manly tears" became popularized through 4chan's imageboards[1] in early 2008, according to Google search results and Insights data. Though circumstantial, it was likely influenced by the recurring BAW threads (sad media or touching story threads) as well as general prevalence of martial arts mangas like "Fist of the North Star" on 4chan. The dramatization of masculine tears has been also used as a trope in popular films and television shows, particularly in Japanese animes or mangas and Chinese kung-fu movies in which alpha-male characters quietly shed streams of tear while sustaining the poker face.     The abbreviation "LOL" predates the internet and goes back to letter-writing, where it meant "lots of luck" or "lots of love."[1] LOL carries its own meaning in some foreign languages. In Welsh, "lol" means "nonsense." For example, if a person wanted to say "utter nonsense" in Welsh, they would say "rwtsh lol." In an article hosted on ucalgary.ca[2] titled "The origin of LOL," posted on an unknown date prior to 2008, a Canadian man named Wayne Pearson claims he's the inventor of LOL as an abbreviation for "laugh out loud," writing: Crediting himself and one of his friends on a Canadian BBS chatroom called Viewline as the ones who spread its usage as slang through chatrooms and Telnet-based channels, he adds: At the end of the article, Pearson says there is no backup copy of the initial chat log in order to provide proof of his claim, leaving it as unconfirmed: On May 8th, 1989, the earliest confirmed usage of LOL as an abbreviation of "laugh out loud" appeared on Page 10 of a FidoNews Newsletter,[3] in a section defining various online acronyms and slang terms (shown below).     The original video was created by Brett Tietjen and uploaded via YouTube channel mca1018[5] on June 10th, 2007. Set to Corey Hart’s 1984 hit single “Sunglasses at Night”[1] as background music, the skit mainly consists of the Broski's boastful monologues while grooming himself in preparation for a night of barhopping. Some of the highlights include his monologue about his haircut, a heavily gelled blowout[6] also known as a Temple Fade[7] or Brooklyn Fade, and cut scenes of himself primping in front of a mirror, lifting at the gym and yelling "Jagerbombs" at a bar. Before the original video was removed in December 2011, it had gained more than 31 million views.[8] On December 16th, 2011, the video was reuploaded by YouTuber MrBroskiTV[9], where it has accumulated more than a million views as of September 2012.  In July 2009, Brooklyn resident Ryan Darrenkamp created the first boozecats image after his roommate Lisa was searching for a photo of herself with a friend that was about to get married for a photo album. All of the photos, however, contained beer, so Darrenkamp photoshopped cats over each of the bottles and cups in a photo of a party[1] they both attended. On July 13th, he uploaded six different boozecat photos to a Facebook album[2] to share with his friends.   The Pokémon battle sequence was first introduced with the release of Pokémon Red and Blue in February 1996 and has since remained a staple aspect of Nintendo's Pokémon videogames. The parody phenomenon seems to have started on the YTMND community with the earliest instance featuring a character sprite of GameFAQs founder CJayC in "GameFAQs CJayC Pokemon Battle!" uploaded on November 26th, 2005.   While the identities of photographer and subjects depicted in the image are unknown, the location and year was noted on the back of the photograph: “Reopening of the South Fork Bridge after flood in Nov. 1940. 1941 (?)”[1] The image belongs to the virtual collection of the Bralorne Pioneer Museum[2] in British Columbia, Canada. The photograph was made available for public viewing to museum visitors in 2004 and presented as part of the exhibit Bralorne-Pioneer: Their Past Lives Here.[3] The exhibit was digitized for public consumption in February 2010. Currently unknown. The realist sans-serif typeface was designed by Geoffrey Lee and released by the Stephenson Blake foundry in 1965. According to Lee, the objective behind the typeface design was to "to get as much ink on paper as possible in a given size with the maximum possible x-height," leading to its noticeably high x-height and narrow spacing between each letter. In 1996, Microsoft included Impact as one of the Core fonts for the Web in its operating system Windows 98, which at the time served as the operating system for more than 90% of the PC market, giving the font a significant boost in mass exposure.   Like most rage comic style exploitables, the series is said to have started on 4chan, while the oldest known instance (shown below, left) has been uploaded to the internet humor site FunnyJunk[10] as early as on May 23rd, 2010. On the next day, a blank four-pane template[11] featuring the reaction face (shown below, right) was submitted by FunnyJunk user FunnyJunkBrah, which went on to inspire nearly 300 derivative comics[9] on the site during the last week of May 2010.     The dance parody series was originally sparked by two animated videos created by animator and Vocaloid producer Lamaze-P (ラマーズP), the first being shared to Niconico on May 10th, 2010. The animation features the character known as "8toushin", an offspring of the Mona Shift-JIS art family, suggestively swinging its hips to an instrumental version of "Ochame Kinou" (おちゃめ機能, lit. Mischievous Function), an original song created by Lamaze-P under his pseudonym Gojimaji-P (ゴジマジP). The video's title, "Fukkireta", is the past simple & present perfect simple tense of "Fukkiru" (吹っ切れる). The literal translation is "to blow out" or "break through" but is figuratively interpreted as a colloquial expression equivalent to "getting rid of a thorn in the eye" or to simply “blow off one’s worries” in Japanese. The next day, Lamaze-P uploaded a video[1] featuring Kasane Teto[2] (重音テト), a Vocaloid-inspired character from the freeware vocal software UTAU, for the first time. Partially inspired by an animated music video of his song uploaded to Niconico the month prior (shown below, left), the monochrome video shows Teto bobbing her head side-to-side to her song. On May 12th, user Riotto-P uploaded a colorized version of his animation,[3] and in response, Lamaze posted a 30 second version of his video titled "Note: Lamaze-P Is Terminated" (shown below, right). In this version, Teto is shown singing while 8toushin is featured in the bottom left acting as a metronome. The song "Ochame Kinou" is in a style known as a "Denpa Song" (電波ソング)[4], where the harmony and rhyming of the lyrics are primary to the song having any intelligibility. Even in the native Japanese, the song is rather incoherent but this particular song is more or less about one-sided love. Tumbr user thisponydefiedgravity has stated that every third Sunday of every month will be Hnng Sunday. The post has received more than 142 likes and reblogs.    In the opening scene of Symphony of the Night, released March 20th, 1997,[1] Richter Belmont confronts Dracula and the two exchange the following dialogue prior to fighting. Richter: Die monster. You don't belong in this world! Dracula: It was not by my hand I was once again given flesh. I was brought here by humans who wished to pay me tribute! Richter: Tribute!? You steal men's souls, and make them your slaves! Dracula: Perhaps the same could be said of all religions… Richter: Your words are as empty as your soul! Mankind ill needs a savior such as you! Dracula: What is a man? A miserable little pile of secrets. But enough talk… Have at you!    The trend of Duck Face photos can be attributed to the emergence of social networking profiles, most notably with the launch of MySpace in 2003 and its rise to mainstream popularity in July 2005. Myspace users could create profiles including biographical information and photographs of themselves, many of which exhibited the facial expression that eventually became known as the "duck face." On May 13th, 2006, the first Urban Dictionary[2] definition for "myspace face" was submitted by user Crohnser, which described the female version of the expression as a combination of pouty eyes and pursed lips (shown below). On September 13th, an Urban Dictionary[3] definition for "duck face" was submitted by user Mair Mair, which defined the mannerism as a two-lipped pout.   "Deal with it" as a colloquial phrase has unknown origins. The Idioms and Expressions[1] online database entry for "deal with it" defines it as a means of promoting acceptance. In mid-late 2005, Matt Furie, creator of Feels Good Man, posted a webcomic (shown left) on MySpace using the phrase. On SomethingAwful[2], the catchphrase is often used in the web forums and is where the "smug dog" animated GIF (shown right) originated but the date it was added is currently unknown. In December 2008, a graphic of Pac-Man captioned with "I'm Atheist / deal with it" was uploaded to Bibanon.org,[10] described as "the source of the 'deal with it' meme" (shown below).  On May 9th, 2010, the 5th Generation starter Pokémon were revealed on Pokémon Sunday. The starters for Pokémon Black and White included the Grass-type Snivy (Then called Tsutarja), the Fire-type Tepig (then called Pokabu, and the Water-type Oshawott (then called Mijumaru). However, Snivy (whose name was unknown at the time) began to rise above the others, as described as this post on Kotaku: (Source: Kotaku) However, some people believe this Kotaku article "killed" the Smugleaf meme, in a way reminiscent of the Family Guy Effect.             "I Wanna Love You Tender" was originally recorded by the duet Danny Ja Armi as the English version for the Finnish song "Tahdon olla sulle hellä,"[1] and was released with a music video in 1978. Many years later, the music video (shown below) would be uploaded to Youtube on February 13th, 2006. The low quality of the video helped it receive attention, most notably for the number of poorly choreographed dance routines, gaining over 1.7 million views within the past seven years.   The earliest known photograph depicting the Shoulder Cookie challenge was submitted to the Russian message board Trinixy[1] on December 19th, 2007. Later that same day, the image was reposted in a thread on another Russian message board Otvali.[2] While the identity of the girl in the photograph remains unknown and despite its memetic roots on the Russian web, the photograph is believed to have been taken in the United States, as suggested by the American flag standing in the background. Kapitan Bomba is emitted by 4fun.tv and is part of the movie called "kartony". The main protagonist of the series is Kapitan Bomba, who along with his crew Kurvix protects the galaxy from evil aliens. Cartoon can be divided into three types of episodes. Series 1 The first episodes were not emitted and can be found on the site or directly on YouTube. They are not linked to any story and every one presents a different topic. Series 2 The second type, called Series 2, consists of short sections lasting about 1 minute. It ends with trilogy "Day Cheerleader" Series 3 Began in the middle of August 2008. Episodes are longer and form as a coherent whole. It ends with section "Kutanoid". Series 4 At this time, series 4 is emitted. (source : official site) Most frequent abuses: kurva (b*tch) , kutas, chuj (pr*ck), dupa (ass), …. The series is most popular in Poland, Czech Republic and Slovakia. There is also a pc game, Kapitan Bomba, which can be downloaded from the official site no english subs in any videos yet Official site Kapitan Bomba Wiki The approach of using perspective in art dates back to the Renaissance period as "erspectival anamorphosis"[1], a type of art that requires a specific vantage point to view. The earliest known example can be traced back to Leonardo da Vinci's "Leonardo's Eye" in 1485. The German painter Hans Holbein the Younger's[2] 1533 painting "The Ambassadors" famously featured a hidden skull that could only be seen from specific perspectives. According to various blogs, the possible originator of the Jejemon phenomenon is a person that goes by the alias "LiL' ZupLadO". The name "Jejemon" likely originates from the users' tendencies to type "jejeje," the Spanish equivalent of "hehehe," and "-mon," a shorthand for "monster" popularized by the Pokemon franchise. Such practice of intentional misspelling has its earlier roots in "txt talk" (SMS) due to its short character-length capacity (160 characters per message). Its online breakthrough started on April 14, 2010 at Pinoy Tumblr. There was a post with Filipino vice presidential candidate, Jejomar Binay. With a fake poster calling him Jejemon Binay. Later, the use of the word Jejemon would be used to describe those who talked like that.  The One Point English lessons are a series of videos popular on the Internet. They feature a Japanese geisha or "oiran" teaching "useful" English sentences. The clips originated from a Japanese late-night variety and comedy skit TV show. Because it was part of a comedy show, the clips are a spoof of regular Japanese English lessons. The earliest known mash-up parody of the Thomas and Friends theme set to the vocal track a rap song was uploaded by YTMND user CookieMonster4Sael on June 7th, 2005.[12] Titled as "Thomas the tank engine and hoes," the site featured a still shot of Thomas the Tank Engine from the show and a mash-up of the theme song overlaid with a medley track of popular rap songs from the early 2000s, including Sean Paul's "Get Busy" and Kelis' Milkshake. The original photo is of two dogs, one of which looks as if he is smiling. This photo can be found as early as 2006, primarily on Russian websites and forums.[1]  The quote originated from the DC comic book Superman: At Earth's End which was published on September 1st, 1995. In the scene in question, Superman does battle against an android until he finally shouts "I AM A MAN!" before punching his foe in the gut (shown below, right). On December 23rd, 2008, internet reviewer and critic Linkara uploaded a video review of the comic book. In the video, Linkara made an emphasis on the line where he does a reenactment of the punching scene.[1] In the following years, the quote became a running gag in the Atop The Fourth Wall series, where Linkara would reenact the scene with several tweaks and variations. The earliest known footage of Kanellos was captured by a TV news crew during a student riot outside Technical University of Athens in February of 2007. In the clip, the dog can be seen keeping company alongside a militant protester with a molotov cocktail in his hand:        This highly over the top commercial was originally produced as a joke in 1990 for a faux award show put on be the Advertising Association of Baltimore called The Ad Follies. The AAB searched for agencies willing to produce ad spoofs mocking the top agencies in the city despite the impending threat that people working on these spoofs may place their jobs in jeopardy for doing so. The production was conducted at television studio WBFF and all of the footage originates from car manufacturer promotional videos and generic stock footage. The writer and narrator of the copy are still both unknown. The video was never intended to be shown outside of The Ad Follies show because of the vulgarity and the possibilities of being viewed by the mocked. Copies were only distributed to people who worked on production and to WBFF employees following the screening. The Origin of Big Bill Hell's is currently being researched & evaluated! We are still searching for more detailed information regarding its history and origin, please contact research staff via Email. Dog in couch fort The first appearance of Dog Fort was a photoshopped image created by Bishopwhitet for a contest on Cracked, titled What Your Pets Are Doing When You're Not Home, on June 4, 2009. The dog inside of Dog Fort, Bishopwitet's girlfriend's dog, is actually named Otter in real life (after Steve Ott of the Dallas Stars). His name was changed from Duke after he was rescued from a decade spent in an abusive home where he was severely beaten, neglected and probably picked on by cats (although the cat part is unconfirmed, it would explain his distrust of all things feline). He lived the next two years in peace and comfort, although now it's evident that his calm demeanor was simply a subterfuge to cover his preparations for the epic battle to come. He developed Leukemia in late 2009 and was recommissioned to the great Dog HQ in the sky where he currently uses his jedi power over death to preside over his armies. Long Live Dog Fort! The original image of the couch fort was taken by Flickr user Jenville with an iPhone on March 3, 2009, which shows to have housed a 5 year old. Dog in lobster outfit The corgi wearing the lobster outfit was a viral image itself before becoming part of the Dog Fort series. The photo of the corgi dressed up for Halloween was taken on October 24, 2008 in Griffith, Los Angeles, CA, US, using a Canon EOS Digital Rebel XTi and posted to Flickr. There is a BuzzFeed post with many dogs wearing lobster costumes. The first comic Sometime in May of 2010, Know Your Meme user Von Smallhousen, while at work, came across the Dog Fort entry which had since become deadpooled. Finding what he had seen to be entertaining, he created a comic out of the Dog Fort and Red Lobster images and submitted it to this page. His story quoted below: Becoming a meme On November 5th, 2010, Dog Fort was submitted to the /r/pics subreddit and hit the front page. On December 9th, 2010, Dog Fort was once again reposted to /r/pics, but this post happened to trigger a sequel. After the sequel was created, /r/pics began to flood with new Dog Fort comics, thus /r/dogfort was created by Jason Julias on December 10th, 2010 at 3pm in order to have a collective area for redditors to view the new meme and create their own Dog Fort comics. The official domain for the Dog Fort blog, located at Dog-Fort.com, was purchased on December 16, 2010 by Jay Cho and set up and run by Jason Julias until January 25, 2010 at which time it was moved to a new domain. The new official domain for the Dog Fort Blog, ThisIsDogFort.org, was created January 26, 2010 by Jason Julias and features many improvements. Most notable are it's move from blog style posting to a gallery view that allows users to see 100's of links to comics all in one location.   During a season match between St. Louis Cardinals and Philadelphia Phillies held at Citizens Bank Park on May 3rd, 2010, a towel-waving Philadelphia Phillies fan managed to enter the outfield and run in circles for 30 seconds, shortly before getting subdued by a police officer with a taser stun gun. A spectator recorded the incident on footage, which was subsequently uploaded onto YouTube[1] on the same day. Both the original video and another embeddable version[2] went viral, each accumulating nearly 2 million views in the following weeks. Although the incident was not televised as it happened during a commercial break, it was witnessed by over 40,000 spectators, many of whom booed in reaction to the disruption of the game.  The facepalm, as an expression, has existed long before the internet in both human and non-human societies. For example, a 1896 statue entitled "Caïn" by Henri Vidal, which resides in Tuileries Garden, Paris, France, was unveiled in 1896 (shown below, left).[1] One of the most famous and widely used variations of the facepalm comes from an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation, which first aired on February 5th, 1990. The clip shows the character Captain Jean-Luc Picard (played by Patrick Stewart) reacting to a stressful situation by placing his hand on his face (shown below, right). The website Word Spy[2] cites a 2001 message board as the earliest usage of the expression. However, the actual post is no longer available. Therefore, the earliest available usage of the phrase online was posted on February 10th, 2004 by Urban Dictionary [3] user Moondog. They defined the action, "The act of dropping one's face / forehead into one's hand. Usually accompanied by a 'thunk' or a cr a cry of 'D'oh!' Usually written between asteriks in online conversation, to demonstrate an action." The post (shown below) received more than 2,500 upvotes. History Will Be Made is a series of commercials distributed by the National Hockey League (NHL) to advertise the 2010 Stanley Cup Playoffs. The First one debuted on March 20, 2010   The video game was released in Japan on January 27th, 2010 and its original soundtrack CD album was released on the previous day. One of the features of this video game is an adaptive music generating system called "R.A.H" (Realtime Active Hymmnetics) system, which changes pitch, tempo, and melody of the battle BGM in realtime by user's "Song Magic" settings and character's stats. The soundtrack CD includes the song "EXEC_HYMME_BATTLESPHERE/.#Saki extracting", which is a battele theme song generated by "R.A.H" system for Saki, one of the main characters in this game. However, game players hardly listen to this song itself in the game because it's almost impossible to generate exactly the same song twice by R.A.H system's complex parameter calculations. One of the first known appearances of the Close Enough Guy in a rage comic was shared on humor site Regretful Morning[1] on March 17th, 2010 in a compilation of Fuck Yeah comics, showing a character who has just had sex but was unable to bring his partner to orgasm.  The photograph of the then-51 year old Cassie Booyse was taken on March 8th, 2008, by an unidentified woman who noticed his unusual appearance at the annual H2O rave party in Boskburg, South Africa. The photographer subsequently forwarded the picture to via e-mail to her friends, among whom was a man named Bryan Theunissen. Upon seeing the photograph, he decided to spread it further as a viral marketing experiment by dubbing the man in the picture "Vernon Koekemoer," a common nickname in Afrikaan language which can also serve a suggestive double entendre. In Afrikkan, "koeke" means "cake" or a slang term for the female genitalia, and "moer" which can mean either "nut" or "to hit."   The first X for Dummies book was DOS for Dummies, written by Dan Gookin and published by IDG books in 1991. The intention of the book was to be user friendly and simple to read, without any extra fluff or unneeded information. This straightforward method of teaching quickly caught on as a good idea, and more books bearing the For Dummies standard were published soon afterwards. Although initially geared towards teaching computer related topics, the For Dummies books soon picked up other subjects ranging from acne to chess.[1] This wide range of topics covered by For Dummies has made it very easy to parody, as any subject can plausibly be touched by a For Dummies book, The original "Nya Nya Dance" video was uploaded by YouTuber webkinzlid on June 24th, 2009. The video featured a fox-like character dancing to a DJ Diskant[3] remix of the song "New Day" by the electronic artist Wazari.[4] The video's name was inspired by the sound "nya", which is repeated over-and-over in the song. In less than three years, the video accumulated over 100,000 views.     In May 2004, the New York Times reported[7] that financial analyst Jayson Littman (shown below, left) had begun offering free hugs in New York City's Washington Square Park for three hours every Sunday for a month. Though Littman was advertising with a hand-lettered sign and a tee-shirt, the reporter noted the number of rejections that he received. The following month, on June 20th, 2004, an Australian man known by the pseudonym Juan Mann (shown below, right) began his Free Hugs campaign in Sydney's Pitt Street Mall. It is unclear if he knew about Littman's campaign. After 15 minutes of standing in the mall with a cardboard sign, he received his first hug from an elderly woman.[1] He continued to return to the mall every Thursday, gradually gaining supporters and expanding his hugs throughout the city, until officials banned him due to the lack of public liability insurance worth $25 million dollars.[4] After getting 10,000 people to sign a petition in his favor, he was allowed to continue offering hugs throughout Sydney.[2] In September 2004, Mann met Shimon Moore of the Australian rock band, Sick Puppies.[3] He filmed some of Mann's hugging excursions, but did not do anything with the footage until 2006 after the band had moved to Los Angeles. When Moore learned that Mann's grandmother had passed away, he wanted to do something to ease his friend's pain. He made the short film for Mann overnight and mailed him a hard copy. On September 22nd, 2006, at the request of his bandmates, Moore uploaded the video to YouTube where it gained 250,000 views in two days.[4] As of April 2013, it has amassed more than 74 million views.   The phrase originates from the PS2 video game Metal Gear Solid 3, a prequel to the previous games set 40 years in the past. If the player is to kill Major Ocelot, a major character who shows up in the other games, the game ends, with the game over screen having the character of Colonel Campbell saying "Snake, you can't do that! You've changed history. You've created a Time Paradox!". However, An overblown version of the line is used in some youtube poops Like this one here: Usually involving an implosion or explosion of some sort. Quite similar to the division of zero meme, just not as popular. The song was made by Emanuel Pougatchov Amiran (עמנואל עמירן) and its original title is "U’sh’avtem Mayim" (ושאבתם מים, Hebrew for "And ye shall draw water".). The dance was choreographed by Else Dublon in 1937. The dance was held at a festival to celebrate the discovery of water in the desert after a seven-year search. Mayim Mayim became a very popular folk-song, spawning many different versions with alternate lyrics. However, the core of the song has remained. The original (and perhaps most well-known) lyrics were derived from verse 12:3 in the Book of Isaiah, "ושאבתם מים בששון מימניי הישועה" ("And you shall draw water with joy from the fountains/wellsprings of the salvation."). The verse is part of a prophecy about the Messianic Era.[1] Since 1950s, as General Headquarters of the Allied Forces introduced folk dance to the educational program for Japanese children, almost all Japanese have danced Mayim Mayim in gym class or athletic events in their school days. Therefore, they are very familiar to this song and it is frequently cited to Japanese pop culture as all well-known music. For example, the remix of Mayim Mayim mainly reused in this fad is "Lovely Otohime" which comes from "Sexy Parodius", a scrolling shooter game produced by KONAMI in 1996, which is based specifically on the song's version from the Family Computer and MSX versions of the arcade game "Yie Ar Kung-Fu" both produced in 1985 also by KONAMI. Like this, Mayim Mayim is remixed, covered and arranged in many ways in Japan. The man portraying Captain Curious was spotted in a real life situation in the summer of 2008 while he was lurking behind a few kids. The photo was manipulated to display him as a captain (using the uniform and boat from Captain Crunch™ cereal).     The original MS Paint comic was originally posted in a Facepunch S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series Megathread[1] in December 30th 2009. The conversation in the comic goes: In game, the "blowout" (or an emission) is a sudden and powerful release of energy from the center of the Zone. It is unknown exactly what causes the emissions, but they have been linked to the appearing and disappearing of anomalies and artifacts, as well as changes in mutant behavior. This does damage to player due to radiological damage and the only way to protect one-self is to hide in a large shelter or by taking special drugs called "anabiotics" in game.    On October 28th, 2008, YouTube[1] account ALostPeople, belonging to producers Paris Diamond and Jansen, posted a video in which they perform a song repeating the lyrics, "Big booty bitches, I got big booty bitches," (shown below). Although the original was removed, it was reuploaded by the original channel in 2012, gaining over 9 million views nine years.  Photographing paper cut-out models and sharing them online began on the Korean web in early June 2004 when web illustrator Ciba[15] uploaded pictures of her hand-drawn paper models in a blog post on the portal site Daum. Titled "Paper Child" the images quickly spread through blogs and bulletin boards, spawning numerous derivative images that were hosted by Ciba's blog. The Internet phenomenon also received media coverage and the illustrator was interviewed by the Korean newspaper Donga Daily[14] on June 19th and TV show Marvelous World[13] on July 20th, 2004.    A TV anime series for Rurouni Kenshin was first aired from 1996 to 1998 in Japan and its dubbed versions had been exported to many other language speaking countries. The seed of this meme was a video uploaded to NND on April 2nd, 2007. It was an English-dubbed version for a battle scene with Makoto Shishio, the villain in the Kyoto arc, which was taken from the beginning in the 59th episode of the anime.[2] Sanosuke's Japanese shouting with a pronounced English accent in this video, "Futae No Kiwami! Aaaaah!", sounded quite ridiculous for Japanese people partly due to the fact that character voice in dubbed versions for battle animes usually sounds old and too macho compared to the original versions for their sensibilities. By this video, his shouting became a catch phrase among some NND users. As writing words by Katakana characters explains awkward pronunciations in the Japanese text representation, it's written as "フタエノキワミ、アッー！" in Katakana characters. Then, its ridiculousness was caught much attention among many NND users by a MAD video featuring a popular Touhou remix song "Marisa Stole the Precious Thing". It was uploaded to NND on August 24th, 2007, and had been watched over 1 million times until deletion.[3]  The series is named after the famous Chinese philosopher best known for his body of work Analects of Confucius and parodies his prolific writings of axioms and wise sayings like "Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself." Written during the Spring and Autumn Period through the Warring States Period (ca. 475 BCE – 221 BCE), the Analects is the representative work of Confucianism and continues to have a tremendous influence on Chinese and East Asian thought and values today. Parody jokes about Confucius' idioms have been seen on several internet humor sites like JokeCenter[1] and Unwind[2] as early as in February 2001. The earliest known instance of "Confucius says…" image macro was posted on 4chan's /v/ board[3] on April 29th, 2010. The picture used for the macro is one of the first results provided by Google Image search.      In the real-time strategy (RTS) game Warcraft 2, released on December 9th, 1995, human footmen would often say the phrase "'Join the army!', they said. 'See the world!', they said. I'd rather be sailing." In the World War II RTS Company of Heroes, released on September 12th, 2006, the engineer squad would sometimes respond by saying "Join the army they said. It'll be fun they said" when selected by the player. The TV Tropes[2] page for “‘Join the Army,’ They Said” was created on August 7th, 2010. Hotel Mario was released for the Philips CDi in 1994. Upon starting the game, players were greeted with one of the cheeziest cutscenes of all time. In the scene, Mario and Luigi were on their way to meet Princess Toadstool at a picnic when they discover that she has been kidnapped by Bowser… again! This time she has been taken to one of seven Koopa Hotels; it would be up to Mario and Luigi to search the hotels and find her. The result was one of the worst videogames ever made… But within the cutscene, one overzealous and oddly placed phrase stood out: "I HOPE SHE MADE LOTSA SPAGHETTI!" This would go on to become the most memorable line in the entire game, and also the most parodied… That's saying alot, considering that Hotel Mario as a whole is an example of a videogame that's just plain wrong. Like Weegee's origin in Mario is Missing, Hotel Mario was made during a high point in the Super Mario franchise. This bizzare puzzle game involved running through seven hotels, closing the hotel room doors and using elevators to move between floors. Once all of the doors were closed, the player could proceed. The player eventually reached Bowser's personal floor and defeated the Koopa King to rescue the princess. But the game's cutscenes, not the gameplay, are what is comically important. These cutscenes used poorly drawn visuals on par with those featured in the three Zelda CDi games. No wonder that content from both is often featured in YTPs. The scenes also feature awkward voice acting and animation that almost beg to be parodied. Other phrases such as "eh, Luigi?" (interpreted as Gay Luigi), "toast!", "nooo…", and "she's not coming down" are also used as material for YTPs. One important thing to remember is that Lotsa Spaghetti is not a "typical" meme. The phrase commonly appears in YTPs as reference rather than subject matter.     The first YTPMV was created in 2009 by a YTPMV creator MapleManiac[2]. His video, featuring Team Fortress 2 characters, "I ran out of ideas" was posted to YouTube on December 23th, 2009, and has since gained over 150,000 views in under 7 years. Sometime in February 2010, a flipped image of a Holden Commodore (a very common Australian-made sedan) with the caption "Meanwhile in Australia" appeared on 4chan via /b/ board for the first time. An allusion to the age-old joke that everything in Australia is "upside down" (due to its southern hemisphere location), the image quickly became a favorite re-blog material on image board sites, blog networks and aggregator services. Since then, multiple variations with countries or locations and their stereotypes have been posted.    Googlewhacking was first described in this original email from Brooks Talley from January 8th, 2002:[1] The best I've done with three words is "orangutan popcorn fishwife", which yeilds only one result. With four and more words it's pretty easy to find combos with no results. FYI; I'm sure you were all anxious about that. -b The term "Googlewhack" was coined by Gary Stock[2] in his response to Brooks' email on January 8th, 2002:[3] … Not fair to acknowledge word lists – too easy to spoof! Gary Stock created the website Googlewhack to chronicle the instances.[4] Googlewhack.com initially kept a tally of whacks found, but no longer does. The page was not indexed by Google in order to avoid disqualifying the over 35,000 terms originally collected.            According to an interview in the Village Voice[2], New York City comedian Todd Lamb[1] created the character Chris in 2008, intending to use the character's posted notes as a way to grab the attention of pedestrians. Lamb created posters from Chris written in all-caps with blatant spelling errors, including strange invitations like visiting the library to fight an overdue book fine or inspecting his deceased cat. Lamb hosted his photos on his personal website[3], which included the first note put up at a bus stop in Park Slope, Brooklyn.   The original scene is a clip from the A&E reality show Intervention[1], which documents the life of someone suffering from an addiction. In the show, the subjects are led to believe they are being filmed for a documentary, but near the end of the episode, they are presented with an intervention staged by their family and friends, forced to choose between going into rehabilitation or being isolated from their loved ones. In an episode that aired on April 5th, 2010, former boxer Rocky Lockridge[2] was profiled for his cocaine addiction that left him homeless. During the intervention, his son tells him that no matter how badly his dad treats him, he will still love him. The first video of this scene was uploaded to YouTube the next day.[5]     On September 23rd, 2008, the shock site BlueWaffle.net launched.[2] The single-serving site consists of a picture of the diseased vagina, with a small description. It reads, "Blue Waffle [bloo-wof-uh l] : A battered or infected lady cake of blue or green colouring, often brought about by extreme rammage to the female taco with penis or similar device. Blue Waffle infections are a result of dirty skank whoreness of the smack head variety and are abundant in areas of extreme chav infestations as well as areas high in whoredom." Mr. Six, portrayed by Danny Teeson, was created by Michigan-based agency Doner Advertising and introduced as an advertising campaign for Six Flags in early 2004. The energetic dance he performs in the commercial is thought to have been influenced by a variety of techno dance subgenres including the Melbourne Shuffle, Jumpstyle, and Techtonik. On December 23rd, 2008, YouTuber daggerrun[2] uploaded the first known instance of YTPMV parody titled "Nerd Land," featuring the face of The Angry Video Game Nerd and a remix of "We Like to Party" based on soundbite sampled from his web series. In the video description, daggerrun challenged the viewers to respond with their own versions.   The Sky News correspondent was reporting live via satelite from Scotland's Edinburgh Airport, interviewing a couple of passengers when suddenly, in the true fashion of a fearless video-bomber, a young lad barged into the interview and yelled "I HATE ICELAND" before carrying on with his friend: TV Reporter: (inaudible) …to the airport? Interviewee: Sorry? TV Reporter: You only found out, when you got to the airport? You didn't know in your hotel or-- Interviewee: No, no. I-- Random Dude: I HATE ICELAND-- I hate Iceland-- (with slightly less confidence) On December 22nd, 2006, a video titled "Three PS3s" was posted on the Internet humor site LoadingReadyRun,[1] in which host Paul Saunders shows off his three Playstation 3 video game consoles and how he uses them. On January 3rd, 2007, YouTuber tokenwebster reuploaded the video to YouTube (shown below), where it received more than 2.17 million views and 27,000 comments in the first seven years.     The meme "Dog Man" (also known as Vicious Dog Man, Psycho Dog Man, Rabid Dog Man and Barking Dog Man) started when an episode of the Australian News/Current affairs show: A Current Affair (the same show that brought us Chk-Chk-Boom Girl and Corey Delaney and his sunglasess) was aired on the 12th of April, 2010. The episode featured a story about an old man by the name of Ray Graham who talked about and did an extremely comical and realistic reenactment of his frightening confrontation with a neighborhood dog. The video was then uploaded to YouTube, entitled Psycho Dog Man on ACA. The video gained quick popularity on the interwebz, spreading to Break.com and Failblog.org, causing discussion boards to light up and attracting a lot of world-wide media attention for example like this CNN report which aired at 5:30am on Thursday 15th of April, this report aired about an hour before YouTube user Ray William Johnson uploaded this video: Psycho Dog Man. This allowed for the meme to then spread to a wider audience and allowing the Dog Man to become an international sensation.  One of the earliest pre-internet examples of human dog puppeteers can be traced to William Wegman, an American artist best known for his photographs and videos featuring dogs in unconventional settings and poses. His works have appeared on mainstream television like Saturday Night Live, Nickelodeon and has been regularly featured on Sesame Street since 1989. In 1989, Wegman made a film with his dogs entitled The Hardly Boys , which was screened with some success at the Sundance Film Festival. Click here to read more on the famous photographer.  “Torres Gemelas” M/V was uploaded to YouTube on December 18th, 2006. The video begins with Delfin flipping on the television as he sits down on a couch and the news footage of the terrorist attacks in New York appears on screen. Gemelas rises to his feet crying "no puede ser…" ("This cannot be, noo…") and segues into song.    Tecktonik originates around 2006-2007 as a street/club dance in southern Paris, especially in the Metropolis nightclub.[1] Unlike Jumpstyle, whose moves are executed predominantly from the lower-body, Tecktonik dance moves are almost purely upper-body, with heavy influences from glowsticking and leading-hand techniques. The dance also draws heavily from early Disco dances with emphasis on dramatic poses and finger-pointing. While Tecktonik dance is primarily focused on jerky arm waving and rotation, hip and footwork play a major role. The hips allow the dancer to maintain balance while performing the required dynamic arm movements which occur, and footwork allows the dancer to add movement to the dance and thus add additional dimensions. At the peak of Tecktonik popularity, dance and instructional videos began being uploaded to YouTube with many reaching views in the multi-millions. The most popular video is currently a best of… compilation with over 16 million views. The first known instance of the image appearing on the internet is unknown. It was first posted on the Gluttony Forum on the 1st March 2010 by a member named Adramalech. The thread in which the image was posted was a King of the Hill forum game. Cake had been mentioned earlier in the thread, no doubt influenced by both of the existing The Cake is a Lie and Get the Cake memes. The admin Toneo attempted to trump all previous efforts to become king of the hill. Upon succeding, he requested the aforementioned cake be given to himself. Adramalech then posted an image of the most discusting cake he could possibly find in response. Without realizing it, Adramalech had just sparked off what would shortly become a community meme. His original post can be found here. At the time, the cake had no name. It was just a one off joke. The next day Ben, the owner of Gluttony, discovered this post and replied: "Blue fur cake, my favourite.. <3". Later that month, on the 23rd, Adramalech once again posted the same image in reply to a thread wishing admin Chaos good luck in his driving test. Cake had once more been mentioned, and once more Adramalech had to outdo all others. This time he referenced Ben's response to the original image, and the name Blue Fur Cake stuck. The post in question is here. The cake had been mentioned many times since it's first appearance, being posted at any and every opportunity. On the 11th April, super admin Josh added the code :bluefur: to the forum. When a user types this code into their forum post, it gets replaced by the blue fur cake. This was added due to the recent boom in cake demand, and to eliminate the need to search through old threads to find the image. The cake was finally considered an actual local meme on the 12th April, when admin Klayking posted the following in a Corrupt a Wish forum game: "I wish for a new meme!". User id0001 quickly responded: "here it is" and posted the image of the blue fur cake, therefore securing the image's status as a meme within the community. On the same day Klayking made the post: "Think of it as a birthday present, other than the conventional Gluttonian blue fur cake!". This was posted very shortly after the meme had been made official by id0001. The meme now had a proper name, other than Blue Fur Cake or :bluefur:. Despite being around since 1st March 2010, the meme finally became official on the 12th April. KIMONO♡PRINCESS is written by the Japanese composer Junko Karashima, better known as her alias "jun". And the vocalist for this song is Anna Kaelin, a singer, and songwriter from Salt Lake City, Utah. She also sings NAOKI's "You are a Star" in these games. This song was first released as an extra track for Dance Dance Revolution X2 released for PS2 console in North America in November 2009. And it was also included in Dance Evolution which was released for Xbox 360 Kinect in November 2010.[2] In each of the games, this song is famous for its extreme difficulty among game players.   "+1" has long been used in internet forums as a means of expressing one's agreement with the preceding post. On April 28th, 2004, a definition for the phrase was added to Urban Dictionary [1] by user Joe Mama (shown below).   The palindromic name "UNITINU" comes from the first known instance of the series, which depicts the former U.S. State Secretary Condoleezza Rice standing with her hand raised at a United Nations Security Council meeting on August 11th, 2006. The original news photograph was taken in 2006 by Getty Image photographer Stephen Chernin.[1] The image shows a strong and determined Madame Secretary Rice casting a vote on behalf of U.S. government for the passage of UN Resolution 1701[2]. As a result of mirroring, the official plaque of the "United States" was turned into a non-existent palindromic word "UNITINU." The photoshopped image first appeared on 4chan's /b/ (random) board[3] in late 2006.  The origin of this meme is unknown. it was probaly first shown as a simple image of "Skeletor" holding he's head with a text below him saying "I'M SO FUCKING STONED" in imagepoop and then "invaded" into 4chan.  María la del Barrio (English: Maria of the Slums) ran for 90 episodes from August 14th, 1995 to April 29th, 1996. The series, which is a remake of the 1979 Mexican telenovela Los ricos también lloran (English: The rich also cry), enjoyed extremely successful ratings throughout its run and went on to become one of the world's most popular and widely syndicated TV shows ever, having been broadcast in over 180 countries and spawning a Filipino remake in 2011. The telenovela has stood the test of time and gained a cult show status, mainly due to the cast's comically melodramatic performance driven by unrealistic plot twists, particularly in regard to the supporting role of Soraya Montenegro, a wealthy and evil relative of the De la Vega family portrayed by Itatí Cantoral. Online, the character has long been celebrated as the single most memorable antagonist of the series and one of the most iconic villains in Mexican telenovela history, with "best-of" montage tributes to Soraya Montenegro entering circulation on YouTube as early as May 2008. In October 2009, the live video game streaming site DopefishLives posted a clip from their playthrough of Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood in which the player came across a goat in the game. A glitch caused the goat to levitate towards the sky when the player got too close to it. In this instance, the player backed the goat up against a ladder, making it seem like the goat was climbing it. The original video clip was taken from the film The Goddess Bunny [1] which is about the drag queen.[2] The film was released in 1998 and the clip was uploaded to eBaum's World [3] on July 3rd, 2006, where it has accrued over 250,000 views as of March 2021. It was later reuploaded to YouTube (shown below). The video features a distorted version of the "Itsy Bitsy Spider" song and different visual and audio effects.   Based on the Dr. Wily's Castle stage theme and rearranged by "Blue Fang" (蒼い牙 Aoi Kiba), the song describes the singer reminiscing about his childhood and friends while realizing his life and theirs is nothing like what it used to be. Published in 1988 by Capcom for the Nintendo Entertainment System, Mega Man 2 is the second installment in the Mega Man series. Both a critical and commercial success, one of the most highly praised features of the game was its high quality soundtrack, with one of the most recognizable tracks being the backgroundmusic accompanying the storming of the evil Dr. Wily's Fortress. As evidence of its popularity, the song was ranked in the second place on ScrewAttack's list of the 10 greatest video game themes.[1]  On April 7th of 2010, the company Nike released an ad in which Tiger Woods simply stares into a camera while audio of his father--Earl Woods--asking questions is playing in the background. The advertisement was later cited to be a shameful and exploitative use of his late father's voice. However, it was later discovered that his father's questions were not even directed towards Tiger originally- it was actually taken from an ABC interview with him in 2004, and the "Tiger" at the beginning of the advertisement is actually supposed to be his wife's name, Kutilda (Source).  Originally from the japanese gameshow: no Minasan no Okage deshita (とんねるずのみなさんのおかげでした) it depicts a contest where participants have to make a shape with their bodies in order to cross a wall that approaches to them with a hole. The estrange game gained notoriety through the internet where several clips were upload. The clips were extremely popular since they contained some of the most common traits likely to the internet geek community: japanese culture, awkwardness and a resemblance to a popular videogame, making them a series, the most popular has 10 million views: But there are more cases of videos with millions of views, this for instance has 8 million: 3 million video: 1 million: On November 5 2007 a segment called: "Tru the wall or take a fall" on the Ellen Degeneres Show featured the game, the contest was repeated days later. This was done in the height of the internet popularity and before that the rights of the game were sold to western countries so Ellen did not had to pay royalties. It is most likely that the Ellen staff meet the game through the internet.  On April 6th, 2010, the music video for Insane Clown Posse's 2009 single "Miracles" made its on YouTube, where it was met with immediate Internet acclaim and quoted in forums as well as internet humor blogs. As of April 6th, 2017, the music video has received more than 17 million views on YouTube.  In 2005, the Something Awful forums hosted a contest in which a blue ball machine was to be created. While no specific instructions were provided for creating the instances, hundreds of SomethingAwful forum goons posted small GIF animations in which blue balls ran through a small portion of a virtual Rube Goldberg machine. These were eventually compiled together into a large collage of GIFs (as shown below) and spawned dozens of derivatives on YTMND, some of which went on to become the most viewed pages of all time within the community. On March 20th, 2010, the Youtube account Unicornpp was created and the video Unicorn After Wisdom Teeth was uploaded. "Pythagora Switch" ("Pitagora Suitchi") is a Japanese show similar to "Sesame Street", designed to teach toddler-age children about various concepts. The show has just enough of that Japanese quirkiness or extravagance that numerous clips from the show have found themselves to sites like YouTube and appreciated by Western audiences. Besides Algorithm March, the show has led to distribution of videos of other elements from the show, such as the "Pythagora Switch" bumpers and interstitial, generally short cute Rube Goldberg machines that end with a flag with the show's name, and simple animations using a fixed number of lines to tell a story. One part of the show featured the Algorithm March, a participatory song that describes actions that should be taken as the singer sang it. The song (along with several "Algorithm" variants) was written, sung, and performed in part by the Japanese comedy duo, Itsumo Kokokara. The Algorithm March was specifically designed to be sung in a canon/round by a line of people in the song; done correctly, the actions of one person would just miss hitting someone next to them or would enhance the actions of the persons adjacent to them. In the show, this is generally presented as "Individual Algorithm March", where one person would sing and perform, and then a second segment where all others would join in. Numerous variations on the theme have been created from the show; for example, the below video shows "Algorithm March with Ninjas", but other versions from the show include bus drivers, tour guides, and international football players.   The photo was taken by California resident Maureen Ravelo[3], Riley's owner, in February 2010. She posted it on her personal Facebook account where her friend, John Lipari[1] saw it. He posted the photo to Reddit[2] on February 23rd, 2010, where it received 6,112 upvotes and 3,326 points overall. Many of the comments pointed out the dog's smile and half-shut eyes, which made the animal appear to be under the influence of marijuana. On July 31, 2006, OK Go uploaded the music video for their song "Here It Goes Again". (the video below is one of several re-uploads of the video. The original video has disabled embedding.)  The mispronunciation of MMORPG as "Meuporg" was first quoted by French TV journalist Nathanaël de Rincquesen in a France 2 news report about the concerns of video game addiction, particularly with popular MMORPGs such as Ultima Online and World of Warcraft. Unaware of its conventional pronunciation, Rincquesen misread the term as a single word, as in "Meuporg," and later misspelled the initialism as "MMMPORPG" during the broadcast, rendering himself highly exploitable to the French audiences and video game fans on the web (shown below). On March 18th, 2010, shortly after the airing of the news program, YouTuber Blakkos uploaded a clip of the segment[1]. The video gained more than 215,000 views in the first two weeks.  In May 2008, David DeVore took his seven-year-old son, David DeVore Jr., to a dental surgeon to take care of an extraneous tooth that was caused by hyperdontia.[1] Since his mother Tessa could not make it, DeVore decided to film David before and after the procedure to show her later. After the surgery was completed, DeVore filmed David's reaction, in which he asked deep questions including "is this real life?" "Why is this happening to me?" and "Is this going to be forever?" After sharing it with his family and friends on Facebook, DeVore uploaded it to YouTube[3] on January 30th, 2009. Within three days, the video had 3 million views.[4] As of April 20th, 2012, the video has 109,979,313 views, an average of 93,520 views a day, and 1,742,940 shares on Facebook.[5]  While becoming popular on 2chan, and then crossing over to 4chan, Waha~ is a fanart image of a character named 'Suzuran' from a hentai game called 'Suigetsu'. The reason she is called 'Waha~' is because she yelled it out after every one of her lines in the game. (source) The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson first aired October 1st, 1962. Prior to Carson's appearance on each episode, Ed McMahon would announce "and now, heeeeeere's Johnny!" (example shown below). The line became well known in pop culture and was famously referenced in Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. In the film, Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrance hacks down a door with an axe. Once there is a hole large enough for his face, he sticks his head through and sinisterly says "here's Johnny!" (shown below). The scene would inspire future memes using the phrase. On November 6th, 2009, French YouTuber DaisYannou[1] uploaded a 37 second video of her cat, Rocky, standing on his hind legs in order to get a better look at something off camera. Although the viewer never sees what Rocky is looking at, he exhibits anthropomorphic behavior by standing like a biped and even raising his front right paw a couple of times almost as if he were gesturing. Paired with Yoko Kanno's song "Cats on Mars"[8] from the soundtrack of anime series Cowboy Bebop, the video gained over 7.2 million views and 4,600 comments over the next eight years.   Sgt. Hartman originally appeared in the 1987 war film Full Metal Jacket, which begins by following the experiences of a U.S. Marines platoon in boot camp under instructor Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, who verbally abuses the soldiers as part of their training (shown below).[1]  The video was uploaded by YouTuber Nec1 on November 25th, 2009 and was accompanied by a lengthy description with a fabricated back-story.      Christian was born in captivity in an Ilfracombe zoo, who gave the cub to a department store. Christian was soon purchased by John Rendall and Anthony Bourke, who took pity on the cub and raised it to the best of their abilities. They were allowed to exercise the cub at a local graveyard, but Christian soon grew much too large to be kept around. John and Anthony made the decision to integrate Christian into the wild at the Kora National Reserve, where, after a rocky start, Christian became the head of a pride just outside of Kora. The life of Christian became the subject of an Australian documentary called Christian, The Lion at World's End, which detailed the introduction of Christian to the wild and a subsequent reunion a year later. In 2002, a fansite (No clue what it was called… anyone know?) uploaded a clip of Christian's reunion with his former owners.          The line was originally featured in the game Shadow the Hedgehog, a darker take on the Sonic franchise featuring the popular character of the same name. The game was one of the first Sonic games to feature profanity, most evident in the constant use of the word "damn."[1] In one scene, Shadow says "Where's that damn fourth chaos emerald?" which was widely parodied after the game's release.[2]   The original upload has since been deleted, and another video was uploaded on March 27th, 2010 that was deleted as well. On February 25th, 2010, the following video was posted by boyuisthebad, however this does not seem to be the original either, since many other reuploads do not include the blatant advertising. An extension of the broader concept of Alternate Universe fan art, the term "Untoon" was coined by a graphic designer and blogger known as Jax Pixeloo[14] in early 2008. The first example was posted to Pixeloo's blog[1] on March 15th, 2008, depicting a hyperrealistic Super Mario (shown below). The art maintained Mario's large eyes and oversized mustache while making the character look more humanized.   In the original radio series of The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy, which aired on BBC Radio 4 in 1978, the supercomputer Deep Thought is tasked with coming up with the the "answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything." After 7.5 million years of painstaking calculations, the computer reveals that answer to be the number 42, however, it fails to explain the meaning because it does not know "the ultimate question." As a result, the Earth is built as a second supercomputer to provide the ultimate question. On November 3rd, 1993, the author of the book Douglas Adams explained the reasoning behind choosing the number 42 as the answer to the ultimate questions in a Usenet discussion thread in alt.fan.douglas-adams[2]: "The answer to this is very simple. It was a joke. It had to be a number, an ordinary, smallish number, and I chose that one. Binary representations, base thirteen, Tibetan monks are all complete nonsense. I sat at my desk, stared into the garden and thought '42 will do' I typed it out. End of story."        Alpha Kenny Body and other deliberate mondegreen's such as "I am sofa king we Todd Ed" (I am so fucking retarded) have existed for years. The UrbanDictionary entry for Alpha Kenny Body was first posted in November of 2007. One of the initial and most viewed prank videos was uploaded January 8, 2010 by video blogger Frida Rose who successfully pranked her mom into saying the phrase. The majority of views on the video are accredited to Facebook links and sharing and have surpassed half a million views within seven months of the initial upload. In the description, Rose claims to have received the idea for the prank from another video uploaded July 1, 2009. The major contributor to the spread is video blogger and comedian Kevin Wu AKA KevJumba when he pranked his dad with the phrase on a video uploaded April 29, 2010. Season 1, episode 2 of the show Community aired in September of 2009, and was titled "Spanish 101". During the closing credis, Abed (Danny Pudi) and Troy (Donald Glover) perform a freestyle rap using rhyming Spanish words that do not form coherent sentences. Swaby recorded the music video for "Pardon Me" in 1999 with assistance from then college students Tim Constable and Patrick McNeill. Althoug the video was produced on a 50£ budget and was never meant for public release, it was uploaded on YouTube by user Vanillapod on January 19th, 2010:  The Spycrab trend gained initial popularity in mid-2008. The earliest video recordings of Team Fortress 2 players performing the animation trick were posted on YouTube in early July 2008. On July 5th, 2008, YouTube[1] user Zealot uploaded a video titled "Spy Crabs" that received over 340,000 views in 13 years (shown below, left). On July 6th, 2008, YouTube[2] user Kilorat posted a video that gained over 766,000 views in the same period (shown below, right). In Kilorat's video, the Spy player has "RARE ENDAGERED CRAB SPY" as nickname, with the phrase becoming associated with the meme.   Probably the first occurrence of a Jumpstyle mashup appeared on YouTube in January 2007 when user roykeetels upload a video of Borat (Sacha Baron Cohen) doing some crazy moves at a popular Dutch show Jensen, paired with the Jumpstyle song "Just A Melody" by Chicago Zone:    On February 27th, 1996, Pokémon Red and Pokémon Green were released in Japan.[1] In the game, Gary Oak[2] or "Blue Oak" as he is known in the games, is the main player's rival. He appears at the most inopportune moments: right after a series of difficult battles, or at the end of a very long level (clip below). On April 1st, 1997, the anime adaptation of Pokémon premiered. In the series, Gary regularly trolled Ash, the main character (clip below). In 2008, Anonymous posted the following thread on /v/ (link to the 4chan archive WARNING NSFW) It was about Crab Nicholson's extreme sleepover text adventures, as the current developers say "the most epic text based adventure of all time" The videogame boxart was based on the following picture: The game became quickly popular on 4chan, and soon, some teams actually started developing the game for PC, but got too bored. The original command lines from the team can be found on crabnicholson.blogspot.com In August of 2009, independent musician Renard composed a theme song to be accompanied with the original game, including a detailed box art: Nothing was heard from the crabs in the following months, but in January 2010, a new team started developing the game, and on January 27, nearly a year and a half after the original thread, the first beta of the game, built 0,001 was released. The current version as for Thursday the 25th of March is 0.005  The scene originates from the later part of Death Note episode 37 "New World", and was originally aired on June 26th, 2007. Light attempts to kill Near by writing his name on a piece of the Death Note hidden in his watch. Before he can, Light is shot several times by Matsuda[1]. Light shows epic death cry and maneuver in agony.      This song is written by Jun Ishikawa, the main composer of Kirby series. According to Nico Nico Pedia[2], an internet encyclopedia for NND, this song began to be used in MADs on NND in the first half in 2008. And the first video that led to a substantial increase in popularity of the series was "Kirby of the Star : Super Misao Deluxe" (星のカービィ　スーヴァーみさおデラックス) posted to NND on May 16th, 2008.[3] This video features the Japanese anime Lucky Star[4], and its title based on the Japanese original title of Kirby Super Star. In addition, Because this song was also played in the other stage "Sky High Planet", This song and its video series became to be called Sky High as a popular name among NND users. On August 20th, 2009, the video was first uploaded online by Nico Nico Douga[2] user あしトコ and mirror-uploaded by YouTuber SeriouslyPissedOff on the following day (shown below). In the following four years, the Nico Nico Douga upload gained over 1.26 million views and the YouTube upload garnered more than 3.61 million views.   On Sunday, March 20th, 2010 the Congress of the United States passed the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010, a polarizing but monumental piece of legislation regarding health care in the U.S. Three days later, at the White House ceremony to sign the bill into law, Vice President Joe Biden introduced President Barack Obama before a packed room and a live television audience. During the applause, Biden whispered to Obama that the legislation was "a big fucking deal." This statement was picked up by the microphones and broadcast live over radio and television.  The word 'Makmende' has a pre-internet origin. It is a Swahili slang word that originally came from a popular 1983 Clint Eastwood movie, Sudden Impact. In it, Eastwood's 'Dirty Harry' character holds a criminal at gunpoint, daring him to give Harry a reason to shoot him saying, "Go ahead, make my day." This was mistranslated to "Mek ma nday" and used to refer to anyone who thought they were tough or a wannabe superhero. Cultural ethnographer Ethan Zuckerman describes it in a blog post: In March 2010, the Kenyan music group 'Just a Band' created a music video for their song 'Ha-He' where a street hero named 'Makmende' single-handedly takes on a city's worst criminals through his mastery of kung-fu. The look and feel of the video emulates the blaxploitation movies of the 1970s like Shaft and Superfly. It uses lots of freeze-frames and Makmende is dressed in the style of the time with bell bottom pants and a huge afro. While the history of redactive composition may as well predate the Internet, Redactive Poetry Project was founded by a group of students in an intellectual property class at New York University in March 2010. From the Blog: At approximately 9:22 pm on March 17th, 2010, a post appeared on 2channel's /news4vip/ (Breaking news: VIP) board with an image of a slackjawed cat: My cat's chin is about to fall out. I tried Googling for advice, but can't find anything useful. Hospital is closed. What should I do? If anyone's had a similar experience, post reply. In addition to sharing images of Chocolate on 2channel, the user uploaded a video of the cat to Nico Nico Douga[1] and YouTube[2] the same day. According to the original poster, the kitten was suffering from a dislocated jaw when the pictures and videos were taken. Many comments were sympathetic, while noting that the cat looked hilarious.  Video game griefer Britbong[4] claims to have created the Ralph Pootawn character while he was a member of the group W-Hat in Second Life to avoid having his main account banned. He then posted several screenshots of his trolling exploits on 4chan's /b/ (random) board in late 2009, where they initially gained traction.[5] Some have disputed Britbong's claims, saying he has yet to provide evidence that he owns the original Ralph Pootawn account.   The colloquial Spanish phrase "me gusta" was first adopted into a Rage Comic drawing by illustrator May Oswald (formerly known as Matt), who uploaded her artwork to 4chan [5] and Reddit [6] on March 18th, 2010. The drawing was also uploaded to her personal Tumblr blog[3] and DeviantART[4] account. During our interview with Oswald on May 6th, 2021, she revealed that the original post to 4chan was a carefully constructed effort to get the meme to go viral, which she did by posting examples of the face in memes from various accounts and IP addresses.[13] Here was the plan. Oftentimes, when a new Rage Face was coming out in 4chan at that time, how the thread would happen is that there would just be the face, and then with the colorful language of 4chan, there would be the equivalent of, "Hey, new Rage Face just dropped. See what you guys can make of it." So my intention was to do the exact same thing, "Hey, new Rage Face just dropped." Post the image. But what I came in with was that I had made about two or three example comics to kind of get it out there with sort of what I was intending this face to be used for. The first meme featuring Me Gusta after Oswald's initial post to 4chan used the character in a four-panel comic with a cat reacting to being pet, which Oswald revealed in our interview was actually a meme she made herself (shown below). Oswald eventually revealed herself as the creator of the Me Gusta face in a Reddit thread,[1] as well as an Ask Me Anything (AMA) thread[2] on March 8th, 2011. The earliest known instance of Dancing Stormtrooper appeared on Cookie Thievery[1] on June 28th, 2004. The site showed a man fully geared in Stormtrooper armor doing the pelvic thrust over and over in loop to the Imperial March. On October 10th, 2004, YTMND user Xenetic posted an animated GIF of the original clip titled Stormtrooper Victory Dance[2], set to the background track of Joe Esposito's "You're the Best Around," which was originally on the Karate Kid soundtrack. Over the next year or two, the GIF animation became a popular YTMND site and spawned a modest number of derivative sites.[3] During this time, the footage also earned the nickname "Stormhumper." According to KYM researcher nmcandrew: The original illustration of crazy Ronald McDonald reading the Death Note (ですのーと) was drawn by Japanese amateur illustrator Masao (Japanese: マサオ), which was uploaded to his website[1] and the Japanese parody illustration hub site Asame Graph[2] in August 2006. The remark in a speech balloon, "Achopu Mau Mau" (アチョプマウマウ), is the characteristic groan of Gonzui, the protagonist in a Japanese manga Kaijin Gonzui (海人ゴンズイ, lit."Ocean Human Gonzui") written by George Akiyama.[3], used to convey a feeling of madness.    "Trapped in the Closer" is a critically-acclaimed episode from the 9th season of South Park. The episode revolves around Scientology, centering on Stan being considered the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard by the group, and thus exalted as their leader. As such, several scenes of the episode are used to explain the teachings of Scientology – which itself involves some rather strange concepts. As both Matt Stone and Trey Parker are vocal opponents of Scientology, this was given with as much seriousness as they could give it, with the text "THIS IS WHAT SCIENTOLOGISTS ACTUALLY BELIEVE" shown over the images. The episode, unsurprisingly, was met with controversy from Scientology, leading to "Closetgate" that only served to heighten interest in the episode, and Isaac Hayes' departure from the show. The episode was nominated for an Emmy that year, but lost to The Simpsons.   The word itself started appearing in 2003, with UrbanDictionary entries for several different spellings. In January 2003 there was sheeee-it!, April brought about sheeeeeeeit and sheeet. In October, sheee-it appeared. Finally, November saw sheeeit added, minus the hyphen. The word did not appear on The Wire until season three, which originally aired from September to December 2004. The first character to say it was Erv in Season 3, Episode 3. The episode originally aired October 3, 2004. In Season 4, Episode 2, Sheeeee-it was politician Clay Davis' response to being served with a subpoena by the Baltimore Police Department. It originally aired September 10, 2006. After this episode, Clay Davis would repeat the word throughout the rest of the series as a response to bad news. However, The Wire was not the first time Isiah Whitlock Jr. had used Sheeeee-it on screen. In 2002, he appeared as a special agent in the Spike Lee movie 25th Hour and used it before arresting Edward Norton's drug-dealing character.      On January 29th, 2010, GameTrailers, a video game news site well known for its abundance of trailers and reviews, released the first preview of gameplay footage from the-then upcoming interactive drama action-adventure PS3 video game Heavy Rain. The clip begins with the opening prologue wherein the main protagonist character Ethan Mar is shown spending time with his family at a shopping mall to celebrate his elder son Jason's 10th birthday. When Jason suddenly wanders off and disappears into the crowd, Ethan frantically searches for him, and at 0:36 in the video, the player is prompted with the action command "Press X to Jason" in order to shout at Jason and draw his attention (shown below). The awkwardly-worded prompt is an example of quick time events, a type of game mechanics which requires the player to press a specific button or key at the right time time in order to complete a minor task, that are extensively featured throughout the game. Compounded by other quirks and glitches present in the trailer, including awkward voice acting and odd CG facial animation, the phrase "Press X to Jason" soon became an easy target for mockeries online. The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil[1] is the 6th game in the series but the first to be released for the Microsoft Windows operating system in 2002. U.N Owen was her? (U.N.オーエンは彼女なのか？) is the theme of the Extra Stage Boss, Flandre Scarlet. As a result, the song's name is often referred to as "Flandre's theme." The song was originally composed by ZUN, the creator of the Touhou project. The name "U.N. Owen" is an allusion to character names in the 1939 detective fiction novel And Then There Were None written by Agatha Christie. In the book, Ulick Norman Owen and Una Nancy Owen are a couple who host a dinner party on an island, albeit being absent throughout the night. Their names, which are shortened as "U.N. Owen," can be read as a pun and a homophone for "unknown."   The original post originated from 4chan's /v/ (video games) board and was posted on March 10th, 2010.    On January 3rd, 2010, a Youtube user named BenderAKAUnder made a video called AN UNTITLED METALOCALYPSE REFERENCE VIDEO, where the character Heavy is wearing a black t-shirt and the soldier was re-skinned to look like Dr. Rockzo, the rock and roll clown that does cocaine from the hit TV show Metalocalypse. In the video, Heavy says, "Kill Soldier!" and Pyro characters kick the soldier on the ground (similar to what the guards did to Dr. Rockzo in the birthdayklok episode of Metalocalypse). It was a very short and simple video. but it was never intended to start a fad. The video was a response to SCOUT IS DELICIOUS video by ARMaster. This video received over 38,000 views. It didn't become very popular until Youtube user RubberFruit made a response to the video with his Penis Cupcake character. After that video was posted, more derivatives were made. In 1989, a 64-year old woman moved in to a house 6 meters (20 feet) away from Miyoko's home in the Heguri, Nara Prefecture in Japan. Miyoko became angry when her neighbor did not officially greet her after moving in. Starting in November 2002, she spent over 2 years playing music as loud as possible nearly 24 hours a day through a portable stereo aimed at her neighbor's house. She also set out to annoy the neighbor in other ways. She would honk her car horn, shine bright lights in the other house's direction and would pat a rug on her balcony while yelling things like "Hikkoshi! Hikkoshi! Sassato Hikkoshi! Shibakuzo!" (引越ーし！引越ーし！ さっさと引越ーし！ しばくぞ！！; lit. Move away! Move away! Move away immediately! or slap you!), and "Kougi Simāsu!" (抗議しまーす！; lit. I make a protest (against you)!). The videos below are the neighbor's recordings that aired on the news channels in Spring 2005. This first one is a video compilation was first created and uploaded by the staff of conbinibento.com.[2] This other video compilation shows the neighbor's many other recordings that were also aired on the news channels. This other video compilation contains some of the neighbor's recordings of Miyoco's boombox playing a few songs that were played out loud against her neighbor. Miyoko's neighbor was able to capture video footage of her actions and sent them to news reporters and law enforcement. In April 2005, Miyoko was arrested for making excessively loud noise﻿ and inflicting injuries upon her neighbor a year later. Her arrest was covered in a blurb on Fox News[3] on April 13, 2005. On June 28th, 2005, The Japan Times[4] reported that she was pleading not guilty to the charges, claiming her music was "not too loud," despite the news report stating it was over 70 decibels during the day, when the environmental standard is 55. On October 8th, 2005, Miyoko was ordered to compensate her former neighbor 2 million yen in damages.[5] At the time, the fine would have been the equivalent of $17,418.57 in the US. In April 2006, Judge Tetsuya Okuda ruled that Miyoko "had not shown any remorse and could commit similar crimes again," according to Japundit.com[6], and was sentenced to a year in prison.[7]  The "Pumpkin Dance" segment originally aired during the 10 o'clock nightly newscast on Omaha, Nebraska's local news station KXVO[1] on October 31st, 2006. In a last-ditch effort to fill the 22 minutes of programming, Matt Geiler, then-the anchor of the KXVO primetime news program, performed a live improvised dance to the Ghostbusters theme song,[2] while wearing a pumpkin mask and a black unitard, in front of a CGI graveyard backdrop. On November 2nd, 2006, one of the producers at the station uploaded the clip to KXVO's official YouTube channel.  Unknown and Researching    On August 12th, 2005, YTMND user joshawow[1] created a site titled Butt Racing[2] with a stop motion GIF of a young woman appearing as if she was spinning around in circles on asphalt with her arms outstretched as if she was grabbing a steering wheel (shown below). The GIF was paired with Marko Polo's song "Speedy Speed Boy" from the soundtrack of the anime series Initial D. As of August 2013, it has been viewed more than 37,000 times. On the morning of January 30th, 2010, a photographer took his new Sony video camcorder to Tian Yi Square and decided to try out the new lens by shooting street scenes for the photography community forum Fengniao. The photographer, Mr. Tu, captured a few shots of a homeless man, who he said was "bearing dignification" as he walked down the busy streets. "He has a very special temperament," stated Mr. Tu, "so I couldn't help but pick up the camera and take a few shots." Later that day, Mr. Tu went home and sent his photos to the website, but did not expect to receive any significant attention.  The exact origin of this phrase is debatable, as there are numerous possible sources contributing to it; it is most likely that this phrase was already used to a small degree off-line, but became widespread both because of a comment made by Chef Gordon Ramsay (which sparked the sentiment, but did not state it or necessarily support it) and through inclusions of its variations in popular media, such as in the Batman Beyond episode, "Hooked Up". The video, "Batman Beyond: GET BACK IN THE KITCHEN" has 876,621 views as of January 17th, 2017. The dancing scene was originally featured in the 1990 Tamil film Adhisaya Piravi, a Kollywood romance comedy starring Rajinikanth and Kanaka. Mother: Hey, hey. What's with the party early in the morning. Everyone go away, shoo, shoo. (Speaking to Rajinikanth, who's lying on the cot) Why not take some rest, dear. Rajinikanth: OK, Mom (lights up a cigarette as she walks away). Thavakalai: Dude, give me a cigarette. Rajinikanth: Hey! Kids shouldn't smoke. Thavakalai: Buddy, I'm ten years older than you. Give it to me I say. Rajinikanth: And if I don't? Thavakalai: I'll skin you alive. Rajinikanth: Here you go.        In "The Fellowship of the Ring," Gandalf utters the phrase as he blocks the path of Balrog Demon in pursuit. The quote has been celebrated by both the readers of the trilogy as well as the fans of the film adaptation: Gandalf: You cannot pass! I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the Flame of Anor. The dark fire will not avail you, Flame of Udun! Go back to the shadow. You shall not pass! Although not directly correlated, the phrase may have been inspired by the saying "They Shall Not Pass!" that became popular among the French soldiers during World War II, mostly as a propaganda slogan used to express determination to defend a position against an enemy.     On September 18, 2005, YTMND user Fooliano created the site Indiana Jones Can't Stop the Rock. To date, this site has more than 500,000 views, putting it on the third page of YTMND's most viewed sites of all time, and has become a YTMND mod favorite. Reflecting its community-wide popularity, the song "Stop the Rock" was also featured on Volume IV of the YTMND soundtrack. Meanwhile, the original scene from the movie was inspired by "The Seven Cities of Cibola," an Uncle Scrooge comic drawn by Carl Banks. Apparently, the boulder used in the scene was made of fiberglass and was 22 feet in diameter. It originated from the Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog show on the episode Sonic's Christmas Blast.  Accoding to Nico Nico Pedia[4], an internet encyclopedia for the Japanese video sharing service Nico Nico Douga (NND), the first instance of the meme was posted on NND in November 30th, 2007, featuring Miss Hisamoto in an interview clip with the music set to Kirby's Gourmet Race soundtrack. This MAD video was titled as "久本雅美の頭がカービィのBGMに合わせて爆発したようです。".[5] This is also the trigger video of the MAD series for Kirby's Gourmet Race Remixes on NND. The original was removed, but the info (including upload date and scrolling text) was left. The video was later re-uploaded with the same title on July 5, 2008[6] and again on May 10, 2009[7]. More info about the removal in the "Spread" section. In the original interview, Miss Hisamoto gives an emotional account of how happy she felt when Daisaku Ikeda (the current leader of SGI) praised the actress for her TV performances. Out of sheer joy, she then exclaimed “PAN!” (or "PARN!" as seen in many related MADs) with hands over her face, rendering herself quite exploitable for remix artists on NND. NeoGAF users first learned about the U R MR GAY message in a thread discussing video game "box art of the year"[11]. Discussion of this particular game's title continued in its own dedicated thread, titled "Super Mario Galaxy boxart says you're gay"[4], on September 18, 2007. Aspiring rapper T-Baby wrote the song "It's So Cold in the D" to commemorate the memory of her friend Mason Graham, who was shot and killed at a restaurant in Coney Island in 2006. The video was recorded in October 2007 in Detroit by videographer Leo WIlliams on a budget of $300.[2] It was uploaded to YouTube by pwltf on January 3rd, 2008 and has accrued more than 5.8 million views and 19,000 dislikes as of November 2012. On September 22nd, 1993, the Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog episode "Boogey-Mania" premiered in the United States.[1] At one point in the episode, Dr. Robotnik catches his robotic minions Scratch and Grounder eavesdropping on his conversation ("Snooping as usual, I see!").  Final Placement[1] consists of four band members (Jacob and Collin on guitars, Jarrett on bass, and Josh on drums) from Midland Christian School in Midland, Texas. According to the band's site description: The original video was posted via Vimeo sometime in mid-February 2010 by user Sharityworld.[2] By March 2nd, the video had gained 14,800 views, but was deleted from the site on March 19th. A duplicate version of the video was uploaded by Vimeo user F.P. Shine[3] on March 1st. As of June 10th, 2010, this version had gained 14,400 views.     On January 26th, 2010, the second entry in the Mass Effect series of video games, Mass Effect 2, was released in North America. Early in the game, the player character Commander Shepard is given the option to advertise for their favorite store to get discounts from it. If the player chooses to do so, Shepard is recorded by the shop clerk saying, "I'm Commander Shepard, and this is my favorite store on the citadel." The player can do this at multiple stores, resulting in the audio clip playing whenever you enter one, humorously making it appear as if Shepard endorses every store as their favorite. On February 4th, 2010, YouTuber[1] DigBickPlaya uploaded footage of the scene, garnering over 130,000 views in 11 years (shown below).    The first instance of "thrust vectoring owns the sky" goes back to November 2003, which makes it one of the earliest catchphrases to be widely recognized by the now infamous hubsite. According to several witness accounts, the quote came from an Anonymous post on 4chan's /p/ (photography) imageboard circa November 2003. It was initially posted as a comment on a picture of a F/A-22 Raptor, and then later placed next to pictures of other aircraft or vehicles, but was also seen on marques.   Dustin Browder used the term several times in the Sonkie vs Yellow match at BlizzCon 2008 and used it again during Battle Report 2 and at the BlizzCon 2009 exhibition match. The phrase is so popular that it has even been proposed as a StarCraft II cheat code. The phrase is most often used by Dustin in battle reports in association with David Kim, the lead balance developer, who has won every battle report and seems to easily beat all his opponents, even top professional players. Leading Starcraft fans to joking ask Blizzard to nerf David Kim.    Tony Kornheiser is an American sportswriter and talk show host who is best known as the host of his radio program The Tony Kornheiser Show and the co-host of ESPN’s Pardon the Interruption. According to Encyclopedia Dramatica,[2] the original image of Kornheiser was uploaded on 4chan’s /sp/ board in late 2009, featuring a stillshot of Kornheiser and Michael Wilbon debating the Indianapolis Colts’ decision to rest Peyton Manning in a game against the New York Jets during an episode of Pardon The Interruption. Across the bottom of the screen, the partially visible lower third caption read “Why did the Colts give up?” (shown below). The juxtaposition of Kornheiser’s self-complacent facial expression with the word ‘WHY’ instantly came off as unexpected and humorous, soon derailing the thread from the original topic to photoshopping Kornheiser’s face onto other pictures   LNRG originated in a comic produced on 4chan's /v/ which some refer to as "Cum, Hisao!" that mocks the twisted Japanese "cripple fetish" hentai games. The specific game is Katawa Shoujo, a dating game in which the player is able to romance a number of women with crippling disfigurations (it must be pointed out that the game is actually developed by 4chan users). In the comic, a person playing Katawa Shoujo recoils away from his screen in horror after his player character ejaculates on a female character while shouting, "Ima rub my cum in yo burn scars!" The original "recoil" image began to be posted as a reaction image, with the neck beginning to be drawn progressively longer in each one.  The game was produced by Spiritonin Media Games and released online by Adult Swim on February 4th, 2010. In the game, the player takes control of a robotic unicorn galloping across a land made of purple grass, rainbows and sparkling dolphins. The objective of the game is to continue gameplay without falling off the stage, crash into the edges of platforms or colliding with crystal stars. Points can be earned by leaping over obstacles and chasms, or bursting through stars using a "dash" move. The game also featured the 1994 synth pop song titled "Always" by English duo band Erasure. Upon its release, the game was met by positive feedback from various gaming communities and forums, most notably on 4chan's /v/ (video game) board where discussions about the appeal of the game continued for several days. Within the first week of launch, Robot Unicorn Attack broke through one million plays and became one of the most popular games featured on Adult Swim. As a result of its popularity, the official music video of "Always" by Erasure on YouTube saw a significant increase in viewership throughout early 2010.     The phrase originates from the sci-fi action RPG game Mass Effect 2 that was originally released in January 2010. In the game, one of the primary enemy units known as "Harbinger," a highly advanced mechanical warship capable of mind-controlling certain enemy units, frequently says things like "I am assuming control of this form" or "direct intervention is necessary." Similar to other gaming-related phrases like you must construct additional pylons and cake is a lie, "assuming direct control" quickly gained notoriety within the fanbase and the very deep, unintentionally comical voice by Keith Szarabajka. This idea grew into a fad among many forum posts, where someone would interrupt a sentence to say one of Harbinger's lines. Several user accounts have pointed to 4chan's /v/ board as the birthplace of "assuming (direct) control" as an interrupter, but it still remains debatable without any support of visual evidence.  The first pictures were uploaded to the web through by a twitter user called "Noure_Azadi", in the beginning of February 2010, and re-twitted by some of his followers. The lost cast can be seen here wearing green, like the protesters in Iran, and the map of the country is also shown in green. Another one of the first examples: The series' cast is replaced here by the cast of the leadership of Iran: President Ahmedinejad in the left, and the Supreme Leader Khamenei in the right".   The phrase predates its internet usage. According to online discussions, the phrase has roots in popular culture, one of the earliest notable mentions came from American standup comedian Paula Poundstone who used the phrase in her 1990 HBO stand-up special Cats, Cops and Stuff.[1][2] During the special, Poundstone tells a childhood story about dropping a Flintstones jelly-jar glass in the kitchen. Her mother responds to the accident, "Oh, so we can't have nice things." In the 1998 film Jane Austen's Mafia!, the character Tony (portrayed by Jay Mohr) says the line during an argument with his significant other (shown below). The image macros began gaining momentum in 2007. On December 4th, 2007, LiveJournal[3] user foxbaby posted the earliest available version of the meme (shown below).  The AC Transit Bus fight video was uploaded onto YouTube by Iyanna Washington on Februrary 16th, 2010. In the video, Thomas Bruso and another passenger simply known as Michael can be heard arguing about something before breaking into a fistfight, during which Michael suffers multiple blows to his face and eventually yells out for someone to call "an ambulance." However, due to his impeded speech (presumably caused by the injury) and ambient background noises, his call for "an ambulance" was misheard by many viewers as "an M&M" or "Amber Lamps." Meanwhile, some viewers took notice of a fashionably dressed young woman casually sitting in the background, who didn't seem to pay much attention to the altercation that unfolded only a few feet away her seat. Soon, 4chan users began posting close-up screenshots of the mysterious passenger with the nickname "Amber Lamps." On the popular website Chatroulette.com, you sit in front of your webcam until the system connects you with a random stranger, much like the site Omegle. In an instant, you see yourself faced with a complete stranger, and it takes just a few seconds for one of two things to happen. Either the stranger will start the online chat, or the stranger will "next" you by hitting the F9 button on the top of the keyboard. This website connecting with the button spawned a new use of the internet phrase F9, where it had previously meant "fine", when used in an online chat room or forum.    On February 16th, 2010, Iyanna Washington, a college student from Oakland, CA (YouTube user "iyannaw08") uploaded a video titled "AC TRANSIT BUS FIGHT I AM A MOTHERFUCKER." It featured footage she recorded of a 50 year old black man and a 67 year old white man wearing a T-shirt that reads "I AM A MOTHERFUCKER" having a heated argument fueled by racial ignorance resulting in a violent physical confrontation (shown below, left). That same day, Iyanna Washington uploaded another video footage capturing the aftermath of the fight, with Bruso continuing to throw a tantrum in the street after stepping out of the bus (shown below, right). Originating from the /a/ (anime) board of 4chan, QUALITY captions are typically attached to screenshots of anime or manga scans that are distorted, poorly drawn, or horribly inadequate. The "in-between" animation shots that transition from key frame to key frame are usually the prime source of the faulty images. The secondary source being "farming out" to cheap animators or artists. QUALITY often depicts characters/scenes which are drawn with facial distortions, choppy and/or inconsistent animation sequences. It may also be a part of the animation, or even the physics behind it.    Sony's third-generation console PlayStation 3 (PS3) was first introduced at the 2005 Electronic Entertainment Expo and launched in November 2006 along with 14 new titles. Grievances about the perceived lack of PS3 titles began surfacing in 2007 with the so-called "console war" between XBOX 360 players and PlayStation 3 players that often led to pros-and-cons discussions on gaming blogs[2] and forums[3] over which console was deemed the superior, similar to the online debates surrounding Mac vs. PC. Some of the main points put forth by pro-Xbox 360 commentators include better a better online service in the form of Xbox Live and a controller better suited for shooter video-games whist pro-PS3 arguers tend to cite free-of-charge online service, better graphics on exclusives games and use of Blu-ray as a game format as its advantages. As of May 2013, there are at least 772 titles available for the Sony PlayStation 3, whereas its competitors Microsoft Xbox 360 and Nintendo Wii offer more than 1,000 and 1,200 titles respectively.  Crysis was released on November 13th, 2007[1] by Crytek and Electronic Arts, and was developed on the (then) latest version of the CryEngine, which also powered Crytek's first title, FarCry. It was amongst the first games to ever utilize Microsoft's DirectX 10 API framework, which required Windows Vista or later. Other feats prided by the Crytek developers was the game being created with over 1 million lines of code, utilization of over 1 GB of texture data, and up to 85,000 active shaders. Since it's release, Crysis has received universal acclaim, hailing it as the first true next-gen gaming experience, with a Metacritic[2] aggregated score of 91 and multiple game of the year awards.   One of the earliest uses of the phrase comes from the bit-tech.net[3] article on the game posted December 15th, 2009, stating that "The question 'Yeah, but can it play Crysis?' [has become] a comical catchphrase addition to most graphics card reviews." The article also questions the necessity of such taxing features on the game at release, and if this was a step in the right direction for gaming.   The Oregon Trail[1] is a resource-management game developed in 1971 in Minnesota by student teachers at Carleton College. The game is based on the eponymous journey taken by pioneers westward through the early days of American history, which was marked by dangerous, time-intensive, and often unpredictable encounters along the way. In the game, a number of setbacks can befall the players, including diseases such as cholera and dysentery. One of the more common stock explanations for a character's death was death by dysentery, giving the phrase "You Have Died of Dysentery" a sense of permanence: Both the Apple II version and a sequel game were first released in 1978. A streamlined version called Oregon was released in the following year as part of an educational game package. The success of the 1979 release also led to its re-release in 1985 with improved graphics. The original Apple II version[2] of the game is available online for free play. Avenue Q, an adult-oriented parody of Sesame Street, is a Broadway musical where the primary "cast" of the show are all puppets manned by human puppeteers who are also part of the cast. The puppet characters are forced to deal with adult problems throughout the musical (such as dealing with racism, keeping a job and managing romantic relationships). The musical was first performed in 2002, reaching Broadway in mid-2003 and gaining significant media attention. "The Internet Is For Porn" song performed in the musical, sung by characters Katie Monster and Trekkie Monster, is the best-known portion from the play and the one used in memes. Throughout the song, Katie tries to explain the wonders of using the internet, while Trekkie continually butts in and asserts that at its core, the internet is for porn. Midway through the song, human characters join in to affirm Trekkie's claims, much to Katie's disgust. On November 20th, 2007, YouTuber[1] DaVinciReloaded uploaded a clip of the performance, garnering over 5.2 million views in 14 years (shown below).       On August 6th, 2005, a photo of a man with his chef costume was taken and posted on iStockPhoto.com. The photo would later be adopted by PMS International, who put it on the boxes of the Stay Fresh System bags under the name of "Chef Excellence."   In 2007, Japanese boy-band, NewS, sponsored for the clothing brand, 'Russ-K'. The phrase Nanikeidemonai translates to "Don't mind the system (style)", which is the brand's slogan. At the end of the video, they literally say: "No matter what style, it's RUSS-K." In addition to endorsing the line of clothing, the commercial was used to preview what is now their seventh single, Weeeek, a few days before the official release of the song. The commercial stars members in the order of appearance: Yamashita Tomohisa , Koyama Keiichiro , Kato Shigeaki, Masuda Takahisa, Nishikido Ryo and Tegoshi Yuya. There were several other commercials made during the production, each providing equal screen-time for the six group members. However, the final rendering stood out the most. In total, seven commercials were made in the Russ-K winter collection.   Exactly when the term "lollerskates" was first used is unknown, but the creator of the graphic Andrew S. contacted Know Your meme to share his story. Hi. I made the original lollerskates.gif. The original file is still online at http://www.doomworld.com/linguica/lollerskates.gif and the file info says it dates from Jan 8 2003 (which sounds right to me). The backstory is pretty dumb, I had downloaded a mouse-gesture program that included, among other things, a gesture that would type ":-D LOL :-D" when you did a "L" gesture if I remember correctly. I was on IRC constantly at the time and I started using the gesture a lot because it annoyed people and was therefore funny. Eventually I edited the gesture to say ":-D LOLLERSKATES :-D" and then later I edited it to be multiple lines with the ASCII man on the lollerskates. For some reason (presumably because I was bored) in January 2003 I made an animated GIF out of it. I'm not sure where the "lollerskates" expression came from originally but I know I didn't invent it. One of its earliest mention can be found in a January 2003 question from a alt.fan.dragonball Usenet talk. It shows that the "lollerskates" slang was used before. Another early instance (July 2003) can be found on the Finnish Kosto.org website [ Warning, potential NSFW content ahead ], here. As the Google insights show, "lollerskates" popularity seems to have been mostly influenced by the "Roflcopter" fame from the beginning of February 2004. According to Encyclopedia Dramatica, "what do" first appeared in 4chan summer 2009, although the exact date of original instance has not been confirmed.  The X cycle originated from the Sonic Cycle, which is thought to have found it's origins on the NeoGAF Forums.On April 7th, 2008, NeoGAF Forum user Baiano19 posted one of the earliest instances of The Sonic Cycle images, in Post #2269 in the thread (First?) Shots of Sonic Unleashed. The same day, the image was reblogged onto PlayAsia.com On January 18th, 2009, a Digg thread entitled Sonic and the Black Knight is TOTALLY the rebirth of Sonic made it to the Digg front page. Due to the enthusiastic tone of the title, a user named goldenhearted posted what was now exact copypasta. This is the typical sonic cycle these days 1. New info release of new Sonic game, people say it's gonna be Sonic's comeback. 2. More or less, hype is generated as info, screens, vids, etc. releases. 3. Game comes out, it ends up like mediocre-shit. People say nothing can save Sonic. 4. Go back to #1  Using text to create images has been around since the invention of the commercial typewriter in 1867. It even was an aspect of the plot of the 1954 short film Stamp Day For Superman. Below is a German video showing typewriter art created in the 1950s. ASCII Art on computers has been around since the 1960s. It was very popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s, where people used ASCII art on bulletin board systems because there was no way to embed images. It also appeared in underground art groups and webcomics over the years. One webcomic, ASCII Art Farts, began in 1999 and ran daily until 2003. In the 1990s, graphical browsing became possible, causing people to use ASCII art less throughout the web. However, it stayed popular in places where the font had to maintain a fixed width. Email, message boards, IRC, and online text-based RPGs (MUDs) were hubs for ASCII art activity. In the early 2000s, people began combining internet acronyms such as LOL, ROFL, and LMAO with words as a way to intensify responses. UrbanDictionary definitions for lollercoaster and lollerskates were added in 2003 and a definition for roflcopter was added in 2004. The original image comes from the hentai doujin "Tiny Boobs Giant Tits History" by Shiden Akira, originally published in 2008[1]. The "plot" revolves around a brother who insults his sister's small chest, only for the two to later make up over some "family funtime." Page 3 of an English scanlation by the translation group Rhapfan of the doujin was spammed on 4chan across multiple imageboards around 2008, most prominently in /v/, in an apparent attempt to force a meme with the line "Shut the fuck up you titty monster." Due to the frequent spammings, interest in the original doujin grew, which led to the discovery of the pose on page 4 (shown below, right).  One of the earliest examples can be found here, September 28th 2008, as a reply to Jonathan Coulton's blog posting 'UK Press Blitz!'.         One early segment of Stephen Colbert's The Colbert Report included two boards with slide-out nameplates. If a person or group ticked Colbert off for actions they took (directly towards Colbert or in general), he would add their name to the "On Notice" board. If the group continues the same action, they would eventually be moved to the "Dead To Me" board. (There are more exacting rules how names move between the boards explained here ). The "On Notice" and "Dead to Me" boards in action.    While the original post is no longer available, Know Your Meme user Stefan published the earliest known version of the meme on February 11th, 2010. The meme features a stick figure playing and winning a level in Guitar Hero (shown below). However, Know Your Meme users previously reported that the meme comes from the /b/ message board, with its earliest appearance being February 11th, 2010. The concept of OS-tan originates from a discussion about Windows ME, notorious for its instability and frequent system crashes in /b/ (Nijiura) boards in Futaba Channel (2chan). Reflecting such deficiencies of the operating system, ME-tan’s character can be summarized as a fickle, clumsy, troublesome girl. The first illustration of ME-tan was uploaded on August 6th, 2003. In OS-tan comics, the Windows girls sometimes are shown holding negi, or green onions. This is a Japanese pun on the popular Japanese firewall NEGiES, which is pronounced like negi. In the comics, they are used as a weapon or shield. On November 19th, 2009, the "Parisian Love" video was uploaded to Google's official Search Stories YouTube channel.[1] The minute-long advertisement tells the story of a guy trying to find love in France by using Google to search for things like "How to find a job in Paris" and "How to impress a French girl." The video received over six million views in two years. The first parody was uploaded by YouTuber searchstory on December 2nd, 2009 and contained a search story about a surprise birthday party resulting in a heart attack.  More research is needed to determine origin. It is suspected that the meme began in the early-to-mid 90s. TinEye image search results return nearly 700 instances of this photo in various languages. The toilet training video known as this name today, was originally titled "If You Can Go To The Toilet, You're A Pantsman!" (トイレで できたら パンツマン) which was included in a companion DVD of the 2006 April issue of Kodomo Challenge Pocket, a correspondence education materials for toddlers (2-3 years old) released by Benesse.[1] In this video, their mascot character Shimajirō, who also stars in the anime series Shima Shima Tora no Shimajirō, [2] tries pooping and peeing by himself in the toilet. After the short ends, a video is shown of a child using the appendix item that came with the magazine. A sequel to the short, "Any Toilet Can Be A Piece of Cake!" (どんなトイレも　へっちゃらちゃ!) was included with the December 2006 issue of Kodomo Challenge Hop[13]. In it, Shimajirō meets two characters during a trip to the department store: Pee Bucket, who teaches him to get to the bathroom before having an accident, and Squat Toilet, who teaches him how to poop in a squat toilet. This video became almost as popular as the original Shimajiro toilet training video.   In November 2006, Smith Magazine[3], an online literary magazine founded by Larry Smith in January that year, asked its readers to submit six-word memoirs via Twitter using the hashtag #sixwords.[4] A small selection of the entries were then compiled and published into a book titled "Not Quite What I Was Planning: Six-Word Memoirs by Writers Famous and Obscure" on February 5th, 2008.[1] According to the publisher's description, the project was inspired by Ernest Hemingway's classic six word flash fiction, “For Sale: baby shoes, never worn.”[6] On April 3rd, 2008, YouTuber micahsamaniac uploaded a video titled "My Life in 6 Words," in which he sums up his life story as "a roller coaster ride of unbelievable events" and instructs the viewers to share their own six-word memoirs. On October 10th, 1993, video game "Link: The Faces of Evil" for Philips CD-i, developed by Animation Magic, was released.[1][2] In the Gonoru area of the game, the player encounters shopkeeper Morshu, from whom they can buy bombs, rope and lamp oil with rupees (cutscenes shown below). Lamp oil, rope, bombs – you want it? It's yours, my friend, as long as you have enough rupees. Sorry, Link, I can't give credit! Come back whey you're a little – mmmm – richer. Starting in mid-2008, the cutscenes of Morshu gained popularity in YouTube Poops based on "Zelda CD-i" games. On July 21st, 2008, YouTuber[3] Xaragon64DS posted one of the earliest known YouTube poops based on the Morshu's cutscenes, gaining over 71,800 views in twelve years (shown below). The original acrylic painting "Allison" was created and uploaded via Flickr by Portland-based artist Craig Wheat[1] in early 2009. The earliest captioned instance was posted via Brittnie's Tumblr blog[2] on August 24th, 2009; the caption read "well, it doesn’t matter who is better because Hipster Kitty will doubt EVERYONE’S indie cred." Since its upload onto Tumblr, this image macro has been re-blogged and liked hundreds of times on the microblogging network: The Origin of the slang term is uncertain, there are currently two common explanations, more exist, but these are most common.  The earliest instance that falls under this category is Can this donkey from Shrek get more fans than Sarkozy?[2] :http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=44958576484 (Pour que l'âne de Shrek comptabilise plus de fans que Sarkozy), created on December, 15th, 2008. In less than two weeks, the donkey's fan count surpassed that of President Sarkozy with 43,738 Facebook fans (at the time). FAN COUNT STATS: 12/15/2008 – 5 pm: Group created 12/21/2008 – 8:30 pm: 1107 members … (in effect … :-)) 12/24/2008 – 8:30 pm: 7700 members 12/27/2008 – 8:30 pm: 52,600 members … (Success … ;-) Haw haw As of April 2010, the donkey has over 574,900+ fans, suggesting anti-Sarkozy groups still remain strong and present on Facebook. Also See: Sarkozy Was There.   The margarine brand was originally developed by the J.H. Filbert company in 1979, and was introduced to retail industries in 1981 in Washington, DC. The company was purchased by Unilever in 1986, which resulted in the brand being shipped and marketed in other countries. The marketing campaigns for the brand in the 1980s and 1990s were very notable, and are often a topic of nostalgia – they often featured people in melodramatic situations saying "I can't believe it's not butter!" Several memorable commercials featured the male model Fabio. As of 2005, I Can't Believe It's Not Butter is the best-selling butter-substitute in America. For more information, please click this link to snopes.com's page. One of the first websites that this video was posted to was Google Video, on April 3rd of 2006. This is the original video (the first time this video was posted to the web). The link for that video is here. The reason for the title of this meme being "Lady Punch" rather than "old lady punch" or "lady getting punched" is due to the fact that the original video was entitled Lady Punch. Snookieshop tumblr blog was created by Sean Ahern and the first instance of the shoop series was uploaded on February 9th, 2010. (currently researching) The original video was uploaded on March 17, 2008, by YouTube user "wagzqix".[1] It uses the audio from a 1991 Belgian TV advertisment for Royco Cup-a-Soup. The audio contains an 80's style song about the product. The original Flemish lyrics are as follows: The English translation reading as: There are several possible origins for the adaption, all placing the emergence around 2003-2004: One is the shortening of the term pwned to "pwn'd", and varients of that. Exactly when the "pwn'd" variant entered popular culture is difficult to assess; a date search in Google shows "pwn'd" coming into common usage by around 2004. The MTV show Punk'd first aired in 2003 and lasted 5 seasons. The show involved tricking celebrities and others through hidden camera jokes. As a popular show with younger crowds, also at the time of continued growth of the Internet, the mutation of the phrase could easily come from here. Another traceable origin of "'d" slang is from Homestar Runner. Part of the cartoons of Homestar Runner include segments called "Teen Girl Squad", a cartoon "drawn" by the character of Strongbad. The cartoon features four teenaged girls that suffer from horrible fates imagined by Strongbad. In the first Teen Girl Squad (made available in 2002), one of the characters is killed by a man that shoots arrows out of his mouth, with a phrase of onomatopoeia citing "Arrowed!!!" (yes, the first use lacked the "'d" statement) The man, later called the Arrow'd Guy, would reappear in future Teen Girl Squad comics, killing one or more of the characters with a similar onomatopoeia but now using the "'d" addition, including: work DEFINITELY in progress Peter, whose real name is Sesame[3], first appeared online in early 2006[4] in a photo that would be used as the base image for Lenin Cat. His owner, YouTuber gomaneshi[5], has referred to him as Peter in a few videos. Peter first appeared on 4chan on April 9th, 2009, when someone posted Peter's photo to 4chan's /b/ (random) board with an unrelated post seeking romantic advice. The thread was not archived. TRY TO GET THE MOST KILLS AND ALWAYS REMEMBER RANGERS LEAD THE WAY! OORAH! "OMEGLE WARFARE 2". The meme was very popular back then, and still many people play, trying to get the most "kills". Lynndie England is a former Army private in the 372nd Military Police Company who was one of the 11 military personnel involved in torturing and abusing prisoners of war in the Abu Ghraib prison during the Iraq War. On April 28th, 2004, the CBS News program 60 Minutes reported on the abuse showing photos of the incident including a picture of Lynndie England pointing to an unnamed prisoner who had been stripped naked and forced to masturbate with a bag placed over his head. In August of 2004, the British blog Bad Gas[2] created a page for "doing a Lynndie" that included the following instructions: The term “gar” is rumored to have been coined on 4chan after an anonymous user accidentally posted "I am gar for Archer" to express his admiration for the character from the Japanese anime series Fate/Stay Night, which was meant to be read as “I am gay for Archer.” The earliest known definition of "gar" was submitted by Urban Dictionary[5] user Ryukage on May 2nd, 2006, describing the term as same-sex appreciation for a male character’s masculine traits.   On May 1st, 2003, less than two months into the U.S. military operations in Iraq, President George W. Bush arrived on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln to praise the success of the mission, which was delivered in front of a large banner adorned in an American flag motif with the words "Mission Accomplished" written across it. His speech, along with the banner, suggested that the war efforts in Iraq were complete. In the following weeks, however, hostilities in the area continued to escalate, with number of US military casualties eventually exceeding the figures prior to the speech in May 2003. Soon, cable TV pundits like John Stewart and Stephen Colbert began ridiculing the meaning of the "Mission Accomplished" sign and speech, using it as a fodder to criticize the Bush administration's foreign policies. In August 1997, Gene Ray, an American electrician living in Florida, posted an early draft of Nature's Harmonic Simultaneous 4-day Time Cube on his personal website timecube.com.[1] Using colorful, oversized HTML text, occasional diagrams and ill-equipped metaphors, Ray argued that time-space continuum of the universe is shaped like a cube, while blaming the academic circles for denying the ineffable truth of "four days per rotation": In the grand scheme of what he called "Time-Cubism," 4 is considered the supreme number of the universe and thus, the time-space continuum can be divided into four classes, much like the Greeks did with the four humours and the four elements. These classes are called corners, which can be applied across several category fields:  On the Ben Olding Games Forum, a .gif of a blue wink was used extensively when saying something condescending, rather than its intended purpose. Its use began to reach plague proportions, when the user named SU-27SK Flanker placed the following message in his signature, "STOP THE USE OF THE PATTRONIZING BLUE WINK!!!" On the 10th of May 2009, a larger version of this .gif was created. The Patronizing Blue Wink This image was later used to be used in many of the captioned pictures. The scene originates from the SpongeBob Squarepants – Season 2 – Episode 26b Squidville, which aired March 6, 2001. In the scene, SpongeBob, and Patrick Star end up destroying Squidward's house. When the remains of Squidwards house fall down, amongst them is a television. The TV runs a commercial, which interests Squidward, but Patrick closes the TV, and declares "I hate this channel.". The first video parody, and a demonstration of the scene's exploitable nature, was made by a YouTube user named shark890, and was uploaded on YouTube July 24, 2009. The original parody recieved over 40 responses.     The Tumblr blog was created by Los Angeles-based copywriter Greg Szmurlo[2] on January 13th, 2010. The first batch of eight artworks were posted without explanation, aside from the description of the type of sandwich displayed in each image. Szmurlo later told ABC News[15] that the blog was inspired by a dream he had where Tom Selleck was eating a sandwich in a meadow. His mustache spoke to Szmurlo in Portugese, asking him to make this dream a reality.     This meme appeared in Facebook in the mid late 2009. Any person is worthy of having fans there, but the latest fashion has its own name: “Ladies that …”. Middle aged women have become the stars of the social network, with over 600 groups dedicated to their small or great virtues and defects that have thousands of fans. Some are even offensive, but the humor is mordant and sardonic in general. The concept design was originally conceived by the artificial intelligence cognitive scientist Marvin Minsky[1] (shown below) in 1952 and a prototype dubbed "The Ultimate Machine" was built soon after by his coworker at IBM, mathematician and engineer Claude Shannon.[2] In August 1958, the machine was mentioned in Harper’s magazine[3] by renowned science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke, who described the box as sinister for its design that does nothing but turns itself off. The phrase started with the flash video The Decline of Gaming 2 on Newgrounds by the Super Flash Bros.[1] There was a parody about the Nintendo DS claiming it had 2 screens, a backlight, a mirror, a camera, a tanning booth, and that "IT EVEN PRINTS MONEY". This was to mock the fact that the DS had two screens. On January 9th, 2010, YouTuber[8] RubberFruit uploaded a video titled "Painis Cupcake eats someone" (shown below). In the video, the Soldier[1] from Team Fortress 2 lies in a mangled heap on the floor. He snaps together and then crawls across the ground towards the Spy[4] character, and with an unnerving smile, says, "I am painis cupcake," then cannibalizes the Spy. The video gained over 1.6 million views in 11 years. Soon after, YouTubers began uploading their own videos featuring the Painis Cupcake character in various situations, further fleshing out his personality, often depicting him as psychotic and cannibalistic (examples from late 2010 shown below, left and right). The line "my name is painis cupcake" is made up of multiple soundbites used in Team Fortress 2, available to listen to on TF2 Wiki.[2][3] The word "painis" is a segment of a voice command used by the Soldier, saying, "Pain is weakness leaving the body." This is combined with a line of dialogue of the Soldier saying, "Am I too violent for you, cupcake?"      The phrase “gingers have no soul” comes from the South Park episode “Ginger Kids” that first aired on November 9th, 2005. At the beginning of this episode, Eric Cartman gives a class presentation on the subject of red-headed children and “Gingervitis,” a made-up disease. On January 14th, 2010, an 18-year-old CopperCab uploaded a video titled "GINGERS DO HAVE SOULS!!" to her YouTube channel passionately expressing her frustrations with red-headed discrimination. Coppercab's video received over 3.1 million views and over 600 response videos in the first month of being uploaded. The same clip has been featured as a spotlight video in 23 regional categories and has over 210,000 comments.  The Kersal Massive is a "band" formed of 3 kids who live in Kersal, a district inside the City of Salford in North West England. This video clip is of the so-called band performing a gangsta rap, which was originally sent in to the recording company 679 Recordings in order to win a Kano BMX bike. The video of them rapping was somehow found by Youtube user Paoloray and posted to Youtube in March of 2006, where it currently has more than 500,000 views.  Musically Oblivious 8th Grader was created by Grace Spelman[1], who posted it to her since-deleted Tumblr in 2009. Spelman used a photo of her friend and fellow Tumblr user[15] Emilie Ferreira[9] from her eighth grade graduation. Spelman initially shared the photos on Tumblr to exchange jokes about music theory with her group of friends. After the template was uploaded to Memegenerator[2], more captions about popular bands or performers started appearing. The first instance uploaded on the site commented on the Icelandic singer Björk[10], confusing her with the Swedish Chef[11] from The Muppet Show. "Citation Needed" was originally introduced as part of Wikipedia's fact-checking policy in February 2006. Since its initial adoption, it has proliferated throughout the encyclopedia, appearing on approximately 421,000 pages as of April 2020.[1] It has been applied to material in Wikipedia articles and lists of all sorts, and in particular to information about living persons. Here's an example of "citation needed" tag as shown in Wikipedia's article on internet memes: Wikipedia even has an article about the tag itself. In July 2007, the popular webcomic xkcd published a comic called Wikipedian Protestor, which showed a political protester holding a "citation needed" sign at a public speech, probably in reference to President Bush's 2007 Fourth of July speech. This illustration is the earliest known instance of using the Wiki meta-tag outside of its original context: Then in early 2008, Matt Mechtley announced the launch of a culture jamming operation on his blog, which entails putting "citation needed" stickers on corporate advertisements in New York City: One day an idea struck -- what statements are more dubious or outright ridiculous than those in advertisements? Thus, an OM (Operation Mindf*ck) project was born. I had 250 8×2 inch stickers printed, which I handed out to friends, who circulated them further. In true Wiki fashion, the final placement of the stickers is a collaborative effort, now distributed and anonymous. If anyone sees one somewhere, please make a photo! I’ve been tagging my photoset on Flickr with citationneeded and wikiffiti. The first instance of this fad was "Select your Paperweight" by a YouTube user KYerp123.[4] This video posted on October 14th, 2009 was also the original starter of a YouTube Poop fad called Sonic Says.  The earliest reference to the fansub can be found on a page created for the wiki Tanasinn.info on October 7th, 2007 by user I am a proud member of the Elitist Superstructure of DQN.[1] The screencap features Light Yagami and the subtitle "Just according to keikaku", with a note on the upper part of the image featuring "(Translator's note: Keikaku means plan)". The slightly altered version of the phrase appears in verse 7:10 of the Book of Micah of the Old Testament (seen below).[1] Then my enemy will see, and shame will cover her who said to me, “Where is the LORD your God?” My eyes will look upon her; now she will be trampled down like the mire of the streets. The phrase "Where Is the Lord your God?" is generally interpreted as "the enemy" (the Chaldean) luring the city of Jerusalem into questioning its faith in Jehovah when Jehovah did not aid the city as it was attacked by the Chaldeans.[2][3] Versions of the phrase also appear in the Bible, in Torah and in a number of Psalms, typically said by Israel's enemies to the people of Israel about their God (shown below).[4] My tears have been my food day and night, while they continually say to me, “Where is your God?” (Psalm 42:1-3) He will say: Where are their gods, their rock in whom they trusted, which ate the fat of their sacrifices and drank the wine of their drink offerings? (Deuteronomy 32:36-38) In October 2004, a Burger King commercial called "Wake Up for With Burger King" premiered in the U.S. (shown below). In the commercial, a man wakes up to find The Burger King lying next to him and staring at him. On March 28th, 2005, YTMBD[5] user ilpadrino created a YTMND titled "WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW?" that featured a still image of The Burger King staring at the man, captioned with the phrase. The page received nearly 80,000 views in 16 years (still image shown below).              The scene is taken from the 53rd chapter of the manga series, which was released on July 4th, 2005.[1] The main character of the series, Light Yagami (nickname: Kira), gains his forgotten memories back after coming in contact with the Death Note. Shortly after regaining his memories, he claims himself victorious and says to himself, "Just as planned". The scene returns in Episode 24 of the anime series which aired on March 27th, 2007, in Japan and April 6th, 2008, in the US.[2] In the English version, the sentence has been changed to "exactly as planned".   Tunak Tunak Tun (ਤੁਨਕ ਤੁਨਕ ਤੁਨ) is a Bhangra Pop[2] song released in 1998 by Punjabi musician Daler Mehndi. At the time, Indian music critics were skeptical of Mehndi's popularity, speculating that his main appeal was the women dancing in his music videos, like in "Ho Jayegi Balle Balle"[3]. In response to criticisms of his previous music videos, Mehndi sought a drastically different style with "Tunak Tunak Tun" by featuring four clones of himself (representing the four natural elements) dancing and singing over various CGI backgrounds. Despite the lack of "hawt babes" dancing in the music video, the song was a success in the world of Bhangra Pop. The first parody "Tunak Tunak Tun" music video was created by internet comedian Dan Gomiller[4] and uploaded in 2001. According to the IMDB entry[5], Gomiller's parody video recieved 17,000 hits a day at its peak:  This phrase was used in the 1991 movie, Suburban Commando starring Hulk Hogan as an intergalactic warrior named Shep Ramsey. During a scene, Shep gets into an argument with Charlie Wilcox played by Christopher Lloyd and Charlie says "I was frozen today!" as a reference to when he was frozen in an earlier scene and the argument is ended.    The practice of fan-made OP/ED parody videos started when video tapes became mainstream in 1980’s. The earliest instances of the parody videos were created by college anime circles or indie movie groups, and had been shared through small indie film events, doujin convention, or hand delivery among otaku people. Famous instances in this pre-internet era are "Aura Farmer Combine" (農耕士コンバイン, Noukoushi Combine) and the opening movie of "C3B" (CardCaptor Cherry Blossom). The former is an all hand-drawn animated parody film for a TV anime Aura Battler Dunbine[1], which was created by Akita University Animation Club members in 1985. The latter is a live-action parody for a TV anime Cardcaptor Sakura.[2] This weird parody video was released at a doujin convention by Nagoya-residing doujin groups on February 2000. OP/ED parody had been also one of the standard styles in MAD videos since its birth in the same mid-1980s. Among them, "Otaku no MAD Video" series by Hajioh (はじおう) and The Fake OP Video Committee (インチキOP制作委員会) in 1997-1998 is known as the pioneer of online MAD videos, and it contained many OP parody style videos as its name suggests. In addition, the Japanese 2channel-led flash movie creation movement in the first half of 2000s was also triggered by well-made anime parodies. A Japanese flash animation creator Wosa's anime OP parody series featuring 2channel Shift-JIS art characters is known as the originator of anime parodies in the movement. However, these videos were usually taken down by the creators within a short period or distributed among fans in the underground web culture via anonymous uploaders or P2P softwares because of the copyright issues. The popularization of YouTube in 2006 and the launch of the Japanese video sharing service Nico Nico Douga in the following year drastically changed consciousness of the copyrights among both people and Japanese media companies. The breakthrough was brought by fan works for the OP/ED movies "Hare Hare Yukai" and "Motteke! Sailor Fuku" from Kyoto Animation's hit titles The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya and Lucky Star. A huge amount of tributes for the movies openly took the online video hub sites by storm in late-2000s, and many copyright holders became not to frequently remove online fan creations utilizing their contents except for several rigid media companies. At this point, OP/ED Parodies finally succeeded to achieve the status of the popular genre in fan creations on the overground web. The first mention of the "Fukken saved" slang is from this mspaint comic: There is no real date information with that picture. The earliest archived thread featuring someone reusing that slang is from the 12th of december 2006: [ Caution. 4chanarchive link: NSFW content ahead ] Because of the strong similarity between this comic and the one from the 4chan party van entry, one can assume it has been posted around the same time. On 4chan, there has been a trend in creating regular threads on Child Pornography. As gross as it must be, these threads are mainly to gather attention and sometimes to track down pedophiles though. One of those threads was responsible for that meme's birth, according to the ED's article That information can be found on Lurkmore Wiki as well:  The original video of a rooster crowing for over 30 seconds was uploaded to YouTube on February 25th, 2009 by a user in Germany, orhanx5577. Almost a year later on January 6th, 2010, musician Ewan Parry of the band Talanas found the video and created a unique Death Metal track to be placed in the background. Within two weeks of posting, it had garnered over 1 million hits. It's popularity spread due to appearing everywhere from Digg to Yahoo! Music, Los Angeles radio station KROQ and Paste Magazine in addition to hundreds of thousands of views coming from Facebook. On January 12th, 2010, it appeared in the Around the Net section of G4's "Attack of the Show" podcast Discovery News posted the video "Animals: Death Metal Rooster Explained" on January 19, 2010, in which an associate professor of Animal and Avian Sciences from the University of Maryland explains how the animal could produce the sound that long. On November 1st, 2009, the Nic Cage as Everyone single topic blog was created, with the first post featuring a picture from the film Jurassic Park edited with Cage's face over actor Jeff Goldblum (shown below).[1] In an e-mail exchange with the pop culture site Asylum, the blogger behind the project explained how the idea came to be. the first video, Extreme Tooth brushing, was uploaded on August 12, 2008 by Youtube user ArtieTSMITW. It starts with a door just showing while Three Inches of Blood – "Deadly Sinners" plays. The title pops up and the title shows. The door bust open and the actor begins screaming. He looks at a toothbrush and picks it up. Then he grabs scotch tape and tapes the brush to the wall. Still screaming, he grabs toothpaste and smashes it, causing the paste to hit the brush. He starts brushing his teeth rapidly, then moves on to around his face, on his forehead, and eventually brushing his hair with it. He fills a Dixie cup with water and splashes it into his mouth and spits out it out. It then ends with him yelling still and walking out the room.  On July 31st, 2005, YTMND[1] user FelixFX created a page titled "I think something just raped my ears," featuring an audio clip of the Canadian singer Avril Lavigne singing System of a Down's "Chop Suey" over a photoshopped image of someone holding a gun to her mouth (seen below). The page gained over 20,000 views in 16 years. Throughout 2006, several other ear rape pages were created on YTMND. For example, on May 11th, 2006, YTMND[4] user PsychoCola created a page titled "THIS SITE WILL RAPE YOUR EARS," consisting of a constant distorted tone. On July 30th, YTMND[5] user NESer created a page titled "(NSFW) ear rape," consisting of a similar tone garnering over 11,500 views in 15 years. As of February 2021, typing "ear rape" into YTMND[3] results in over 100 results.  On August 11, 2007, YouTube user PanicBomber decided to make a new form of RickRoll; a scary version of RickRoll. The audio is run through a harmonizing filter, while the video's colors are inverted. Chewiki further corroborates the idea that the G Major Poopism was inspired by the ScaryRoll video. These "scary" Youtube Poops are essentially the same thing as X in G Major, except that they may be harmonized through any chord. "Ding Fries Are Done" is a single track off a 1993 Christmas album titled A Very Spastic Christmas.  In 2002, a chat log was uploaded to the database Bash.org,[4] featuring a conversation between users Bloodninja and BritneySpears14. In the dialogue, Bloodninja assumes the role of a wizard when the two begin to engage in cybersex, initiating the roleplay with "I put on my robe and wizard hat" (shown below). Although unconfirmed, the Internet humor site Fugly[5] claims to have created the Bloodninja chat logs.   The use of that slang is as old as IRC and chatrooms. The earliest Urban Dictionary definition of "Ragequit" became available on March 28th, 2005. However, nobody can be certain exactly when "Ragequit" was first coined. The entry describes "ragequitting" in the context of online gaming: In another definition submitted on August 15th, 2005, "ragequitting" is explained in the context of general online chat:   While one is unable to pinpoint the exact date of the start of this meme, it has been popularly featured on 4chan's random board (/b/) since 2007. The earliest 4chan archive thread[1] dates back to December of 2007. The origin of the picture comes from a widely-used image of an old man apparently having a heart attack. It is the first image that appears when one searches for "heart attack" in Google Images[2]. Since it is essentially a stock photo, the image is also used in other contexts.  In early 2006, a peculiar image of a cute kitten with a sad look began to circulate on Internet. Then, someone else came up with a silly idea to pair it up with an equally innocent caption that read "is it can be hugs tiem now plees?" According to the Encyclopedia Dramatica, the original instance (as shown above) came from a British forum site B3ta and one of the early derivatives was first uploaded on ErrorAccessDenied.com on November 14th, 2006.  While the challenge became a viral phenomenon on YouTube, its origin precedes the history of the video-sharing community. The earliest known attempt at the game can be traced back to The Cinnamon Challenge 2001, which was hosted by Michael Buffington and played by Erik Goodlad. The result was documented and posted as a blog article on Buffington's blog. The story was picked up by Jason Kottke on December 22nd, 2001.[1] The earliest YouTube version was uploaded on April 2nd, 2006 in a video titled "Pipe Attempts the Cinnamon Challenge." Throughout the rest of 2006, several videos depicting similar attempts were posted on the site. American Idol's audition took place in June 2009 in Atlanta, Georgia; Larry Platt's performance aired on January 13, 2010. While the first YouTube upload of Larry's segment was taken down due to copyright claims, there are several duplicates in place, like this one with 6 million plus views (as of April 2010):  The origin of "Spy sappin mah sentry" comes from the video game 'Team Fortress 2'. In this team-based FPS game created by Valve, there are 9 different 'classes' to choose before and during a match. One of them is called the 'Spy'. The Spy is armed with different kind of weapons, suiting his character. The weapon which is relevent to this meme is called the 'Electro Sapper' or 'Sapper'. However this 'weapon' doesn't affect any character from the opposing team, it is used to disable, draining energy and eventually destroying any building which is constructed by the 'Engineer'-class from the opposing team. These buildings are 'Sentry guns'/'Sentries' (automated turrets), 'Dispensers' and 'Teleporters' (entrances and exits) to help your teammates quicker to the frontline. If a Spy from the enemy team uses his 'sapper' to disable the Engineer's Sentry gun, then the Engineer will automatically respond with: "Spy's sappin' my/mah sentry". Where this meme started is a bit difficult to pinpoint but due to the catchiness of this phrase, a lot of image parody's were created on the popular video game captioning website Halolz and other forum websites, which made it pretty popular. The one thing we know is that it wasn't spread on Youtube. The existing videos of "Spy sappin' mah sentry" don't have that much attention. So it is possible that it was mostly spread on aforementioned forum sites. Please help me with the origin in the comment! A user on the Brawl Central Forums figured out how to hack the game, and by playing around the settings, he discovered that he could change the movesets of the characters. When a player plays as Pikachu using Ganondorf's moveset, it gives Pikachu Ganondorf's animations, thus altering its appearance.     The origin of this meme comes from a scene in the Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood serie were two persons are talking and one reacts with a "Sad Mustache" face. Reaction/Expression: Didn't expect that/ or you made him sad. ~His mouth turned into a sad looking mustache.       The first appearance of the "Hammer" melody was the popular 8-bit arcade game, Donkey Kong, where it was the theme that played when Mario (who was only known as "Jumpman" at the time) in 1986. It is based on the "Charging" trumpet tune used in military battles. This song has been also reused in the 1994 Game Boy game Donkey Kong, as well as the Super Smash Brothers series (seen below) since late 1990s. The earliest usage of "lion face" ( ) as an emoticon stems from the meme "Jesus Christ it's a lion, get in the car", which was popularized on 4chan's /b/ (random) board in 2006. On April 23rd, 2008, a 4chan user posted a photograph of an American dollar banknote with a lion face drawn over George Washington's portrait, explaining that the user wished to add lion faces to all acquired banknotes. "From now on I'm going to add lions to my bills… I wonder how long it will take for another b-tard to see one… Conversely, I wonder how long it would take America to break if every b-tard put lions on bills…"  In 2004, a deviant art user by the name of Bioviral uploaded pictures that he had made of a Pikachu and a Squirtle. In 2008, someone removed the face of the Pikachu, and posted it onto 4chan, eventually turning it into a meme. For years, the picture of the Squirtle went unnoticed. It was only a matter of time before someone else did the same thing to the Squirtle that had been done to the Pikachu. Original picture:       The earliest usage of "You Win the Internet" can be traced back to a discussion thread posted on October 26, 2004 on SomethingAwful's FYAD forum as documented in this archived text file.[1] According to the comments section in a WebSnark article[2] posted in February 2006, "You Win the Internet" actually stems from another popular comment made by a user known as "bombscare" in IRC chatroom circa 2002. Batman: The Movie[1] starring Adam West and Burt Ward was released on July 20th, 1966. Influenced by the early portrayal of the superhero on TV, the film features saturated colors, special effects and melodramatic acting performances. In this particular scene, Batman frantically dashes around the pier to get rid of a comically oversized bomb ticking in his hand. As he clears past a number of obstacles and pedestrians on a boardwalk, Batman shouts "some days, you just can't get rid of a bomb!" Among the fans of the Batman franchise, the film has reached a cult status for its comedic theme. Along with a number of other scenes from the film, the "Batman bomb" scene has been explored by the fans since the early days of online forums and BBS, with the earliest known discussion attributed to an article published by Quarter Bin[2] in late 2001. Another photoshopped instance referencing the scene can be found in Something Awful forum's Photoshop Friday[3] contest in April 2004. However, the large-scale proliferation of the scene did not occur until it became a popular fad on the image sharing community YTMND in June 2004.  The original photo of the gray bat being brushed with a toothbrush was shared on Facebook[1] in an album titled "Baby Bats" by Australian Mandi Griffith on January 28th, 2008. The photo was reshared in the public group Bats!!![3] shortly after with the caption "Rubberlegs enjoying a brush with his blue toothbrush." However, since Griffith has made the album private, the photo is no longer accessible.  The still image comes from a scene in American Psycho in which the protagonist Patrick Bateman murders his business rival Paul Allen (played by Jared Leto) after a lengthy commentary on Huey Lewis and the News (shown below). On 4chan, the phenomena of predicting post numbers gradually formed into what is known as a "GET". It is unclear when the image of Patrick Bateman became associated with posts ending in double numbers, but the earliest search queries for "dubs guy" on Google date back to early 2010 according to Google Trends.[2] The song I'll Go to Tokyo[2] was originally written and sung by Japanese singer/songwriter Yoshihito Kamata, known by his stage name Yoshi Ikuzo, and was released in Japan on November 25th, 1984. The song is set around a young cow breeder living in the countryside, who longs about moving to Tokyo and to make it big. Upon its release in 1984, the song became quite popular across Japan, to the point when some local agricultural villages took offense and protested the lyrics. The origin of the message is unclear, but one of the earliest postings of the copypasta status update was submitted to Yahoo! Answers Canada[1] on December 29th, 2009. In this instance, there was no mention of breast cancer and the message was seemingly intended to confuse male friends on Facebook.  The panels originally show up in Junji Ito's The Junji Ito Horror Comic Collection" Volume 16: Frankenstein (フランケンシュタイン). The original run of the Manga was published from 1994 to 1998, with the collected edition also being published in 1998.[1] The story is a loose adaptation of Mary Shelley's 1818 novel Frankenstein. These panels show up on page 176 of the complete collection. The original panels show Frankenstein's monster laughing at Doctor Victor Frankenstein after he discovers that his father and his fiance were killed by the monster. During or prior to 2006, the text "Dude! Let me in! I'm a Fairy!" was added to the first panel, with the text "Don't you believe in fairies?" added to the second panel. First sightings of this forced meme date back to March 2007. A thread is started with WHEN I WAS, followed by lulz. Since then, several variations of it have been spammed over and over again on /b/.  John Lurie completed his watercolor painting "Bear Surprise"[9] (shown below, left) in early 2006. The painting gained its online notoriety in February 2008, when Russian internet user Roman Yatsenko uploaded an edited version[1] (shown below, right) to Dirty.ru[2], replacing the English word "surprise" with "ПРЕВЕД" (Preved, meaning "Hello Bear"), a portmanteau term that combines a misspelling of the greeting "Privet" and "Medved," which means bear in Russian. According to Russian wikipedia[6], the misspelled usage of "Privet" began two years prior with "prevet" in 2004. While there are no screenshots available of the original post, most anecdotal accounts and Google Insights data suggest that the meme originated on 4chan with the "Rape Clock" image macro posted in late 2007: This particular instance depicts the monster character "Pyramid Head" from Silent Hill 2 pointing at the clock with the word "rape" written all over, with the caption reading: "Good Heavens, Just Look at the Time." The macro is almost always used to imply that the thread is doomed. The original picture of the cat was drawn in 2007 (left) for a cat simulation game website, Pure Felinity. The 2009 drawing (right) is just an enhanced version done on Photoshop. The cat was categorized as a Ticked European Shorthair breed.  The first video following Random's style was "Heavy Is Being Random" which was uploaded as a response video to that above on December 30th, 2009.[3] As evidenced by the title, This video featured Heavy from Team Fortress 2. On May 13, 2007, a Filipino college student by the name of Chad Warden, under the user name chadwardenn, uploaded a video blog (AKA vlog) onto YouTube stating absurd reasons as to why the Playstation 3 was a better video game console compared to the Xbox 360 and the Wii consoles (see top video and second part below this paragraph). Typically there is nothing special about a fanboy uploading his biased views of one console over another. What gathered so many views was the character that Chad portrayed; that of a self-contradictory fanboy who is severely misinformed.  The second opening movie featuring this song started after the 26th episode in the animation series aired in 2007, and it featured high peaced and psychedelic scenes from the anime to keep up with the song, witch many fans found misplaced and unfitting to the rest of the series. The Death Note anime episodes is well known for its slow paced and complex tone compared to other animes, thats why the second opening of the series called so much attention. Then, people found it should be funny to replace the video with other animes unfitting as well for some comedic value. And then a meme was born.    The first known example of "You Are Reading This in my Voice" occurred on May 29th, 2009 in an epic 4chan thread #138566834 started by moot[1] featuring Boxy Brown from Aqua Teen Hunger Force.   On August 12th 2006, YTMND user ALMusic produced a site[1] taking a short segment from movie Jurassic Park in which the main characters are dumbfounded by a dinosaur walking past them. The movie's main theme is also playing in the background, but with additional lyrics written by ALMusic to accompany the song. Shown below is a YouTube version of the original YTMND: While the original site didn't start a noticeable trend on YTMND aside from a handful of responses[2], it was generally well-received by the community's audience with an average score of 4.65 out of 5 and more than 915,000 views (as of August 2011).      On September 7th, 2001, the Spongebob Squarepants episode "Band Geeks" premiered in the United States.[1] In the episode, Squidward Tentacles starts a marching band, whom SpongeBob is a member of, to play at the Bubble Bowl so he can impress his rival Squilliam Fancyson. At the performance, he reluctantly conducts the band, believing he failed to teach them how to play well, but is proved wrong as the band performs David Glen Eisley's "Sweet Victory".[2] SpongeBob had secretly trained the band the night before the concert. One of the game's playable characters is Private James Ramirez, the deuteragonist of the campaign that is first introduced in the "Wolverines!" mission. According to the Call of Duty Wiki[1], Sergeant Foley gives a total of 56 scripted orders to Ramirez during the game.   On March 20th, 2006, the video game Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion was released in the United States.[1] In the game, the Imperial Guard interacts with the player by delivering a variety of lines of dialogue when the player makes infraction against the laws in the game (clip below).   The earliest usage of OMGWTFBBQ can be traced to Something Awful forums, where it was primarily used to mock other people's excessive use of three-letter acronyms like OMG and WTF. The phrase became further popular through its usage in chatrooms and online games. The Urban Dictionary entry for OMGWTFBBQ was submitted in January 2004; it was also featured as the word of the day in September 2007.  The original clip, entitled "Ren Snaps", was taken from the Ren and Stimpy episode "Stimpy's Fan Club" (shown above) in which Ren imagines himself being the President of the United States. He becomes furious when someone refuses to agree with him on some unknown issue, thus forcing Ren to push "the button" which makes a large portion of the world, visibly containing the country of Australia (though in some versions, the country is replaced with another item/place, i.e. the Guiyii video blowing up 4Chan), completely explode.  On Friday Febuary 23rd, 2007 at 9pm (EST) a thread appeared on /b/ with the following message Within minutes, replies started flooding into the thread as Anonymous prepared for what was expected to be the greatest Caturday in history. Several names and stories on how this cat came to be were suggested in the original thread. Tacgnol was chosen because it was the polar opposite of Longcat (Tacgnol = Longcat backwards) along with the story that these two cats have been forever locked in a battle of epic proportions. The original thread quickly reached the Bump Limit and dozens of new threads popped up with the same image. The photo originates from a Russian Livejournal post.[1] The photo appears to have been taken at a hippie festival.  On April 16th, 2007, cartoonist Randall Munroe illustrated the original idea (shown left) on his web comic blog xkcd[1]: On July 18th, 2007, Munroe published a photograph[2] sent to him of Andrew Burke, Chris Ranker, Ryan Dowlingsoka and Chance Brown, who experimented with the photo fad while visiting the Daredevil Falls at the Dollywood Park in Tennessee (shown right above). Later that same month, YouTuber heelofkevinZ posted several videos[2] taken from the same trip to Dollywood, which showed a group of friends playing chess on the Daredevil Falls, the River Raft ride and the Kiddie Car ride. In the movie, there is a scene where a man wakes up tossing and turning, and finds a monster in bed, which was certainly potential for an exploitable. The first YTMND was originally an NEDM derivative. In the original YTMND, the character wakes up to find Professor Happycat in the bed next to him, and lets out a scream in surprise. Link: (Only a dream… OR WAS IT?) The next day, another user did a similar YTMND, switching out Professor Happycat with the Burger King. Link: (The Ultimate Bedside Surprise) It currently has a rating of 4.57, one of the highest rated YTMND's. Burger King is the new Boogeyman  The original photo of Longcat, whose name is Shiroi (白い – “white” in Japanese) or Nobiko, first appeared on Futaba channel (2chan) sometime between 2004 and 2005 by a man from Japan[1]. On 2chan, she was referred to as "nobiiru"[2][3], which means "stretch." Variations of this included "nobiiru-tan," which was attributed to 2chan's /27/ board as early as February 2nd, 2006.[4] Longcat was first added to Urban Dictionary[5] on September 16th, 2006, attributing the name to 4chan's random board, /b/. One of the earliest archived 4chan threads using several comments to emphasize the length of Longcat dates back to July 24th, 2007[6] According to the Comics Should Be Good Archive,[1] the panel originated from the 1965 comic book "World’s Finest #153." The story is based around an alternate reality in which Batman believes that Superboy and Superman are responsible for the death of his father. The earliest known parody of the panel was submitted to the image-sharing website SFWChan[3] on June 10th, 2008, in which the speech bubble text is changed to have Robin ask Batman what his parents got him for Christmas (shown below), to which Batman responds with a slap while yelling "my parents are dead!!" (shown below) Robin: "Hey Batman, what are your parents getting you for Christ-" Batman: "My parents are deeaaaaaaad!!!" WDYDWYD began as a personal project by a San Francisco artist Tony Deifell in 2004. According to his blog entry on the official site, the idea was first conceived while participating in a telephone questionnaire in 1999: WDYDWYD Exhibition at the Burning Man 2009 In the summer of 2004, Tony Deifell and Mardie Oakes began documenting people's responses while attending the Burning Man, an annual art festival in Black Rock Desert, Nevada. Meant to be an open collaboration project, those who participated in Deifell's project further spread the question by asking others.   Bad Dudes Vs. DragonNinja is a 1988 beat'em up arcade game developed and published by Data East. The story follows the adventuress of two street-fighting bad dudes, Blade and Striker, who must infiltrate the secret ninja base in order to rescue President Ronnie, a character based on Ronald Reagan. Upon completing the mission, the President thanks the bad dudes and invite them for a hamburger at the White House. One of the earliest online references to the game and the catchphrase can be found in the archives of insaneabode.com[2], a personal website created sometime in 2000. The music video was uploaded via YouTube by CaptainAmericaAddict[1] in September 2008. The original video[8], along with his follow-up response video, has been since hidden from public viewing by the uploader, who is widely believed to be Ben Ryan himself. The version below is a recapture of the video dubbed with YouTuber Japanese TeaSet's commentaries. Asiacopter was started by the infamous YTMND user, inkdrinker. The first site, THE ORIGINAL ASIACOPTER, was uploaded July 8, 2005. The image was taken from the North Carolina State University's "WolfWeb" message board. The image itself features an Asian student spinning around like a helicopter using stop motion. Due to inkdrinker's downvoting, the site didn't receive much attention until user DrWorm1125 uploaded Asiacopter 2. It used the orchestral version of the Main theme song from Final Fantasy VII, which became the official song of the fad.     While its start is unclear, Wharrgarbl appears to have originated from the Ars Technica OpenForum's off topic forum, the Lounge. It appears to have been used as a "replacement meme" to keep members occupied, almost as an inside joke by the moderators to amuse other members, but it lasted longer than expected. This could classify it as a forced meme. Since the 2008 presidential campaign, wharrgarbl has been frequently used on website Fark.com in political threads where a person continues to spew rhetoric in the face of often conclusive evidence to the contrary. Examples: (Nov 2010) (Mar 2009) (Aug 2008) *Not used in the headline, but in the comments By now, it has evolved from representing the original WHARRGARBL dog, to incoherent ramblings, to anything holding its mouth open and being showered upon. The picture usually is captioned "WHARRGARBL", and may be in poster form with WHARRGARBL in the title and subtitle.         Though the quote originally appeared on the manga version of the series, it became notable on animated adaptation. On June 10th, 2006, the episode "Holy Grail" aired. In the episode, the series' main protagonist Shirou Emiya discusses his body's ability to regenerate from fatal injuries due to a relic known as "Avalon" that was implanted inside of him by Kiritsugu Emiya. It is during this scene that the line appears in the English-translation subtitles (shown below). The character first appeared in the comic for the Day 4 Update of the "Sniper Vs. Spy" update as a character printed onto a newspaper[1] on May 25 2009[2]. He would get his debut as a full character in the WAR! Update comic[3].        The phrase first appeared in a story featured on the website Five-Minute Star Trek[3], which published fan-submitted abridged versions of nearly every episode of the Star Trek series. The line was written in February 2005 by Kira in their rewrite[1] of the 1967 episode "The Return of the Archons."[2] Originally attributed to Captain Kirk, the quote was meant to represent the character’s egotistical view of himself after successfully outsmarting a computer. The first demotivational-style image macro with the line was seen on Echosphere.net[4] sometime before August 13th, 2006.  Cthulhu first appeared in the short story The Call of Cthulhu, which was published in the February, 1928 edition of Weird Tales, a fantasy/horrific magazine that ran from 1923 to 1954. The monster was inspired by the Alfred Lord Tennyson poem 'The Kraken' which is about an enormous squid that rests at the bottom of the sea. In Weird Tales,[2] Cthulhu was established as a malevolent super-natural being trapped in R'lyeh, a fictional underwater city with non-Euclidean architecture. In the mythos, the demi-god is described as, "an octopus, a dragon, and a human caricature…. A pulpy, tentacled head surmounted a grotesque scaly body with rudimentary wings." His status is described as "dead, but dreaming" which is reiterated in a message commonly found in the Cthulhu Mythos "ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn", translated as "in his house at R'lyeh sleeping Cthulhu waits dreaming." On October 29th, 2007, the earliest-known example of a Gay Test was posted onto the picture-sharing site Evilmilk.com[1] in the form of a suggestive demotivational poster by an unknown user. The image received over 261,000 views in roughly 13 years (seen below). It is considered as one of the site's "All-Time Most Viewed Funny Pictures."[2] On August 1st, 2009, DeviantART user Yuumei uploaded a fan flash video of an American-themed character from the anime Hetalia dancing to the looped version of "Positive Vibe" by a Newgrounds member NIGHTkilla. She also uploaded a copy on YouTube: The Adoring Fan is an adolescent non-player character in the 2006 role-playing game The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. The player first encounters him after becoming Grand Champion in the Arena, and thereafter the Adoring Fan becomes the only member of the player's fanclub. The video below is likely the first "Insane Edition" video. It is by the Youtube user Anonikip, obviously an Anon. It was posted on July 16, 2007. The Mudkips were already popular at the time, but this video was different: it presented a challenge to the user. Currently, the video has more than one million views. Final Fantasy XII was a video game that came out in 2006. While the game itself was well received, what most people remember was the character Vaan's idiotic "I'm Captain Basch" segment. As this happens near the games beginning, I will not worry about spoilers. The player party rescues the character of Captain Basch from a dungeon, some years after his supposed execution. Basch needs to spread the word that his death was faked and he was alive. How? Let Vaan cause a commotion. Vaan's idea of a commotion? Running around a city yelling that he is Captain Basch. The segment of the game where this comes from: Vaan's Lines: I'm Captain Basch! I'm Captain Basch fon Rosenburg of Dalmasca! Don't Listen to Ondore's Lies! Basch Lives! These lines and how ridiculously that they are presented are one of the reason that Vaan is not a popular character among Final Fantasy fans.   The B&W footage of Al Minns & Leon James' performance was originally recorded at the Savoy Ballroom in the 1950s and later featured in The Spirit Moves: A History of Black Social Dance on Film (1983).[1] The first remix version was uploaded by YouTube user charlesfondue[2] on May 11, 2006. Titled "charleston style," the video shows Minns & James' dance footage dubbed with Daft Punk's "Around The World". As of January 2013, this video has been viewed 4.3 million times.  On November 7th, the website ChatRoulette.com was launched. Much like Omegle, it pairs up 2 random people and allows them to communicate with each other only now with a webcam and sound. It took only a few days for Anonymous to find the website and see it as the perfect place for trolling and lulz. An Anon using a virtual webcam, showed 4chan memes to unsuspecting chatters to which some of them reacted rather weirdly. After screenshots were posted on /b/ a new game was born. The point is to show a funny, offensive, strange or pornographic image or video and get strange or funny reaction out of the other chatter. As the days went by, ChatRoulette's popularity kept growing to the point where there is an active thread on /b/ at all times.   On November 11th 2008, YouTube user HurricaneAubrey[1] posted a video titled "51 things i found around my house". The video shows close-up shots of Aubrey and her various possessions from a Nintendo DS collection to New York City metro cards. The music playing in the background is by artist Kevin Macleod. YouTube officially featured the video on its homepage on the same day of its upload. The original video has received a total of 2,336,772 views and 756 video responses as of August 22nd, 2011. In Episode 12 of the series, Ranka Lee swoops into a live battlefield in a mecha equipped with PA speakers and sings her debut song "Interstellar Flight" while in the mid-air. Watching her from below, everyone suddenly stops fighting because there's a live concert. Ranka does her Kira pose twice during the performance, overshadowing all the serious biz happening on the battlefield with her super-cuteness. It's a highly unrealistic situation, but who cares, it is cute. Meanwhile, this song is originally sung by Megumi Nakajima, who also does the voice of Ranka Lee character.[2] Any Bonds Today? was a 90-second cartoon that was released in movie theaters as an advertisement to encourage people to buy War Bonds. Leon Schlesinger's cartoon featured Warner Bros. character, Bugs Bunny and other Looney Tunes character singing the derivative of the song "Any Yams Today?". The racial dilemma in the advertisement was that during the song, Bugs Bunny transforms into an all-out minstrel approximately at 1:02. The 15-second sequence is actually a parody of Al Jolson in the theatrical make-up Blackface The scene comes from the SpongeBob SquarePants episode "Something Smells," which first aired on October 28th, 2000. The scene with the distinctive noise was uploaded to YouTube on November 15th, 2010, gaining 220,000 views (shown below, left). On October 6th, 2007, a video was uploaded exclusively of the sound, gaining 1.3 million views (shown below, right). "Baww" was first used in comics as a way for writers to express a character crying. One of the earliest instances of the phrase appearing in print was published in an 1947 issue of the comic Egbert[1], where a rabbit named Buzz is trying to help another rabbit, Bunnyhunch, with a toothache.[2] Bunnyhunch expresses his pain through the word "bawww" twice in the comic. The meaning of "Baww" was first added to Urban Dictionary[9] on August 5th, 2007, which defines the onomatopoeia as synonymous with the act of whining or a patronizing response to another person's ramblings, similar to the use of tl;dr.  The original Gay Fuel YTMND was created by user petercoffin. However, it did not gain popularity until user inkdrinker uploaded Gay Fuel on June 6, 2004. This version used Tarzan Boy by Baltimora instead of the original audio (Which was surprisingly fitting.) and a higher quality image. Many sites were made depicting characters promoting or using Gay Fuel (or a similar product), such as Gay Fuel testimonial commercial. On October 23rd, 2009, New York-centric blog Gothamist featured a photo sent in by a reader with the details: The simplicity of the image and the relatability of the rat led Gothamist readers to immediately begin photoshopping the image to add other people trapped in the sidewalk, or rat accessories. Gothamist began collecting a gallery of the user generated knockoffs. The same day, the Gothamist story was reblogged on Buzzfeed. On October 24th, Gothamist published a gallery of all of the user-submitted edits to the photo. October 27th, it was submitted to Buzzfeed again. October 29th, Urlesque also featured Sad Rat.  The inspiration for the hoax originally came from a joke performed by comedian Gilbert Gottfried at the Comedy Central roast of a fellow actor/comedian Bob Saget in August of 2008. After citing a nonexistent rumor that the Full House sitcom star may be an unconvicted rapist and a murderer, Gottfried repeatedly warned the audience not to spread the rumor: On August 31st, 2009, the Gottfried joke was used to satirize Beck's politically insensitive mannerisms in the comments in a post on the Internet news website Fark[1] by user oddweevil: The comment spawned multiple pages of false speculations that Glenn Beck may or may not have raped and murdered a girl sometime in 1990. Upon reading the thread, Issac Eliand-Hall, a college student from Florida, created the single serving site GlennBeckRapedAndMurderedAYoungGirlIn1990.com,[2] which launched on September 1st, 2009 and received over 120,000 page views within its first 24 hours.   The above video was put on Youtube on September 15, 2009 by a Youtuber of the username "alonzochadwick". The video is of alonzo's sister sitting on the toilet and repeating the phrase "sitting on the toilet". The video currently has more than 8 million views, and its view count is still growing. His explanation as to why he posted the video on Youtube is as follows: This is not me it is my Friend & Sis (Nonnie). Nonnie posted a picture of me on Myspace 2 years ago. I told her I would get her back. She uses my flip camera all the time and used it to film all of her video's\that are on her page (Which her user name & page is "eedabc123"). She used my camera to make this video apparently, and she forgot to delete it from the camera. Thus led to the posting of this video (THE ULTIMATE REVENGE) Ahahahaha. He goes on to explain that he never thought the video would go viral. Of course, as evidenced by the many links regarding the video and the derivatives, it has. Peter Chimaera posted his first short story titled "Digimon Savez The Wrold!1111 [sic]" to the fanfiction archive website Fanfiction.net[2] on March 19th, 2002. While the work was filled with spelling and grammatical errors, it received many positive reviews encouraging Chimaera to continue submitting stories to the site. On June 25th, Chimaera published the story DOOM: Repercussions of Evil, which was subsequently removed by Fanfiction.net moderators for disregarding spelling and grammar. Set in the universe of the first-person shooter video game series Doom, the story describes the experiences of the space marine John Stalvern as he defends his base against a demon attack. John Stalvern waited. The lights above him blinked and sparked out of the air. There were demons in the base. He didn't see them, but had expected them now for years. His warnings to Cernel Joson were not listenend to and now it was too late. Far too late for now, anyway. John was a space marine for fourteen years. When he was young he watched the spaceships and he said to dad "I want to be on the ships daddy." Dad said "No! You will BE KILL BY DEMONS" There was a time when he believed him. Then as he got oldered he stopped. But now in the space station base of the UAC he knew there were demons. "This is Joson" the radio crackered. "You must fight the demons!" So John gotted his palsma rifle and blew up the wall. "HE GOING TO KILL US" said the demons "I will shoot at him" said the cyberdemon and he fired the rocket missiles. John plasmaed at him and tried to blew him up. But then the ceiling fell and they were trapped and not able to kill. "No! I must kill the demons" he shouted The radio said "No, John. You are the demons" And then John was a zombie. The dance itself comes from the opening of a Japanese TV anime Galaxy Angel Rune, the counterpart of Galaxy Angel II games (shown below, left).[1] It ran for 13 episodes in 2006 and generally did not receive very good reviews compared to it's first season. Meanwhile The song that is used is a sped-up version of Danish duo Me & My's 1995 single, "Baby Boy", by DJ Speedycake who is famous for creating the sped-up remix of Caramelldansen (shown below, right). The source clip comes from the MTV/Teletoon animated series Clone High where character Ghandi attempts to provide some impromptu acting lessons. November 28, 2009 this clip was edited and uploaded (link may crash some browsers) by YouTube user MexicanSunflower with YouTube Poop editing style, using Ghandi's high pitched "Whaaaaaaaat" and pitch correcting it to make notes for songs. A number of video responses was greatly added within a short span of time. At some point after the video was uploaded, the audio in the video was changed using YouTube's AudioSwap tool to Snoop Dogg's Ballers Night Out and annotation editing was made public, possibly in an attempt to troll people who are late to catching on to the new fad. Dr. Octogonapus ( VERY often miss-spelt 'Dr. Octagonapus') is a character that first appeared on Dominic Fera's "THE LAZER COLLECTION" video on YouTube. This character is a spoof of Marvel's Doctor Octopus, a character from the Spiderman films/comic books. In THE LAZER COLLECTION Dr. Octogonapus fires his laser at a spoof Spiderman character, along with a reference to How Do I Shot Web. Spiderman: It's time to go save the city! Hurargh! Tries to shoot web Spiderman: What the hell? Huraagh! fails again Spiderman: What the hell is going on? How do I shot web… OH MY GOD IT'S ALFRED MOLINA!

OCTOGONAPUS!!! /¯¯/_o___o___o___o____o__ _____________________________\__\¯¯o¯¯¯o¯¯¯¯¯¯o¯¯¯¯¯¯0    The earliest known reference to an Invisible Pink Unicorn came from a 1990 Usenet group talk, in a channel called alt.atheism. In it, someone created a topic about Proof of God's existence (talk archived) to challenge atheist ideas. While coming to the Christ's ressurection subject, here's the response he got: (Bold added for emphasis) Cuppycake Gumdrops is a viral video starring actress Amy Castle at age 3, singing a song by Judianna Castle, her mother. The official website of the song is cuppycake.com. It as originally uploaded to the internet in 1996, and according to the video notes, there are over 5,700 videos using The Cuppycake Song on YouTube. The above video has over 8,000 comments on it, and more than 9 million views. The video was clearly a viral hit, and it spawned many derivatives. The initial “Hey Marine” video on which these re-enactments are based was called “Dans ta Gueule” (In Your Face). Unfortunately, the video has been deleted. Due to the fact that the original photo was deleted, it is hard to gauge the performance of the video. However, the re-uploaded copy of the original has over three million views. The actress in the video is a French girl named “Marine" and is known on Youtube under her username CartmanArkana, which she also uses on her Skyrock Blog. On CartmanArkana's NetMiss.fr profile, she confirms that she is the star of the "In Your Face" video. Google Translate: Original French: French KYM researcher Tomberry got in contact with Marine and was able to provide further information on the original video. Original French: Bonsoir Alors tout d'abord navrée que tu n'ai pas reçu mon précédent message, où j'avais répondu à pas mal de tes questions donc je vais résumer: Ce n'est pas mon copain Xavier qui est sur la vidéo. C'est mon frère. J'étais vraiment étonnée de découvrir tant de parodies et autres sur cette vidéo qui était pour moi si basique. Non les gens n'ont pas changé leur comportement vis à vis de moi, mon entourage ont prit cette vidéo à la rigolade! Il y a eu plus de 3 500 000 vues avant qu'elle ne soit suprimé. Ma vidéo a été tourné en mars 2006 j'avais 16ans. Et je ne sais pas la raison exacte pour laquelle elle a été supprimé, mais je pense avoir une légère idée; peut être du fait qu'elle était violente. Violente dans le sens, où la fille (moi en l'occurence) n'a rien demandé et qu'elle se prends une baffe magistrale, gratuitement, sans doute quelques féministes ont mit leur grain de sel… C'est la seule raison qui me vient, étant donné certains commentaires qu'il m'arrivait de lire. English Translation: Hello Well first of all I'm sorry you didn't receive my previous message, where I answered many of your questions so I'll sum them up: This is not my boyfriend Xavier on the video. It's my brother. I was very surprised to find out about all the parodies and other things on that video which was for me so simple. No, people around me haven't changed their behavior toward me. My family circle didn't take that video seriously! There were more than 3 500 000 views before it got deleted. My video has been shot in March 2006 when I was 16 years old. And I don't know the exact reason why it got deleted, but I have a guess; It may be so because it was violent. Violent in a way that the girl (me in that case) didn't ask for anything and got hilariously smacked, gratuitously. No doubt some feminists came in to put their two cents on it… It's the only one reason I can think of because of some of the comments I used to read about it. Voila, I hope you'll send me the link when the article will be fully completed!    "Nuke the entire site from orbit--it's the only way to be sure" is a quote taken from the 1986 sci-fi film Aliens in which Ripley (played by Sigourney Weaver) decides that nothing is worth saving and that the only sure way to destroy all of the aliens is to nuke their habitat from the orbit. Vasquez: All right, we got seven canisters of CN-20. I say we roll them in there and nerve gas the whole fucking nest. Hicks: That's worth a try, but we don't know if it's gonna affect them. Hudson: Let's just bug out and call it even, man! What are we even talking about this for? Ripley: …I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit. It's the only way to be sure. In 2006, two UK friends Gary Clarkson and Christian Langdon created a Facebook group, which attracted over 1500 facebook users within the first two weeks.[1] Dubbed as "the most bizarre internet meme" by blogs and local news media, the game eventually went international with contributions from across the world. Today, Lying Down Game's Facebook page boasts over 99,000 followers and 19,000+ image submissions. While similar to Playing Dead, it seems the two games grew independently of each other. The Lying Down Game challenges players to lie down in the most outlandish places possible and the players are meant to appear alive when the photo is taken. The fighting game series Mortal Kombat series was created by Midway games and was first released in arcades on October 8th, 1992. Before finishing a match in the game, a fighter can perform many special moves known as "Fatalities" when the message "FINISH HIM/HER!" is spoken by the announcer and appears on the screen, indicating the time for the final strike against their defeated opponent. As the series went on, a variety of special ending messages has been introduced to the series; notably "Brutality," "Animality," "Babylity," and "Friendship." On September 2nd, 1992, the Dragon Ball Z episode "Hour of Temptation" aired in Japan. In the episode, the character Cell fights Vageta and lets out a wide-mouthed scream (shown below, left). While the origin of "Shoop da Whoop" is unknown, the website Encyclopedia Dramatica claims it originated from a flash animation called Syntax Error #2 posted in 4chan's /b/ board, which featured an image of the Dragonball Z character 'Cell' in blackface with the caption: "I'M A' FIRIN' MAH LAZER!!" (shown below, right). Sometimes, the phrase "I'M A' CHARGIN' MAH LAZER" is also used before the attack is unleashed.[1] The earliest available version of the meme was posted by DeviantArt [2] art user CrabPope on October 19th, 2006 (shown below). Within 15 years, this image of Dragon Ball sprites edited for the meme received more than 9,000 views.  Trogdor first appeared in episode 58 of the "Strong Bad e-mail" show on the Homestar Runner website.[1] Originally airing on January 13th, 2003, the episode[2] showed Strong Bad demonstrating how to draw a dragon. After an initial failed attempt, Strong Bad managed to create a dragon he was very pleased with, which became Trogdor (shown below). At the end of the episode (starting at 2:32 in the video below), a heavy metal-style music video about Trogdor plays. The episode was later posted on YouTube on March 31st, 2009, and has since received over 3.2 million views and 39,000 likes in 12 years. Following the premiere of the episode[3], Trogdor became an inside joke among fans.   The technique made its debut at chapter 148 of the manga and at episode 85 in the original anime. In the scene, Guy ambushes Jiraiya which he confuses as one of the Akatsuki.  Back in 2002, it happened in a unknown IRC channel. Very little can be said about the context surrounding that catchphrase, but it originated from a chat fragment that has been caught on a screenshot (available on the Encyclopedia Dramatica's page): A user named "ab" wrote about being away from his computer for some time and showing his lack of surprise if someone would write something funny under his username (meaning that he has already been the target of such thing before). Then, the first answer was HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS from someone else using his keyboard. The first sighting of that conversation is from this Norwegian website, the 19th of July 2002: http://x6.no/art/1496.html It gained the 14th rank on a top 50 of the best IRC quotes. According to the first comment, this article is completely copied from another webpage called http://www.geekissues.org/quotes/?top50 from the Geekissues.org website. However, that page doesn't work anymore. It then got enough popular to be featured on the bash.org website, in January 4th 2003, among other funny IRC quotes and archived there. The earliest known instance of Moneyface image was posted by b3ta forum[1] user Spunky McPunk in an "Image Challenge" thread titled "Photoshop Money" on May 22nd, 2008. In the universe of Harry Potter, "X points from Gryffindor" is a phrase frequently said by the potion master, Severus Snape, usually addressing Harry, his least favorite student. Hogwarts, the school of magic, is divided into four houses, which compete for points to win the yearly house cup. Points added bring great joy :D, and points deducted great sorrow :'(. The houses are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw and Slytherin, all named after the school's founders. During the course of the books/films, the amount of points Snape deducts from Gryffindor's score varies, but 10 is the most common number. P1ZZ4 GUY feat. Donnell Rawlings, Spider-Man and Domino's Pizza Guy The first parody of P1ZZ4 Guy was uploaded by a YTMND user BTape in January 2007. Several of them were popular, making top viewed and having good ratings overall. The spin-off sites of P1ZZ4 Guy have been quite successful as well. The fad became really popular when sark76 donated $17.18 to a popular P1ZZ4 Guy site that was on top viewed, boosting its popularity further. In following the custom of earlier works, most P1ZZ4 GUY sites have titles and description written in l33tspeak.  While the true origin of the meme is unknown, the first known usage is an image of a with a top hat edited on. The image dates back to October 5th, 2004, first used in an image index with the file name JazzHandsKitten.jpg.[1]   Also known as "Pessimist Dog" or "Ugly Dog", Cynical Dog is another derivative of Advice Dog, and is reported to have been first seen on the popular internet imageboard, 4Chan, as a reply to a picture of an extremely overweight woman, claiming to need money to support her child and herself, due to the current economic troubles in the US. Cynical Dog is actually Sam, the ugliest Worlds Ugliest Dog from 2003-2005. Unfortunately, Sam was euthanized in November 2005 at nearly 15 years of age due to heart failure. In 1990, the film The Final Sacrafice was released in Canada. In the film, the character Zap Rowsdower (portrayed by Bruce J. Mitchell).[1] Produced for a $1,500, The Final Sacrafice was a low-budget film based on a student screenplay.   The earliest known instance of Failboat image macro appeared on 4chan's /b/ board in June 2007; the earliest reference to Failboat on /b/ can be found in an anonymous post made in April 2007 (both links are extremely NSFW). The image was first documented as a notable instance of Epic Fail at Urban Dictionary on August 15, 2007: the original failboat image In the following year, a FAILblog contributor "Russell" uploaded the original Failboat macro in January 2008. Astonished by the sheer scale of its fail-dom, readers responded by contributing an extensive series of image macros depicting similar maritime accidents. According to Lurkmore[1], the Party Van was first seen in an MS Paint comic posted to 4chan in early 2006. However, no archived mentions exist earlier than December 4th, 2006.[2] The idea evolved into image macros, where people would photoshop images of vans, trucks, and buses to be the Party Van. The images would be used in a conversations with inappropriate content, similar to how Pedobear is used in CP threads.  The scene originates from "Yu-Gi-Oh! Season 3 Episode 129: Clash in the Coliseum, Part 1 (The Sky Coliseum: Yugi vs Kaiba).[1] Kaiba uses his face down magic card, Enemy Controller, to control one of Yugi's monsters so he can summon his god monster, Obelisk the Tormentor. But at the last moment Yugi uses his face down trap card, Lightforce Sword, which prevents Obelisk from being summoned for three turns. While using Enemy Controller Kaiba shouts out "Reverse Card Open" and the button sequence "Left Right A B" in order to control the monster. The slight ridiculousness provoked some mild lulz, but it took a video remix years later to start the internet meme. While no archive of the thread exists, the phrase is believed to come from a 4chan thread on September 15th, 2007. After cracking into a woman's computer, Myspace account and college financial assistance fund, the hackers posted several pictures and videos of her on 4chan. When she became aware of this, she went to 4chan in an attempt to have them taken down. After threatening to involve the authorities, she was met with the response: “I WENT THROUGH 7 PROXIES GOOD LUCK". The following screenshot is reported to have come from the thread:[1] There is an archived thread from the same day that mentions "7 proxies" as a new slang term.[2] Afterwards 4chan implemented a wordfilter to replace "7" with over 9000. [12] As pointed out by that first quote: An user named Black_Knight gave a first glimpse of what will further be the meme by repeatedly posting on NSFW threads from SFW boards that he got fired because of stumbling upon the disturbing content which, contrary to do anything to help improving the situation, only egged trolls to post more explicit stuff. There is no traces to confirm that those events really took place as written however. Then, as said by LurkMore wiki as well: There where two primary attempts at creating a meme from the initial catchphrase that didn't catch on. After that, according to LurkMore once again, the meme really caught on 4chan's /v/ board around september 2006 when someone posted the picture of a middle-aged black male employee as a response with the "Promotion" word beside it. There is no 4chan archive from that exact period, sadly. The earliest mention of that picture in the Promotion meme comes from one of the initial photo's alteration, on a /b/ thread from May 2007. This thread was called "4chan pwnd Subeta": [ Once again, 4chan's archive, NSFW content ] http://4chanarchive.org/brchive/dspl_thread.php5?thread_id=26139544&x=4chan+pwnd+subeta#26141116 Using a low-resolution web cam in their college dorm room, Wei Wei (韋煒) and Huang Yixin (黃藝馨) recorded themselves lip dubbing to Back Street Boy's I Want It That Way in January 2005. The video was initially uploaded and shared within the local network on campus, but quickly spread across the Chinese web and beyond as it was an instant hit among the students. Trading Spouses follows the lives of two households, where each family trades and hosts a "guest spouse" and live together for a week. The following episodes were originally aired on November 2nd & 9th in 2005: During her stay with the exchange family, Mrs. Perrin makes several attempts to convert the hosts to Christianity. To her own dismay, this religious crusade leads to a conflict with her "temporary" spouse Chris and his three children. Upon returning home, she unleashes a fit of rage before her family, complaining that they had not been praying for her while she was sleeping in the house of the "dark side." She also refers to herself as a "God Warrior," which became embraced by online viewers.  Mac Tonight was created by the McDonald's fast food chain in 1986 and was portrayed as a lounge singer with a moon for a head. Commercials featuring the character originally ran from 1987 to 1990, though later commercials featuring Tonight were occasionally produced.[1] On November 24th, 2006, YTMND user MurdarMachene created a page titled "Murdar's Last YTMND," featuring an animated GIF of the Mac Tonight mascot paired with audio from the 1996 rap song "Gettin' It" by Too $hort (shown below).      In the description of the original video, which has since gained over 33,000,000 views, Andrew explains he started the list out of boredom during a school class. It was passed around the room and made its way back to him with dozens of additional names. The second boy in the video, Issac, reluctantly agreed to make the video despite worrying some viewers would interpret it negatively. The two recorded the video in less than 20 minutes, though have since commented they would have spent more time on it had they known how popular it would become.  The companion cube was created by project lead Kim Swift who had the idea after reading about isolated subjects falling in love with inanimate objects: "We had a long level called Box Marathon; we wanted players to bring this box with them from the beginning to the end. But people would forget about the box, so we added dialogue, applied the heart to the cube, and continued to up the ante until people became attached to the box. Later on, we added the incineration idea. The artistic expression grew from the gameplay."[1] In Portal the level that the companion cube is introduced is Test Chamber 17, and like Box Marathon, it must be used throughout the entire level in order to solve the various puzzles. During the course of the level, if you go behind the walls you may discover strange photos that suggest a previous tester had fallen in love with their companion cube: At the end of the level, you are forced to throw your companion cube into the incinerator in order to progress in the game. According to Portal writer Erik Wolpaw, this was used to introduce the player to the idea of using an incinerator: Wolpaw further noted that the need to incinerate the Weighted Companion Cube came as a result of the final boss battle design; they recognized they had not introduced the idea of incineration necessary to complete the boss battle, and by training the player to do it with the Weighted Companion Cube, found the narrative "way stronger" with its "death".[2] One of the earliest instances of flipping a movie's narrative appeared on the SomethingAwful forums[6] on May 20th, 2006 and linked on the Discarded Lies forum on May 21st, 2006.[5] The original post re-imagined Star Wars, Titanic, The Lord of the Rings, Batman Begins and Carry on Camping. Several months later, on January 3rd, 2007, the trope appeared in a question on Yahoo! Answers.[1] That June, YouTuber Bigshot210[2] uploaded an edited montage of Jaws arranged in reverse chronology. The description was nearly word for word from the Yahoo! Answers question, reading: "The story of a shark who throws-up humans until they open the beach." The video has since been removed due to a copyright claim by NBC Universal.   On November 19th, 1998, first-person shooter video game Half-Life was released by Valve.[1] At certain points throughout the game, a mysterious man in a suit and carrying a briefcase can be seen walking through Black Mesa facilities and observing the actions of the main protagonist of the series Gordon Freeman. In the final scene of the game, the man approaches Freeman, claiming that he represents certain government employees, and offer Freeman a job. G-Man (short for "governmant man") appears in all major future installations of the Half-Life series including Half-Life: Opposing Force, Half-Life 2, Half-Life 2: Episode One, Half-Life 2: Episode Two and Half-Life: Alyx, acting as an enigmatic person overseeing and controlling the game events from behind the scenes (compilation shown below). Rise and shine, Mr. Freeman. Gordon Freeman in the flesh. Or rather, in the hazard suit. I took the liberty of relieving you of your weapons; most of them were government property. As for the suit, I think you’ve earned it. The borderworld, Xen, is in our control for the time being, thanks to you. Quite a nasty piece of work you managed over there. I am impressed. That’s why I’m here, Mr. Freeman. I have recommended your services to my employers, and they have authorized me to offer you a job. They agree with me that you have limitless potential. You’ve proved yourself a decisive man, so I don’t expect you’ll have any trouble deciding what to do. If you’re interested, just step into the portal and I will take that as a yes. Otherwise…well…I can offer you a battle you have no chance of winning. Rather an anticlimax, after what you’ve just survived. Time to choose. So, Corporal Shephard, we meet at last. Please, don't think that I've been avoiding you, a great many matters require my attention in these… troubled times. I do hope you understand, and now I require a further indulgence on your part. I cannot close my report until every loose end has been tied up. The biggest embarrassment has been Black Mesa facility, but I think that's finally taken care of itself… Quite so. But there is still the lingering matter of witnesses. I admit I have a fascination with those who adapt and survive against all odds. They rather remind me of myself. If for no other reason, I have argued to preserve you for a time. While I believe a civil servant like yourself understands the importance of… discretion, my employers are not quite so trusting, and rather than continually subject you to the irresistible human temptation of telling all, we have decided to…convey you to somewhere where you can do no possible harm, and where no harm can come to you. I'm sure you can imagine there are worse alternatives. Rise and shine, Mr. Freeman. Rise and shine. Not that I wish to imply you have been sleeping on the job. No one is more deserving of a rest. And all the effort in the world would have gone to waste until…well, let's just say your hour has come again. The right man in the wrong place can make all the difference in the world. So, wake up, Mr. Freeman. Wake up and smell the ashes. …time, Dr. Freeman? Is it really that time again? It seems as if you only just arrived. You've done a great deal in a small timespan. You've done so well, in fact, that I've received some interesting offers for your services. Ordinarily, I wouldn't contemplate them. But these are extraordinary times. Rather than offer you the illusion of free choice, I will take the liberty of choosing for you…if and when your time comes around again. I do apologize for what must seem to you an arbitrary imposition, Dr. Freeman. I trust it will all make sense to you in the course of…well… I'm really not at liberty to say. In the meantime…This is where I get off. Doctor Freeman. I realize this moment may not be the most convenient for a heart-to-heart, but I had to wait until your friends were otherwise occupied. Hm. There was a time they cared nothing for Miss Vance… When their only experience of humanity was a crowbar coming at them down a steel corridor. When I plucked her from Black Mesa, I acted in the face of objections that she was a mere child and of no practical use to anyone. I have learned to ignore such naysayers when quelling them was out of the question. [breathing] Still, I am not one to squander my investments… and I remain confident she was worth far more than the initial…appraisal. That's why I must now extract from you some small repayment owed for your own survival. See her safely to White Forest, Doctor Freeman. [breathing] I wish I could do more than keep an eye on you, but I have agreed to abide by certain… restrictions. Mmm. Well… Now… Listen carefully, my dear. When you see your father, relay these words: "Prepare for unforeseen consequences." Impressive work, Ms. Vance. Gordon… Freeman? [Chuckles] Ms Vance. You wouldn't need all that to imprison Gordon Freeman. Perhaps what I am is not as important as what I can offer you in exchange for coming all this way. Some believe the fate of our worlds is inflexible. My employers disagree. They authorize me to… nudge things in a particular direction from time to time. What would YOU want nudged, Ms. Vance? Ahhh. That would be a considerably large nudge. Too large, given the interests of my employers. What if I could offer you something you don't know you want? We are in the future. This is the moment where you watch your father die. Unless…Unless you were to take matters into your own hands. Release your father, Ms. Vance. Good. As a consequence of your action, this entity will continue. And this entity will not. You ARE aware that you've proven yourself to be of extraordinary value. A previous hire has been unable -- or unwilling -- to perform the tasks laid before him. We have struggled to find a suitable replacement. Until now. I'm afraid you misunderstand the situation, Ms. Vance. G-Man is voiced by American voice actor Michael Shapiro.  The original photo was taken by Vasily Fedosenko for Reuters and can be seen in a Boston.com article. A member of the "Optimalist" heath club hacks a hole into the ice covering a canal near the village of Viazynka, Belarus on December 28, 2008. The club promotes a healthy way of living, encouraging its members to spend most of their free time in the countryside. On January 14th, 1987, action role-playing video game Zelda II: The Adventure of Link was released in Japan,[1] with the English version of the game released the following year on September 26th. In the game a villager apparently named Error[2][3] (jap. Erā) can be found in Ruto Town. In the the game, upon interaction, the character introduces himself, saying "I AM ERROR" (jap. Ore no na wa Erā da…). The name of the character is likely a part of the two-part joke about software bugs, with a similar character named Bagu, which translates to English as "bug," found in another location (shown below, right). However, due to Bagu's name not being translated in the English version of the game, the joke is less obvious than in the Japanese version. An incorrect fan theory states that "Error" could be a Japanese mistranslation of the name Errol.[4] Despite not being a mistranslation, "I AM ERROR" was widely considered "one of the biggest mistranslations of early NES games" by the general public.[4]  The name of the character comes from his favorite phrase, "omae mo nā!", which can be translated in English as "You too!" or "So do you!" Monā is believed to have been conceived from a troll thread posted on 2channel sometime in the late 1990s to early 2000s, with the earliest archived instance depicting Monâ dating back to January 3rd, 2000. In the thread titled "Test," some user constructed the Monā character with his keyboard and had him say a standard complaint about Internet forums: "You people have too much free time". The first post following up to this simply copied and pasted the artwork and said, "You too!" Others have claimed that the phrase "omae mo nā!" had been previously used on other BBS communities like Ayasii, the birthplace of Giko Neko, and Amezou, though these claims remain unconfirmed. In early 2006, a raid member of the WoW guild Wipe Club recorded audio of an attempt to complete the Onyxia raid, one of the most challenging levels at the time. As the campaign goes awry, guild leader Dives can be heard delivering a series of explatative orders and interjections, expressing his horror and dismay. On March 25th, 2006, World of Warcraft player Deluthor created a Flash animation to accompany the audio recording. The video is in the style of early Group X videos, featuring hand-drawn stick figures, simple animations, intentionally incorrect spelling and using related images to represent individual words (for example, using the image of a set of scales to represent the word "way", which sounds the same as "weigh"). While the original video is no longer available on its original platform, YouTuber Alachas1985 uploaded the animation on December 8th, 2007. In less than 12 years, the video has received more than 8.9 million views (shown below). One of the earliest uses of STFU in online conversation appeared in the newsgroup alt.comp.virus[1] in a discussion among Wordbasic programmers in February 1999, in which a user named Kryten asked if anyone still coded viruses for Microsoft Word 95/96. In response, another user named THE PHOENIX posted a series of alerts saying “BAD KRYTEN, NOW STFU, AND GO TO YOUR ROOM!!” that would crash Outlook Express once it was opened.   The Chun Brothers' performance of "Jung Hwa Ban Jum" first appeared in 2001 and circulated on the Korean web, where the duo gained their nickname as they introduced themselves as Maeng Chun-sik and Maeng Chun-sam, which are (presumably) pseudonyms that sound cheesy to those who are familiar with Korean language. After the video became a viral hit, it was later revealed that the two are actually close friends of the same age (born in 1982), Choi Chang-guk (최창국) and Kim Jun-ho (김준호). Although the original video goes by the name of "Chin2" on the English-speaking web, it is more commonly known as "Jung Hwa Ban Jum" (Chinese Restaurant) on the Korean internet. The birth of Akita Neru is deeply related to a bunch of unfortunate events on mass media and major search engines which took place in the middle of October, 2007.[2][3] Those incidents led Japanese internet users to have strong doubt over the existence of the Anti-Miku negative campaign created by Japanese major advertising agencies and TV stations. In this situation, many strange comments had been posted to a series of threads in 2channel's /newsplus/ (news coverage for current topics) board, which worked as a sort of the headquarters against this topic. Those comments were usually posted at intervals of a few seconds, and always contained messages such as "It's our misunderstood. Let's call it quits.", "I'm tired." or "It's over. I'm going to sleep." in a quite similar style. 2channel users doubted that trolls of posting those comments were "provocateurs" organized by media companies and advertising agencies which wanted to calm down this situation. The situation was completely changed on October 20th, by a trap post with a URL which recorded and displayed IP address of clicked users. One of the domains captured by this trap was identified that it belonged to an online marketing company which worked on online forums such as 2channel to moderate reputations of client companies. At that moment, when all users became convinced of the existence of provocateurs, all troll posts ended. Based on this prologue, the character was created to poke fun at those poor trolls by user Smith Hioka (スミス・ヒオカ). The first illustration titled "Kakikoloid: Akita Neru" (Post-loid: Akita Neru) was posted to 2channel's /newsplus/ board on November 1st, 2007.[4] Her name coined by him, Akita Neru, actually came from trolls' impressive comments "I'm tired." (飽きた, Akita) and "Going to Sleep." (寝る, Neru). "DEN2" tatoo on her left arm refers to Dentsu[5], a name of the advertising agency under suspicion in this incident. Besides, she has a cell phone because the IP address of a troll belonged to a proxy service to browse HTML pages in cell phones. It is unclear when or where the symbol originated, but many believe it is based off a logo for Stussy[1], a clothing company based in Irvine, California. However, others question that claim since there's no irrefutable evidence that the symbol ever appeared on any of Stussy's clothing lines and the symbol itself is believed to date back as far as the late 1950's. Some believe the symbol was created by unknown graffiti artists in the past.    According to Wikipedia, and other articles[3] Giko seems to have been created around 1999 in a place called "Ayasii World (あやしいわーるど, lit. "Strange World")[4], which is known to be one of the first Japanese underground internet bulletin board. Then, the same year, it was introduced to newly created 2channel message board. It got so popular there that Giko became one of 2channel's favorite mascots. The Japanese versions of Wikipedia have a clearer explanation of the Giko phenomenon. However, there are 2 presumptions about its date of birth: The "cat giko"[5] article suggests that it was created the 3rd of December 1998 because some log entries say so: These logs can be found in .zip format at the following link: http://www.ge.st98.arena.ne.jp/gikoneko/img/981206.zip (Defunct) On the other hand, the "cat pseudoarchaic" article[6] retracing most of Giko history with all the derivatives, tends to think it was created in July the 20th 1999: That latter has many links redirecting to Ayasii World's log search, but when we go there, we meet with an access denied message.[7] In fact, this decrepancy in the dates is what separate 2 different thoughts about Giko's creation: One that think the character was born with the first ASCII picture made of him (December 1998) and another thinking the true Giko character was born when its personality was established (July 1999). Indrick Boreale was a character from the Dawn of War: Soulstorm (2008) , an expansion to the Real-Time Strategy video game Dawn of War (2004). Indrick Boreale is voiced by Scott McNeil. In a cutscene, Commander Boreale gives a speech to his fellow Space Marines, where he explains his stronghold's defenses, and how they are guaranteed to win. The cutscene is notorious for showcasing Boreale's rather heavy accent. (The original, unedited cutscene in video form is shown below, as well as the speech in text form.) The time is not to be lost! Battle Brothers! We are the emperor! If we fight in glory. We will descend upon the name of our headquarters. We will descend upon the emperor's fury There is at our door. We have placed numerous beacons, allowing for our honor, as Blood Ravens, as Blood Ravens, as Blood Ravens, as space marines, and devastating defensive deep strike! Our perimeter has been prepared in the event that our enemies should be lost! Battle brothers; space prepared to deep strike! Our perimeter has been prepared in the emperor! If we fight in space, prepared to deep strikes. The Codex Astartes names this maneuver steel rain. We fight for multiple simultaneous and we fight for our door. We are the emperor! If we will overwhelm them, we shall not die. No, it We fight for our honor, as space marines, and we fight for our battle brothers are stationed in the name of the emperor! The speech also has been edited to match his accent. (Shown Below) "Tehre is noh time to beh lohst! Battle Brothars! Spehss Mahrens, todeh the enemeh is at oua doar! We know oua duteh and we will do eet. We fight for our honor as Blod Rehvens, as SPESS MAHRENS, and we fight in the nehme of the Empra!

We will descend upon the foe, we will ovawhelm them – we will leave none alive! Meanwhile oua ground fawses will ensue the full defense of oua headkwaters We are the spehss mahrens! WE ARE THE EMPRA'S FUREH!" The phrase "enjoy your aids"[sic] was originally posted as an image macro on 4chan's /b/ board[1] by a user named "Rabbi Bob Hitler" in 2005. Featuring a character image of Heero Yuy from the popular anime series Gundam Wing, the phrase gradually became widely adopted as an insult by the rest of 4chan community at large.  - November the 5th 1995, Jeff "CJayC" Veasey created GameFAQs.com, a website meant to be a giant database for video game related informations, cheat codes, reviews, game saves, screenshots and so worth, almost all of which is submitted by volunteer contributors. - November the 7th 1999, Message Boards, coded by Veasey himself, were added to his website. The first boards were meant to facilitate game discussion but, further on, other board categories with different purposes were added. One of them in particular will greatly caught attention: The LUE board, also known as Life, the Universe and Everything board According to several articles : That is where the "Y helo thar" meme came to life. At first, the expression was often used along with the buttsecks slang, which was a synonym of the "se><0r t3h f4c3" expression (the embedding Urban Dictionary explanation doesn't work due to leetspeak but you can be redirected to it via the buttsecks one). That is, the initial use was roughtly to invite someone in sexual intercourses and was more of a trolling tool toward newcomers. The sentence became so popular that it was featured in a 2000 contest called Best GameFaq's word/phrase, ending up just before the Quarter-Finals, ironically defeated by pwned. While the origin of the phrase is unknown, the first reference to it is an Urban Dictionary article[1] for "necroposting" created on January 17th, 2004. Portrait de l'artiste sous les traits d'un moqueur (English: Self-portrait of the artist in the guise of a mockingbird), which depicts Ducreux grinning smugly while pointing his finger towards the viewer, was completed circa 1793. Over two centuries later in 2009, Ducreux' portrait was turned into an image macro with a caption reading "Disregard Females, Acquire Currency," an archaic reinterpretation of lyrics from Notorious B.I.G's 1995 hit single Get Money. More recently, the line "F*ck Bitches, Get Money" was also featured in Lil Wayne's 2005 track Money on My Mind. Since becoming popular on 4chan, Meme Generator and other lulz-friendly communities, the image macro has spawned an extensive pool of variations.  The phrasal template "In before X" is derived from its earlier form of expression "in before the lock," which was widely used on 4chan and other imageboards to leave a marking in a thread that is soon to be cycled out without being archived or removed by the admin. The earliest Urban Dictionary definitions[1][2] for the expressions "in before the lock" and "in b4" were posted on March 9th, 2006 and April 30th, 2007, respectively. The earliest archived mention of "in b4" can be found in a 4chan thread[3] posted on March 31st, 2007, although its usage most likely predates this. On April 26th, 2007, an anonymous Paheal[1] user posted the earliest known usage of the phrase in the "source link" field of a Rule 34 post featuring the Family Guy character Meg and Lois having sex. In the source link field, the poster wrote, "What is this I don't even" (shown below). On March 2, 2008, the picture "teh itteh bitteh kitteh committeh" was posted on icanhascheezburger, the lolcat site. The picture is of a man holding many kittens in his arms, all squished together in a group. The earliest time that picture was posted on the internet is believed to be from the Russian website muhom.org, labeled as "Kittens wholesale." The picture was dated October 30, 2006. However, the picture used for the captioned image is from Funnyjunk (as seen in the bottom right-hand corner of the picture.) The caption "teh itteh bitteh kitteh committeh" is lolspeak for "The itty bitty kitty committee". The picture was very well-received, and variations flowed forth. The comic strip portrays two people bearing shirts "pro-skub" and "anti-skub" who ultimately fight due to each others stance on this product, with the final panel bearing an image of a container of Skub. "Skub" Itself is portrayed as a container of cream similar to hair wax.[1] In January 2002, Something Awful announced a photoshop contest against rival site Fark.com[9] with the topic "TV Shows That Would Never Be Made." One of the Something Awful submissions[10] entered by user The Yellow Yell was entitled "The Joy Of Furries," depicting Bob Ross drawing a humanlike animal laying in a provocative position. The base photo (shown left above) is considered the most well-known image[3] of the late artist; it has appeared on his estate’s website[7] as well as various merchandise relating to his television series including DVDs[4], books[5] and painting kits.[6] The meme Francis Hates X come from the popular game Left 4 Dead, a survival-horror/action shooter game developed by VALVe Software. In the game, players take the role of 1 of 4 survivors, fighting through hordes of infected humans attempting to reach a safe house or be rescued. The survivors are Bill, a Vietnam war veteran; Zoey, an average college girl and fan of horror movies/novels; Louis, the assistant manager at an electronics store, and father of the Grabbin' Peelz meme; and Francis, your average tattooed biker. The meme stems from the dialogue of the character Francis, who in the game has the habit of declaring he hates whatever situation the player currently encounters. For Example: (Opens safe room door and sees a large staircase) Francis: I hate stairs. or Louis: We should head for the river! Francis: I hate the water. Francis' seemingly random hatred gives him the appearance of hating everything. This has spawned multiple images, and is also quite commonly referenced in dialogue.    First released in Germany, Moskau proved to be fairly popular within the disco-pop audience, and would be released in Australia in 1980; the year of the 1980 Moscow Olympics. Australia's Channel 7 would use this song as the theme to their television coverage of the Moscow Olympics. The song became a big hit in Australia, staying at #1 for five weeks, as well with becoming an underground sensation within the Soviet Union.[1]  On December 9, 2007, a NND user Shimashima-P[1] uploaded a stick figure animation of a guy playing the flute while doing bizarre slash frantic dance moves. Comically titled "Soaring Energy: Flute-playing Elf / Post-Quit Symptom Level 5"[2], the hand-drawn animation made vague references to symptoms of anxieties and struggles experienced by ex-cigarette smokers. But regardless of the artist's original motif, its catchy flute melodies and slapstick dance routine eventually caught on beyond the niche group and led many others to create their own. In March of 2008, Nintendo released the game Super Smash Bros. Brawl, a fighting game for the Wii. One of the playable characters was Ike, a swordman from Fire Emblem and the commander of the Greil Mercenaries. Three quotes from Ike in SSBB quickly became popular on the Internet. The quotes themselves where never actually said in any of the Fire Emblem games, but are not out of character as his in game actions imply. The Fire Emblem games are famous for the large deep cast and inclusion of permanent death, meaning that once a character falls in battle the game continues without them (with the exception of a main character, who will cause a game over when he or she dies), making every ally precious. Some of Ike's power ups in the game, such as "Provoke", will force enemies to attack him first if he is within their range, effectively shielding his allies. However, in some instances where Ike is forced to fight his former comrades (a often situation in Raidient Dawn), without hesitation he will fight them to the death. Also, oftentimes before Ike engages a Boss a short dialog will play. This dialog will usually have Ike and the Opponent resolve to fight to the death. The dialogues will usually end with lines to the effect of "Have at you!" or "Ready your Weapon!", so the same effect "Prepare Yourself" is used. The physical gesture of "kneeling on the ground in defeat" has been previously portrayed through popular films, TV shows and mangas, both for comedic and dramatic effect. When used in a serious light, this posture is also known as dogeza, a sign of self-abasement used in formal apologies and to request great favors from persons of higher social status. According to Wikipedia[8], the emoticon was first used in late 2002 on the Japanese website Techside's FAQ Forum. On the forum, a poster asked about a cable cover typing "＿|￣|○" to show a cable and its cover. Others commented that it looked like a kneeling person, and the symbol became popular. These comments were soon deleted as they were considered off-topic. However, one of the first corresponding reactions can be found on the thread in Techside Chitchat Forum (Techside一言板。) dating back to December 23th, 2002.  The slogan was originally produced for a scene prop on the production set of The X-Files[1], an American cult sci-fi TV series created by screenwriter Chris Carter. The series ran for nine seasons from September 1993 to May 2002. In the series, the slogan can be seen on a poster[2] hanging in the office wall of FBI Special Agent Fox Mulder (played by David Duchovny). With the international success of the X-Files series, both the slogan and the poster came to represent believers of UFO and extraterrestrial life. While the production team has not officially commented on the origins of the poster, a nonprofit research group known as Free Community of Interests for the Border and Spiritual Sciences and Ufological Studies (FIGU) Community[3] have claimed that the picture is based on an actual UFO taken by photographer and self-claimed UFO contactee Billy Eduard Albert Meier. While it is more likely that Monorail Cat was one of the first products of /b/'s Caturday, the earliest known instance of monorail cat was posted on the website Catmas[1] on November 2nd, 2006. The picture (shown below) features a cat resting on over a metal-framed mirror with its legs tucked inward, which makes the cat look like a monorail. The post was captioned, "It's been a while since we've posted a cat picture, but we're back!" One of the earliest known uses of BRB appeared in a log from a Apple II Development Forum[13], held on January 3rd, 1989. During the chat session, at least two different users wrote "brb" to denote that they were temporarily stepping away from the chat room. The origin of Torgo comes from a famous cult movie known as Manos: The Hands of Fate. The Torgo character is played by the actor John Reynolds , and yes, he hasn't been in any movies since then. The character of Torgo started to become popular when the show Mystery Science Theater 3000 (Also known as MST3K) debuted it on their show. The Video  In an interview with Ultra Kawaii[1], Ibsen revealed that he created the video while he was a senior in high school after taking pictures of his cat Kayla before leaving for school. While scrolling through the photos, Ibsen observed that it appeared as if the cat was dancing in stop motion animation, which inspired him to create the music video. Ibsen originally uploaded the video to his website G-Shack[6] on March 3rd, 2004. The original Ibsen video was uploaded to YouTube[4] by user Batman1225 on October 19th, 2005. As of March 2012, the Batman1225 upload has over 4.3 million views, the Steve Ibsen upload has over 2.4 million views and a Facebook[11] page has over 13,400 likes.

This picture is the origin picture    While the exact origins of Rape Face ar unknown, it began to appear in 2008. One of the earliest instances is the image below, of Link, from "The Legend of Zelda". The image was posted by the user linkrapefaceplz on Spetember 7, 2008, and was a redraw of an image of Spongebob Squarepants from the episode "Just One Bite". Outside the context of video-editing, the term "inappropriate soundtrack" has been occasionally used by film reviewers and bloggers in film review articles. The majority of "Inappropriate Soundtrack" videos originate from Something Awful forums, as cited by active contributors to the series on YouTube. The earliest known discussion about inappropriate soundtracks on Something Awful was posted on May 5th, 2002, in a thread titled "Ruin movies with inappropriate soundtracks.. again,"[1] which suggests that there had been previous threads relating to the topic. Although the original videos have been removed, the movie review website Top5 Movies published a two-part list titled "The Top 8 Inappropriate Soundtrack Songs"[2][3] on June 11th, 2004: "Noob" originated from the word "Newbie"[13], a term originally used in the 1960s–1970s among U.S. troops during the Vietnam War to refer to a new man in a unit. There are multiple theories regarding the etymology of the term "newbie"; some assert that it may have come from the word "newie," which referred to a neophyte or a beginner as early as since 1850s, while others point to the British public school slang "new boy" or "new blood" that emerged around the same time. The fist bump gesture may have originated in the late 1800s as a way for boxer’s to greet one another while wearing thick gloves.[6] St. Louis Cardinals baseball player Stan Musial, who played in the Major League Baseball from 1941 to 1963, has been cited as the possible inventor of the gesture as an informal greeting, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.[5] The earliest known ASCII iteration of a bro fist was posted on the imageboard 4chan[1] on October 16th, 2008 (shown below). IF YOU DONT POST THIS TO 5 BROS THEN YOU ARENT A BRO  The audition took place in Buenos Aires in early 2006 and the final version of commercial was briefly aired in Argentina before getting banned on the grounds of violence. In the beginning of the clip, you can see the guy from the audition for a hot second. There is little information regarding the XBOX lady's identity, but there is a YouTube clip identifying her name as Sara Solnik, a freelance actor who played a minor role in the 2004 film J-18. Unfortunately, Mrs. Solnik passed away in April 2007, according to the obituaries released by Argentinian Actors' Association.  Towards the end of the film, Charlie and Grandpa Joe approach Wonka, played by Gene Wilder, about a promised lifetime supply of chocolate. Wonka denies him as Joe and Charlie stole Fizzy Lifting Drinks and got his ceiling dirty in a previous scene. Since the release of the film, the quote has been referenced in pop culture for many decades. In May 2001, a shortened version of the quote, "now good day sir," was introduced as a catchphrase of Fez in the popular TV sitcom series That '70s Show. In real life, seals are used to signify an image of authenticity or credibility of an institution, whatever it can be. Different types of coats of arms exist since the predynastic Egypt and the Heraldry as a profession according to Wikipedia. In the late 2004, a website, SealCreator was created to promote and sell a program called "Seal Maker" while offering a free trial version of their product here.   The character known today as Pedobear used to be simply known as "Kumar" or "Kumā" (bear) on the Japanese textboard 2channel. It originated as an ASCII art image created by ぶる ~ 3, who was instrumental in starting an emoticon-only board on 2ch.[1] One of the earliest 2ch threads with this ASCII was posted on February 27th, 2003.[2] The bear would be posted as a reaction to threads where the original poster would be fishing for attention, as a way to highlight the thread was an obvious troll.[3] The ASCII character gradually evolved to encompass several lines instead of just one, before becoming a drawn character[4], popular enough to be turned into papercraft.[5]  The image originated from the book "Muppet Babies Classic Nursery Rhymes" it was in the image for tongue twister "She Sells Seashells" pictured below. Special thanks to user Redspear for the picture. The comic panel was originally taken on page 10 from the H-doujin (Hentai doujn) Sperma 4, created by Todd Special, which was based on the video game Persona 4. The comic page (shown below, left) originally shown antagonist Tohru Adachi telling the main heroes to stay out of his way, after being found out about his murderous background. According to Encyclopedia Dramatica[1], the edited image (shown below, right) was originally posted on 4chan by anonymous user sometime during 2008. The earliest archived association of the phrase with his character was the /a/[2] (Anime&Manga) board on December 27th, 2008, along with the earliest known archived posting of the image on the same board[3] on January 30th, 2009. The first game in the series, Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 64, was released in 1999 with a dozen of playable characters (Captain Falcon, Donkey Kong, Fox, Jigglypuff, Kirby, Link, Luigi, Mario, Ness, Pikachu, Samus and Yoshi), followed by the release of Super Smash Bros. Melee for the GameCube in November 2001 with a fresh batch of 13 Nintendo franchise characters (Bowser, Dr. Mario, Falco, Ganondorf, Ice Climbers, Marth, Mewtwo, Mr. Game & Watch, Peach, Pichu, Roy, Sheik, Young Link and Zelda), which set up the fans' expectation for inclusion of new characters with every sequel release in the franchise. However, fan-made predictions and theories about the next-generation characters didn't take off until the announcement of Super Smash Bros. Brawl for Wii at Nintendo's pre-E3 press conference in May 2006. The hype surrounding its character roster was further boosted by the inclusion of playable characters from third-party franchises, such as Solid Snake (Metal Gear) and Sonic (Sonic the Hedgehog). In January 2006, a strange picture of a cat stuck in a trash can surfaced on a Myspace subpage hosted by LazyBoy's Underwear Goes Inside the Pants project. It is believed to be one of the earliest instances to use the catchphrase "X is not amused" [citation needed / still researching]:  The Melancholy of Haruhi-chan, the anime series depicting the SOS Brigade in a cute way, had been released on the official YouTube channel of the publisher Kadokawa from February to May of 2009. In the 12th episode released on March 20th, 2009. Kyon and Itsuki must surprise the girl's of the brigade, and resort to acting like hosts (shown below, left). The YouTube user ShadowRocksMySock[1] parodied this "piiii" noise by using something the internet hates, Twilight (shown below, right). The video, entitled "Twilight Makes Mikuru Cry," was originally uploaded to YouTube around June 2009. The product itself is offered through two companies listed on amazon.com: goofficesolutions.com and comfortchannel.com. In the similar light as the three wolves howling at the moon meme where amazon users poke fun of the potential horrors of using the product known as "mobile laptop desk". Includes images of horrific accidents implying using the product would or has lead to said wreck. Here are some reviews: Wow is this thing great! I use it as a "mini-bar" when the friends and I go out to the bars. I can quickly fix multiple shots of tequila for myself and the friends as we drive from one bar to the next. We also discovered that if you place a pillow on top of it and turn on the cruise control you can catch quick naps on the interstate. If you swerve to the left or right the rumble strips on the road wake you up in plenty of time before you get into trouble. I can now take longer trips without being tired! Also, i am now dating a midget and she fits nicely on the steering wheel desk which allows us to experiment sexually while driving. This thing is like WD-40 or duct tape, it is a million and one uses!" This has been a total lifesaver. It allows me to prop my sheet music against the wheel, allowing me to play the guitar with both hands while driving." I loved my Laptop Steering Wheel Desk so much I got one for my 90yr old mother. She is an avid crossword puzzle fan and now she can work on them while she is driving back and forth from bingo at the senior center. One cautionary note be careful of those jerks that stop at yellow lights, my poor mother rear ended one and the airbag drove the desk back into her stomach which ruptured her spleen, well after a short down time I'm glad to say she is back on the road and cranking out those NY Times crosswords once again. Thanks Laptop Steering Wheel Desk you have made my mothers life more complete." One of the earliest appearances of this character in rage comics was in a thread[1] posted on eBaum’s World's message board on November 27th, 2008. The comic illustrated a person’s anger towards American automotive companies GM, Chrysler and Ford during the 2008 automotive industry crisis[2], in which the main character's ill wish against "The Big Three" companies becomes a reality with the CNN's announcement of their bankruptcies. The original reference to "sauce" meaning "source" comes from Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, a 2002 anime series that was first aired on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim in November 2004 (U.S. release). In episode 9, titled "C: The Man Who Dwells in the Shadows of the Net – CHAT! CHAT! CHAT!" (ネットの闇に棲む男 CHAT! CHAT! CHAT!), one of the scenes takes place in a virtual-reality chatroom where one avatar asks for sources and another mocks him with the phrases "sarce" and "soy sauce" (shown below). Beginning in 2004 on 4chan, it became somewhat common for users to ask for the source of anything by typing "SOURCE!" or "SOURCE PLZ!" right from the start. Moot, 4chan's creator who was inspired by the show's reference, decided to add a word filter changing every occurrence of "source" to "sauce."[1] The word filter has since been deactivated, but the slang took over on 4chan as a result of its use, subsequently spreading to other sites and platforms in the following years. It is unknown where the nickname "Malleo" and the vectorized image surfaced on the web; however, the sprites it is based off of can be found in the 1992 DOS version of the educational game Mario Is Missing![1] In the game, the sprite (alongside the sprite that Weegee is based off of) is seen in the intro and ending cutscenes of the game.  First published between the years 2001-2002, Gyo is a horror manga created by popular horror writer/artist Junji Ito. The 2 volumes of the manga tells the tale of when a series of disturbing spider legged fishes begin surfacing. Also included are two short stories, one of which interestingly enough is The Engima of Amigara Fault, from which the It's Slowly Coming This Way aka Drr meme origanated from. The original pages from which the exploitable is from show one of these spider legged creatures, this one the form of a Shark, and are in chapter 4, pages 6 and 16[1]. Despite the similarity in the scenes, the two pages do not actually occur after each other.  Dr. Rabbit was used as a mascot for Colgate-Palmolive's toothpaste brand, Colgate, prominently in the mid-to-late 1990s. He appeared in five videos: Dr. Rabbit in the Incredible Ride (1994), Dr. Rabbit's World Tour (1998), Dr. Rabbit Comes to School (2003), Dr. Rabbit and the Legend of Tooth Kingdom (2004), and How to Have a Bright Smile. Dr. Rabbit's World Tour is arguably the most well-known of these videos. Weegee is based on a playable character in the DOS game Mario is Missing[1], released by Software Toolworks in 1992. It was the only game to feature Luigi as a starring character until 2001's Luigi's Mansion. A version of this original game is currently available to play on Nintendo8.[2] The character's awkward posture and unwavering stare was first pointed out by a user named MonkeyInCloset on LUElinks forums, now known as End of the Internet[3], on August 11th, 2007. He also posted a vectorized version that would eventually become the exploitable that day. The name "Weegee," is an Engrish mistranslation of Luigi's name due to the lack of equivalent character for pronouncing the alphabet letter "L" in Japanese. One of the earliest instances of the exploitable appearing with this name was in a thread on 4chan's /b/ (random) forum on December 13th, 2007[4].  The origin of the myth can be traced back to the male-prevalent days of Usenet, particularly in the virtual Multi-User Dungeons (MUDs), a genre of text-based online role-playing games and predecessor to MMORPG like World of Warcraft. During this era, it became a routine practice among male players to falsely pose as girls to solicit gifts or other unfair advantages. Such prevalence of gender swapped deception in MUDs was first noted in 1993 by American sociologist Amy Bruckman in her research paper "Gender Swapping on the Internet": "Many people, both male and female, enjoy the attention paid to female characters. Male players will often log on as female characters and behave suggestively, further encouraging sexual advances. Pavel Curtis has noted that the most promiscuous and sexually aggressive women are usually played by men. If you meet a character named "FabulousHotBabe," she is almost certainly a he in real life." The practice has since remained a popular trolling technique in online conversations and more recently, as an integral part of griefing in the context of online gaming. In addition, such stereotype of the average Internet user as "a geeky male who is single and desperately seeking interaction with the other sex" became further amplified and perpetuated through its frequent portrayal in popular TV shows, films and novels. One of the earliest instances of the expression was posted in a discussion thread titled "“So my sister has her hot friend over” on the forums for gaming site Tribal War[1] on June 20th, 2003. In the thread, the OP (original poster) boasted about how they were having a pillow fight, to which forum member Blitzkrieg responded: “Obligatory ‘pix or it didn’t happen.’” Though the thread lasted several hours, BlackMyst never produced photographic evidence. This flash animation was created by deviantArt user spookydoom[1] on September 1st, 2005.[2] The Youtube video was uploaded by Alcaka[3] on January 24th 2006. This was a person who had stumbled upon the animation and decided to post it on Youtube to share it with others. As of November 2012, the video has over 2,000,000 views. My name is Cloud I have a sword I fight Cactuars Because I'm Bored I like to ride on Chocobos It's better than Having Afros And when I go Into an Inn Fifteen seconds It's day again And I will use A phoenix down So when I die I will not Frown Because I am Cloud My Hair defies all gravity And I can't have too many potions Or I might get cavities If I can't slice you Then that's ok I'll use my magic Anyway And I will defeat That Sephiroth Because he's not David Lee Roth One reason why the animation has been so successful may be because the cuteness of Chibi Cloud (Omega meaning very and Kawaii meaning Cute). Cuteness (take Babies laughing for example) has a long history of appeal. The song also had silly lyrics set to a catchy tune. On April 16th, 2006, YTMND user Artman40 created the site "Super Mario XP"[2] featuring a pixel art mosaic of Mario made of titlebar buttons (minimize, maximize and close) from Windows XP. The background music is a rendition of the Super Mario Brothers' Underworld Theme by Koji Kondo, recreated with sound effects from the Windows XP operating system as well as the sound of mouse clicks. According to an article in the online video news blog Videogum,[3] Gormley began making green screen music videos with local Florida musician Phil Thomas Katt in 2006. On August 1st, 2007, Katt uploaded Gormley's music video for the song "Little Wings" to TheUnchartedZone YouTube channel (shown below). The video remained relatively obscure until January of 2009 and subsequently recieved over 920,000 views within the next three years. On April 10th, 2003, Something Awful[1] hosted a contest challenging its visitors to create and share "anagrammed movie posters," as part of the site's weekly Photoshop Phriday event. The thread was met with positive feedback from other users and brought in over 55 parody submissions based on anagrammed titles of films released between the late 90s to early 2000s, including Sign (anagrammed as Sing_), The Ring (The Grin_) and Titanic (Cat In It). The site brought back the anagram challenge on July 8, 2004 and again on July 4th, 2008.[2][3] The Frantics' enduring catchphrase was introduced to the Canadian TV audiences through their CBC radio program Frantic Times, which ran from 1981 to 1984. During these years, the group began crafting a comedic trope in which an unsuspecting character gets suddenly kicked in the face by the speaker who yells "boot to the head!" The skit was first released in 1987 as the title track of the group's second audio album Boot to the Head and further popularized in the United Stated by the California-based radio host DJ Demento in 1991. The earliest known discussion thread about the phrase and the album was posted on the Usenet group rec.music.dementia by Eric J. Bowersox on September 24th, 1989. "Last Will and Temperament," the reading of the will of a quite obnoxious dead guy (I have heard this one; it, too, features that magic phrase which sends my roommate and myself into hysterics :-).) More recently in 2007, a Phoenix Wright tribute sketch surfaced on YouTube and spawned off a series of MAD-style parodies.   Ogre: Aargh! Wizard #1: Lightning Bolt! Lightning Bolt! Lightning Bolt! Lightning Bolt! Lightning Bolt! Wizard #2: Sleep! Wizard #1: Lightning Bolt! Lightning Bolt! Wizard #2: Sleep! Wizard #1: Lightning Bolt! Ogre: Death! Wizard #1: Death! Ogre: Urgh! (Dies) In 2003, a video called "Ogre Battle" began circulating within LARP communities. That video started to get attention from non-LARPers, mainly laughing at it because it showed a man dressed in bizarre clothing yelling "Lightning Bolt!", "Sleep!" and "Death!" while throwing what seemed to be pieces of paper to another man disguised as the ogre. Because flash-based video players didn't become common until around 2004, some people hosted the video directly on their websites, but most links are now dead. One of the first website to host a streaming version of the video was MilkAndCookies in September 2003. As one can see in the comment section of that website, the reactions were mostly negative. But, at the same time, this Lightning Bolt guy became instantly famous. According to Brandon Boucher, the real name behind the Lightning Bolt guy, the video was shot during the summer of 2003 as an ad for a website called Legends Role Playing.  Although the exact first use of the term "forced meme" online is unknown, it likely emerged alongside early meme culture in the mid-2000s. One such example of an early discussion of the term comes from a blog post, titled "What Do You Call A Meme That Isn't A Meme," on the site Successful Blog[4] from April 23rd, 2007. In this post, user ME Strauss uses the term "forced meme" to describe memes that are spread through a concerted effort. Most instances of forced memes are small-scale efforts by an individual to create a meme, but occasionally through a company or brand that will attempt to force a meme through viral marketing or astroturfing in order to promote their product, such as Circus Afro for the 2012 film Madagascar 3.[1][2]  This song is written by Jun Ishikawa, the main composer of Kirby series. According to Nico Nico Pedia[2], an internet encyclopedia for NND, this song began to be used in MADs on NND in the second half in 2008. The earliest MAD video reusing this song was posted to NND on September 27th, 2008, titled "Shu-by of the Star 3 : Heat Canyon" (【松岡修造】星岡ビィ造３　ヒートキャニオン【星のカービィ】). This was also a derivative of Shuzo Matsuoka phenomenon.   The first known photo of Mr. Bhat appeared on Jihad Watch on September 16, 2006. Epitomizing the Western perception of Islamic extremism, the boy's photo was popularly syndicated in newspaper/magazine articles about Muslim protests, from the protest against Danish cartoons and the Pope to Israeli military actions in Gaza and President Bush's visit to India. The "X Y is X" redundancy formula comes from The Simpsons, Season 11, Episode 9, entitled "The Grift of the Magi" written by Tom Martin. The episode originally aired on December 19th, 1999. Excerpt from script: (relevant quote marked in bold) Lindsay: Now, that's market research you can take to the bank – the money bank. Phil: I just wish those second-graders would stop jerking us around. - "Grift of the Magi" Lindsay Naegle and Phil watch through another chalkboard to the class formerly taught by Ms. Hoover. Ralph: Fun toys are fun! Teacher: Well-said, Ralph, but we're trying to come up with a name for a toy. Janey: Mrs. Fun? Teacher: Not bad. Ralph: Fun? Teacher: Ralph, there are no right or wrong answers, but if you don't pipe down, I'm giving you an F. According to Wikipedia[3], the first photograph to capture a flying bullet in mid-air was taken by Austrian physicist Peter Sacher in 1886. During the early days of film photography, a series of advancements in high speed photography drastically improved the likelihood of capturing well-timed photographs, including the invention of high speed film camera by German scientists in 1916, rotating mirror camera by Cearcy Miller and rapatronic shutters by MIT professor Harold “Doc” Edgerton[18] in the 1940s. Up until the late 1990s, the production of well-timed photographs was mostly limited to professional photographers and photojournalists, but it quickly became more accessible in the 2000s with the arrival of consumer-grade digital camera, which gave a new life to the use of continuous shots and introduced the instant on-screen preview feature. It is like that perfectly timed photos rose to popularity on forums and BBS sites under various names in different parts of the Internet.      The phrase "Red Leader Standing By" comes from a memorable scene in Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope where the rebel alliance is launching their assault on the Death Star. Approaching the enemy trench zones, the Red Squadron leader performs a roll call over the radio: Red Leader: "All wings check in." Red 3: "Red 3 standing by." Red 6: "Red 6 standing by." Luke Skywalker: "Red 5 standing by" Red Buttons: "Red Buttons standing by." Redd Foxx: "Redd Foxx standing by." Big Red: "Big Red standing by." The earliest instance of "Red Leader Standing by" roll-call thread can be found in a Jedi Council Forums thread created in May 2001.[1] "Red Leader" style roll-calling has been extensively used in imageboards and discussion forums. Clippy, a paperclip with googly eyes and expressive eyebrows, was designed by Kevan J. Atteberry[9] to serve as a user-friendly troubleshooter for people using Office applications including Word and Excel. For instance, typing an address followed by "Dear" would cause Clippy to pop up with and a variety of pre-determined messages, including "Hey! It looks like you're writing a letter!" before offering to help walk you through the process. The earliest known use of the photograph was posted by Dark Circuit[1] user paris tuna "on March 18th, 2007. The post is in the form of a Demotivational Poster featuring a screaming cockatiel with the text "Blockatiel: PLEEZ MOEV BIRD!1" In over a decade, the image (shown below) has been viewed more than 2,000 times.     On September 27th 2009, on a forum hosted by Gamekult, a French website about video games, a user named Noyart (later revealed to be a 13-year-old boy named Gabriel) created a topic[1] because he was in the middle of a dilemma in buying a game console and he wanted to know the pros and cons of a PSP (shown below). While his message isn't that bad written, a peculiar sentence stood out: MER IL ET FOU That sentence is written in all caps and initially emphasized that he anticipated being pointed out as crazy for planning to buy a PSP, supposedly because that game console, according to the video game media at the time, had some selling difficulties throughout the world. MER IL ET FOU's in-joke is hard to translate. The sentence means But he's crazy! or He's crazy lol!, only with misgrammar commonly found in Lolcats. Mer, in this particular case, could either be a mistyping of the word mais, French for but, or a mistyping of a famous French acronym: MDR, from Mort De Rire (Dead from laughter in English) which is the French equivalent of LOL. It should be noted that et, French for and is also a miswriting of est, the French third-person singular conjugation of the verb be.  The catchphrase originated in the pilot episode "Rabbot" for the Adult Swim cartoon show Aqua Teen Hunger Force, which aired on December 30th, 2000. In the episode, after a rabbit-like robot named "Rabbot" escapes from a laboratory, the character Dr. Weird laments the circumstance by exclaiming "What has science done?" On March 31st, 2002, the earliest known use of the phrase online was posted on page 197 of the "Cliff Yablonski Hates These People" photo gallery on the Internet humor site Something Awful.[9] In the gallery, a photo of a boy in a green shirt is shown crouching over another boy with the caption "What has science done?!! Don't answer that you inbred horselovers" (shown below).  While the exact origin of the meme is unknown, the earliest known usage of the phrase" Tits or GTFO" appeared on the 4chan [1] imageboard /b/ on December 11th, 2006. In a thread entitled Zooey-Chan?, in which an anonymous user claimed to be the woman in a picture, another user responded with numerous instances of the phrase "Tits or GTFO" (shown below).        On April 6th, 2009, David Horvitz[2], a New York-based artist known for his often eccentric DIY instructional projects[3], posted a picture with his head in the freezer titled "241543903" via his Flickr account SanPedroGlueSticks[4] (shown left). Days later on April 10th, the same numeric sequence "241543903" appeared in a Tumblr post which provided the following instruction for readers (shown right): Later in an interview with Urlesque[5] in December 2010, Horvitz explained that he conceived the idea after suggesting his sick friend Mylinh to try sticking her head in a freezer. The number "241543903" stems from a combination of the serial number of his refrigerator and the barcodes on a bag of edamame and a package of frozen soba noodles that were stored in the freezer. :3 can be seen as a horizontal variant of (‘ω’), a well-known Japanese emoticon representing a cat’s face that first became popular through its frequently usage on Japanese text and image board sites, most notably on 2channel, as well as other online communities since the early 2000s.    "Marisa Stole The Precious Thing" was originally composed by the Japanese Doujin group IOSYS[1], incorporating "Doll Judgement – The Girl Who Played with People's Shapes" from the seventh Touhou title Perfect Cherry Blossom[2] released at the 64th Comiket on August 17th, 2003. The original track itself was a slight remix of Alice's theme "Romantic Children" from the fifth Touhou title Mystic Square.[3] IOSYS' vocal remix was originally featured in the video game music (VGM) remix album Touhou Otome Bayashi (Touhou Maidens' Orchestra), which was released at the popular comic book convention Comiket on August 13th, 2006. Sung from the viewpoint of Touhou character Alice Margatroid, the song describes her mixed romantic feelings towards Touhou protagonist Marisa Kirisame, supporting her fanmade tsundere status. On August 10th, 2006, IOSYS launched a special page[4] for the fan-made Touhou album with a promotional animated music video for the song, which was later made into a movie and uploaded to YouTube.[5] This well-made animation quickly spread through the Japanese Otaku circles.  On September 29th, 2009, Weebl's Stuff released the animated video on YouTube, where it gathered upwards of 8.7 million views and 8,100 comments over the next eight years. Look at my horse My horse is amazing Give it a lick, "Ooo, it tastes just like raisins!" Have a stroke of its mane It turns into a plane, And then it turns back again When you tug on its winkie! "Ooo, that's dirty!" Do you think so? Well, I better not show you Where the lemonade is made! Sweet lemonade, mmmm, sweet lemonade Sweet lemonade, Yeah, sweet lemonade Get on my horse, I'll take you around the universe And all the other places too! I think you'll find that the universe, pretty much covers everything! Shut up woman, get on my horse!    The scene used in the videos originates from the Spongebob Squarepants episode "Naughty Nautical Neighbors". In the scene, Spongebob attempts to play a double bass, which he refers to as a bassinet, to impress Squidward. Spongebob then proceeds to incorrectly play the instrument, resulting in it falling apart. YouTube user SupDawg444 later created a video mixing the scene with U. N. Owen Was Her on August 9th, 2009. The video has since gained over 150 thousand views in under 7 years. This song was written by Jun Ishikawa, the main composer of Kirby series, for Kirby Super Star and later featured in a second game in the series, Kirby Super Star Ultra as well as in the Super Smash Bros. series. One of the earliest mashups[2] paired the Gourmet Race theme with rapper Snoop Dogg’s 2004 hit rap single "“Drop It Like it’s Hot," which was uploaded by YTMND user Barf on September 24th, 2006. Another YTMND site[3] with a more intricate graphic was created by the same author on October 11th, 2006. A month later, the second version was re-uploaded to YouTube, where it earned more than 2.7 million views in just under six years. This instance also went on to inspire a series of YTPMV remixes combining video game footage and rap songs by Snoop Dogg.  In July 2006, during the well-known annual E3, a first trailer from the Portal game was released: Then, according to a ED talk from 2007 about Portal, where they discussed the presence of the This is sparta meme inside the game, a user named Anonylol stated the following: There doesn't seem to be any 4chan archive from that exact period. However, Google insights, as well as the existence of many "Get the Cake!" 4chanarchives' threads way before the game's release, in october 2007, plus this link they talked about, tend to agree with that statement. "Get the cake", initially called "Delicious cake game" were threads that started on 4chan /b/ and were represented like this: The only request was to solve that puzzle without breaking the rules given by the first poster. This mix between Portal and an equivalent game using only mspaint tool caught on immediately there and a great amount of threads on /b/ as well as the /v/ board ensued: - Here is the earliest 4chanarchive version, dating from January 2007, that can be found: (WARNING : 4chanarchive got NSFW explicit content : Don't click this link if you're under the age of 18/21 depending on your county/country's laws) There are more archives about it but, due to the NSFW content, they won't show up here anymore. The fact it featured EFG on that version is an indication that older versions must have existed before that. - Following the game's release, so in october 2007, which gave new strength to that meme, a somewhat accurate Urban Dictionary entry mentionning it was created. According to the police report, the balloon reportedly took off at approximately 11:01 a.m. (Mountain Time) from the backyard of the Heenes' residence near Fort Collins, Colorado on October 15th, 2009. According to the news, Falcon's father Richard Heene first suspected that their son was missing after Falcon's brother told him that he had seen the six year old climb into the basket of the balloon shortly before its launch. The family's home movie footage of the balloon's takeoff was uploaded via YouTube on the following day, which shows the Heenes counting down in unison before releasing the tethered cord, followed by a frantic scene of screaming in panic as they realize Falcon may be onboard. In the following hour, the Heenes called the Federal Aviation Administration to report the missing balloon, as well as local news stations and the 911 emergency service to ask for help in tracking its flight and rescuing the boy. Upon receiving the call, an ABC-affiliate local news station[1] dispatched a helicopter to track the path of the drifting balloon, the footage of which was broadcast live on national television and released via YouTube (shown below). In the video, the balloon can be seen landing on the ground at the 5:40 mark: Technology-Ninja (AKA schrankmonster), an Xbox-related media blogging site, uploaded an Xbox 360 achievement generator on their site on January of 2007. Sites like Technabob and DigitalBattle started noticing this, spreading the knowledge of the existence of this generator on the internet. Fake achievements appearing on the Xbox 360 can simply be explained by hacking.  The series was started by the video with the title "GentleMentleMen" created by YouTube user Maplemaniac. The video was first uploaded to YouTube around September 2009, but the user's account was soon suspended. The video was reuploaded on October 10th, 2009[2] after the creator came back with a new account.[3] The video has gained over 500,000 views, however the creator chose to audioswap the original video. The original video has since been reuploaded with the original audio. This ending movie was for the first season of the TV anime series which was aired from October 2007 to December, 2007. The song used in the movie is "Hanamaru Sensation" (ハナマル☆センセイション) by a J-pop band Little Non.[2] The video that led to a substantial increase in popularity of the series was uploaded to NND on October 26th, 2007[3], which featured characters from a murder-mystery video game Higurashi When They Cry[4] by hand drawn animation.  According to the Lurkmore wiki the meme originated from the 4chan's /k/ board, a board about weaponry, around the late October 2008. The board began to be invaded by what they called "zombie threads" in which they were asked to give pieces of advice about the best weaponry choice and plan when facing a zombie outbreak. It was usually resulting in a division between those who wrote the most accurate response they could find and those who didn't believe in zombies, leading to fiery arguments between the two. Unfortunately, none of these threads were archived. Then, In october the 24th 2008, a new zombie thread took a new turn by adding an image macro titled "Zombie Tools" : However, on that first attempt, no one reused the picture as a response. The 29th of October 2008, the meme went to /b/ where another zombie thread popped up. There, the picture began to be reused to fulfill the requests. It then came back to the /k/ board, having more and more threads created. Instantly, the meme expanded to other boards and other chans, mainly those that got a zombie board. That kind of zombie threads, since then, are always present on a regular basis on 4chan as well as other boards. YTMND user onemoresolo featured the audio from a clip in the 1990 low-budget horror film Troll 2 in a page titled "Oh My GAHHHHHHHHD!" on February 28th, 2006, in which the character Arnold (played by Darren Ewing) witnesses several monsters consuming a woman and yells: “They’re eating her! And then they’re going to eat me too! Oh my god!” On September 8th, 2006, YouTuber Veovisjohn uploaded a clip of the scene, which received over 3.5 million views and 10,400 comments within six years. On September 17th, 2009, Redditor CtrlAltDelYourFace submitted a post titled “Hey Reddit, I heard you like bears and sharks, so I made you a Bear Shark. Enjoy," which featured a photoshopped image of a bear-shark hybrid monster. Prior to being archived, the thread received over 1,850 up votes and 275 comments, many of them containing more altered versions of the image. Redditor mintyice submitted a three bear moon version of the image (shown below, middle) and CtrlAltDelYourFace submitted an updated version of the image with octopus tentacles for arms (shown below, right). The original exploitable image stems from the second chapter of My Wild & Raunchy Son[1], an incest-themed gay erotica comic illustrated by artist Josman and published online in 2004.[2] In the comic, which entails a taboo relationship between a man and his son, the two characters get into a heated verbal argument, during which the son punches his father in the face, shortly before they make passionate love in reconciliation (shown below). The details regarding the first appearance of the comic on 4chan and its usage as an exploitable image remain murky at large; however, it is believed to have made its way onto the /b/ (random) board sometime in October 2005, during which many users created and shared a slew of photoshopped parodies bearing custom captions. Among them were an exceptionally nonsensical version captioned with puzzling expressions like "habeeb it" and "twinkie house," which quickly became known as the most notable instance in the series (shown below).   In House, which ran from 2004-2012,[2] the titular doctor's team usually encounters cases where they must figure out what is wrong with a patient.[1] Several times a patient displayed symptoms consistent with lupus, leading one of House's younger staff members to suggest that could be the reason the patient is ill. House usually counters the doctor with some variation of "It's not lupus." On April 9th, 2010, YouTube account Camilladilla posted a compilation of times the cast suggested diagnosing a patient with lupus, which House resists.   Street Fighter 4 is the fourth main edition to Capcom's Street Fighter franchise. It was released on February 17, 2009 in North America, almost ten years after the release of Street Fighter III: Third Strike. The Street Fighter series in general is considered a staple of fighting games and Street Fighter 4 is no exception. When the game came out, there was an abnormally large amount of low skilled players who picked the character Ken Masters. It got to the point where a thread was posted on Shoryuken.com called "Ken Fighter IV".[1] For a long time during the duration of Street Fighter 4, this joke was commonly used. It was even alluded to in IGN's Grudge Match: Blazblue vs. Street Fighter IV. The oldest mention of Flowchart Ken is from the Youtube video Fun with Street Fighter IV Random Online Matches PS3 which was posted on February 20, 2009 by JimmyLy. The image became more popular when it was reposted on both Gamefaqs.com and Shoryuken.com a few days later. Line Rider is an internet physics toy. Versions are available for Microsoft Silverlight and for Flash. It was originally created in September 2006 by Boštjan Čadež (also known as fšk), a Slovenian university student. Originally appearing on DevianArt on September 23, 2006, Line Rider quickly became an internet phenomenon. (Source: wikipedia. See link) The origin of the popular catchphrase is in the first part of the skit Charlie Murphy's True Hollywood Stories co-written by Charlie Murphy and Dave Chappelle for Dave Chappelle's Show called Chappelle's Show. Dave Chappelle, portraying as Rick James in the sketch part, said this in the beginning. (Go to 1:11 in the video down below)   In Act V Scene II of the play The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark by William Shakespeare, written between 1599 and 1602, the character Horatio says "Goodnight, sweet prince" to his dying friend Hamlet. In the 1998 American comedy film The Big Lebowski, the character Walter (played by John Goodman) says "goodnight sweet prince" before dumping the ashes of his deceased friend Donny (played by Steve Buscemi). On February 28th, 2006, YTMND[4] user Dashren2001 submitted a page titled "Goodnight Sweet Prince", which featured a Calvin and Hobbes comic strip in which a medicated Calvin ignores his stuffed animal friend to focus on school work with the song "Only Time" by Enya playing in the background (shown below). The earliest example of Automatic Mario on YouTube can be traced back to 2007 with a video titled "Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2 March of the Minis! Custom-made Stage: Automatic Mini Mario (マリオVSドンキーコング２　ミニミニ大行進！　自作ステージ: じどうミニマリオ) and uploaded by YouTuber sonomamario[3]. The video shows Mini-Mario, a toy version of Mario featured in "Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2" moving across the stage and completing the level with the aid of various tools and barriers alone. The video has been since removed by the uploader. In 2006, online popularity of Mario Paint songs saw its first leap when a team of Japanese developers released a freeware called Mario Sequencer (shown left, below), the first desktop version of Mario Music Composer. Eclipsing with the rise of video-sharing communities, the software and its musical compositions became a hit on Japanese memetic hubs like Nico Nico Douga. The earliest NND video of Mario Paint song was uploaded in April 2007, which was a 23-second composition of "The Wind's Yearning" originally featured in the video game Chrono Trigger. In 2007, an online flash game site called UnFun Games released Mario Paint Composer (shown right, above), yet another downloadable version of the original tool. Seen by many as an opportunity to relive their early 90s childhood, people downloaded the program and began making Mario Paint renditions of popular tunes found in videogames, animes, television shows and etc. The earliest YouTube rendtion was uploaded in June 2007, which featured the "Ruby Stage" theme from the videogame Panel de Pon.     As a picture, the first instance of a Blue Guy VS Red Guy was created by DeviantART user miniamericanflags on February 11th 2007 as way to share criticisms over the Socialism system as a way of life[1]. The earliest appearance of the meme on the internet was on the popular imageboard site, 4chan, on September 13, 2009[2]. Although, it might have appeared earlier seeing as the original thread was 404'd.     On July 2nd, 2006, artist K.C. Green published a webcomic in his titled “Tree. You’ve Been Good to Us" as part of the Horribleville[1] series, which featured an artist who illustrates the Dick Butt character after being scolded for wasting tree resources as a child (shown below).    The original newspaper advertisement seeking a partner for time traveling was written by John Silveira and published as filler in the September/October 1997 issue of Backwoods Home Magazine.[25] After his publisher, Dave Duffy, asked him for something to help fill up the classifieds page, Silveira wrote up a personal ad seeking a girlfriend and the time travel ad as a joke, using the same P.O. box numbers for both ads. As of October 2010, he had received thousands of responses to the time travel one and only five for his personal ad. Online, the ad gained notoriety after the first "Safety Not Guaranteed"[1] YTMND site was created by axlbonbach on October 27th, 2005. As of May 2013, it has more than 1.3 million views. The background music is Paul Engemann's "Push It To The Limit" [2] from the 1983 movie Scarface. It was featured in Volume 8 of the YTMND Soundtrack.  Launched by TogetherBe in 2006, the Peekaru[1], a fleece vest with a hole for a baby's head, was designed to fit comfortably over a variety of different front-facing baby carriers.[2] In late March 2009, the product was reported on several news sites and blogs including New York Magazine[3], Gizmodo[6] and Urlesque,[4] comparing Peekaru to another wearable fleece product Snuggie. Within days, forum members of the now-defunct t-shirt community Emptees[5] began posting photoshopped images of the catalog ad in a thread titled "Snuggie Baby." Like many other taunts said in Super Smash Bros Brawl, "You're Too Slow!" is a line that was specifically written for the game. However, like Ike Quotes, this is not necessarily out of character for Sonic is known for faulting his ability to run at high speeds. The first time Sonic has been shown running in the figure 8 fashion was in his Super Peel Out move in Sonic CD, where he will instantly accelerate to beyond his normal max speed after charging the move up. After the release of Super Smash Bros Brawl in the United States videos online started circulating showing off many of the characters taunts, a special animation that can be performed at any time to provoke opponents or as a short victory quote. In Brawl the Super Peel Out is not performed in combat, only being used as a motion for the "You're Too Slow!" taunt. The move gained infamy due to it being irritating to many people and it's spamability in both game and in message boards.   The earliest YouTube video created for the song features a clip art slideshow corresponding with the song's lyrics and was uploaded by YouTuber Sameer Zelaya[1] on August 19th, 2006. As of July 2014, the video has gained over 5.4 million views. The "Carol Never Wore Her Safety Goggles. Now She Doesn't Need Them" safety poster is one of several science and safety-related posters published by Flinn Scientific, Inc. an educational science supply company and manufacturer. The poster was introduced in the 2003 Flinn Scientific Catalog/Reference Manual and distributed free to science teachers who placed an order for laboratory chemicals with Flinn Scientific. The poster in itself provided appeal in the fact that, while meant to be an obvious warning sign for chemistry students, the delivered message about the blindness risks by chemicals seemed somewhat offbeat and over-melodramatic. On September 24th 2009, several months after her "I gotta ferret" video was posted to 4chan. It was originally uploaded to YouTube several months prior by Tabby's original account "TabithaRidiman". The video showed random clips of a 15 year old Tabby talking about her ferret, singing along to Gunther's Ooh, You Touch My Tra La La, and putting things up her nose. The original Peanut Butter Jelly Time flash animation was created by Ryan Gancenia Etrata and Kevin Flynn under the screen names RalphWiggum and Comrade Flynn, who posted it to the Offtopic[1] forums in early 2002. On March 21st, 2002, a Newgrounds[2] user YrebWarts posted Etrata and Flynn's work on the popular Flash gallery site, where the clip became wildly popular spawning a number of remakes.[3] Halflife: Full Life Consequences was originally submitted to the fanfic community Fanfiction.net by user squirrelking on May 18th, 2006. Apart from Full-Life Consequences, Squirrelking[2] has written numerous other fanfictions like Metal Gear Solid: Fight of Metal Gears, Halo: Halos in Space, and Final Fantasy VII: Story of Rain Strife. A self-claimed ESL (English-as-second-language) speaker, Squirrelking's works have been characterized by their abundance of grammatical and spelling errors. On the same day Half-Life: Full Life Consequences[1] was submitted to Fanfiction.net, YTMND user blind51de posted a dramatic reading of the original text.[3] The site featuring a screenshot of the manuscript and a narration was well-received by the community, generating more than 130,000 views as of May 2012.  The practice of "saging" originated on 2channel, the Japanese text board which inspired 4chan. The word "Sage" is a derivative of the Japanese verb "Sageru" (下げる), which means "to lower." The first indication of the practice of "saging" being used on 4chan is the flash video "Sage Man" created by animator Brian "Okk" Raddatz sometime before January 21st, 2006 (still image shown below).[1][2] On 2channel, Futaba Channel and, at that time, 4chan, typing the word "sage" into the email field when posting a reply would prevent the thread from moving up to the top of the board ("bumped").  The exploitable version above was extracted from this ad produced by The Visking Corporation, first published in the September 1942 edition of Woman's Day magazine. The character originates from the episode "Chocolate With Nuts", first aired on June 1st, 2002. In the episode Spongebob and Patrick attempt to sell chocolate to him, which he replies with "Did you say chocolate?". He then then begins screaming "CHOCOLATE" repeatedly. He reappears later in the episode, where he buys all of Spongebob and Patrick's chocolate. Later, on June 22, 2005, YTMND user "hehelololol" created a page[3] featuring the Tom Smith combined with the Metal Gear Codec, titled "Metal Gear Chocolate."   On September 9th, 2002, a round-up of work-safe porn images titled "Make Porn Work-Safe"[1] appeared in the "Comedy Goldmine" section on the website Something Awful. President Obama was photographed swinging a toy Star Wars lightsaber around during an announcement of Chicago’s bid for the 2016 Olympic Games. The original Getty Images photograph went viral via the Huffington Post, then followed to other viral media outlets and internet aggregating sites. Photoshops followed. In May 2006, Dutch journalist Koos Plegt[2] set up a blog[7] to showcase photos of cats with black fur under their noses, resembling Adolf Hitler's famous moustache[6] after seeing a cat with this coat pattern in his hometown of Zwolle, Holland.[3] A month after the site's inception, Plegt was contacted by British web developer Paul Neve[4] about turning the blog into a collaborative website. Cats That Look Like Hitler[5] was launched on June 26th, 2006. Users can rate and comment on the cat photos as well as submit their own.    According to Urban Dictionary[1], The name “Speedycat” came from a typo that occurred in late 2005 in a 4chan IRC chat room nicknamed "speedychat" for its excessive volume of spams. After an anonymous user misspelled the name of the chatroom as "Speedycat," another user created a flash animation[3] of a yellow cat travelling through space and posted it to 4chan. The animation was paired with the Engrish song “Speedycat” by Y&Co from the 2004 Playstation 2 music video game Beatmania IIDX11: IIDXRED.[2] In the original flash animation, the viewer could click on the moon, which triggered Speedycat to accelerate at "Warp Speed" with flashing lights and the song to play twice as fast. In a 2007 summer report video by Los Angeles Fox affiliate KTTV Fox 11 on Anonymous and 4chan, stock footage of an exploding yellow van is used in order to illustrate Anonymous danger and warn people about their "domestic terrorism". The exploding van footage came from ITN Source, a provider of stock and archival footage to large news corporations such as FOX and Reuters. Asha Oberoi, content director of ITN Source, offers some enlightening insight into why FOX may have chosen to use the exploding van footage; in this excerpt from Realscreen.com "Declining advertising revenue on traditional mediums has meant that there's a real demand for cheaper television to be made so that broadcasters see a return on their investment," says Oberoi, who believes that commissioning editors are looking to the Internet to see what draws viewers and are taking their leads from what's working online. "And the kind of content that works online has been that quirky, 'exploding van'- type stuff," she says. (bold added for emphasis)  On June 9th, 2009, YouTube user muclemente posted the video "Pastor Pilão(Lariat)/Guile Theme" in response to a thread on Brazilian video game forum Outer Space. A thread on Outer Space's Vale Tudo ("Anything Goes" in Portugese) board featured a video of Father Marco Feliciano, a priest of the Universal Church, who became over-excited during his own sermon and began spinning by the stage. At the end of the clip, Father Feliciano can be heard shouting "Sai da frente Satanas!" (Get out of the way Satan!) The spinning lariat displayed by the priest bares a striking resemblance to a special move executed by the character Zangief from the Street Fighter video game series. In the version of the video muclemente posted, the footage is mixed with the theme song for the Street Fighter character Guile. While many comments on YouTube and Outer Space pointed out that the song being played and the character being portrayed do not match, the video game reference is still well established. Soon, his ecstatic mannerisms and shouting met with huge success among Brazilian netizens, accruing more than 400,000 views in the first week of debut. The crabcore pose was popularized by the Ohio metalcore band Attack Attack! who introduced the "crab-like" dance in their music video for the 2008 single "Stick Stickly." The pose can be seen at 1:16 in the following video: The characteristic pose can be traced back to extreme metal bands that would play vertically and separate their legs while headbanging for added effect. Metalcore and deathcore bands would later adopt the pose where it becomes associated during "breakdown" sequences; usually a slow tempo movement where the guitars' lowest string is played in repetition and the vocalist shouts or growls a short phrase. The origin of the meme has been a subject of dispute, though many credit the Brazilian gaming forum UOL Jogos' Vale Tudo[1] ("anything goes") board as the site of origin. Others have claimed that members of Vale Tudo simply take credit for creating it but the meme has existed prior on 4chan before being adapted into Portuguese language. The vertical panel layout is similar to other multi-pane memes like Gaijin 4 Koma and Kurt Cobain Reactions. Apple Incorporated, the multinational corporation, has used a variety of distinctive advertising campaigns to promote their iPod digital media player, the most famous being commercials and print advertising using silhouetted characters (usually dancing) in front of a single-colored bright background listening to music with an iPod. The first time they appeared was September of 2003 in the form of posters, as stated by Chaosmint.com. Videos first appeared around October of 2003 but the first video to become popular using this idea was accompanied by the Black Eyed Peas song, Hey Mama, and debuted November of 2003: The last Apple commercial in this format aired on May 2008 featuring Coldplay's Viva La Vida. It is obvious, at this point, that the commercial has undergone a number of stylistic changes:   The original comic was drawn in 2005 by artist Mark Stivers[1] and featured via his blog on November 3rd.[2] The original instance featured the male character ecstatically yelling "Oh Buddha!" during sex and the follow-up instance posted four days later depicted the same character as an atheist yelling "Scientific Method!" The earliest archived thread featuring the exploitable on 4chan’s /b/ (random) board took place on December 7th, 2006.[3] Born in 2006, Nora was rescued from a shelter in Cherry Hill, New Jersey by piano teacher Betsy Alexander and named after the artist Leonora Carrington. According to Alexander, Nora began showing an unusual interest in music by sitting on the piano bench and tapping on the keys as early as when she was a year old. Since then, Nora has played the piano on a daily basis, occasionally performing duets with her owner and her owner's students. On January 28th, 2007, Alexander took the suggestions from her suggestions and uploaded a homemade video of Nora onto YouTube. The video was met by sensational responses, generating over 22 million views in the span of five years. Months later, she posted a sequel video. The concept of "rainbow vomit" stems from a blog article on I-mockery[1] about visiting Little Tokyo neighborhood in LA, posted by the site owner RoG on August 6th, 2006. In reviewing the Japanese supermarket, RoG commented on the colorful packaging's of Japanese snacks found in the store: Hmm, a rainbow throwing up a rainbow of colors. I don't know why, but I like that idea. Tell ya what. To any of you who draw me picture of a rainbow throwing up a rainbow of colors: I will post your pictures here in the blog. Do we have a deal? Alright then, get to work on those nauseated rainbows and email your pics to me! Within days, readers responded to the challenge with their own interpreations of "puking rainbows," opening up the floodgate of lulz.  The phrase has existed long before the internet, and was never associated with image macros in the first place. According to Urban Dictionary, the term bitch please originates from "amongst inner-city prostitution rings," in the 70s. And while it is used as a tongue-in-cheek reply nowadays, it carried a connotation of violence and hostility back in the day[1]. The nickname "Blue Screen of Death" first originated in 1987 during the OS/2 pre-release development activities at Lattice Inc., the makers of an early Windows and OS/2 C compiler. During porting of Lattice's other tools, developers encountered the error message when NULL pointers were dereferenced either in application code or when unexpectedly passed into system API calls. Upon its discovery, the developers coined the term Blue Screen of Death to describe the terminal nature of its experience. According to the Wikipedia[5] entry for “First Post”, the first English-language website where the commenting practice became a noticeable issue was the technology news site Slashdot,[1] which launched in September 1997. On the site, the first comment would be displayed above the rest in chronological order, often resulting in users replying with “First post!” or “FP!”   On September 13th, 2009, the 25th annual MTV Video Music Awards[1] ceremony was broadcast live at the Radio City Music Hall (video below). When country singer Taylor Swift won the Best Female Video award for her song "You Belong With Me,"[2] Kanye West came up on stage and took the mic from her to proclaim "Yo Taylor, I'm really happy for you, Imma let you finish but Beyonce had one of the best videos of all time…one of the best videos of all time!" before being booed off the stage. He handed the mic back to Swift but MTV cut to commercial before she could continue. West was reportedly asked to leave the venue[5] immediately after the incident. Later that evening, West wrote an apologetic blog post in all caps on his official website but the post was deleted within hours. Later in the evening, Beyonce won the Video of the Year award for "Single Ladies" (Put a Ring on It)[3] and instead of giving her own acceptance speech, she invited Taylor onstage to finish hers.[4] In March of 2007 former child star turned born-again fundamentalist Christian Creationist Kirk Cameron went on ABC's Nightline to refute the theory of evolution using a rather unique hypothesis: Because there is no Crocoduck, God exists. After having his theory discredited, Cameron appeared on Bill O'Rielly's show to prove that since there is no cross between a duck and a crocodile, evolution must not exist. On May 11th, the subject reached Metafilter. On May 13th 2007, Urbandictionary user Naton created the first definition. "One of the most prominent icons of modern day Christianity, the Crocoduck is capable of dispelling all arguments in favour of Atheism and Darwinism simply by not existing. Its sworn enemy is the platypus, which, in harsh contrast, is capable of proving god does not exist by existing." The comedy troupe Picnicface[1] uploaded a commercial for Powerthirst on May 28th, 2007. In the four and a half years since it was uploaded, the video has been viewed on YouTube over 24 million times. Narrated by comedian Mark Little, the video goes into hyperbolic detail about how the drink will make you "uncomfortably energetic," allowing you to do such things as vomit a wedding and have 400 babies.      The website CryingWhileEating.com[2] was created by filmmaker Casimir Nozkowski and writer Daniel Engber as their submission entry for the Contagious Media Showdown, a viral media competition hosted by Jonah Peretti in May 2005 to see who could draw the most web traffic within a week. The site was launched with a batch of 12 videos starring Nozkowski, Engber and their friends on May 19th, 2005, with each entry accompanied by a descriptive summary of uploader's first name, choice of food and reason for crying: On January 22nd, 2005, Atom.Smasher[3] Error message generator was launched, which allows users to chose common error icons and add their own humorous messages. Two days later the site launched a gallery[4] of user created error messages. The identities of the girl in the photo and the photographer still remain unknown, but the original image first appeared online via imageboard community 4chan[1] in a /b/ (random) thread posted on August 22nd, 2009. On 4chan, images containing an exploitable cutout of the girl have been also referred to as "Bubbles Girl" or simply "Chubbles." Somewhat similar to the use of Disaster Girl and Strutting Leo, Chubby Bubbles Girl is usually photoshopped into scenes of disasters or chase-and-run scenarios. On June 6th, 2004, DeviantArt [1] Bioviral posted a drawing of Pikachu to their page (shown below). In 2008, a 4chan anon posted the image to /b/, where users began using the image as an exploitable and adding faces to Pikachu. Though the link to the original thread appears dead,[7] KnowYourMeme user Dragod claims to have originally posted the picture. Buzzkilling in the form of image macros made its earliest known appearance on May 20th, 2004 in a Something Awful photoshop contest[4] based on an United States Postal Service safety notice titled "Put Yourself in My Shoes," which encouraged homeowners to keep their dogs under control during mail deliveries. Later that day, a forum member remixed the flyer[5] in the most literal sense with captions directly addressing the dog from the mailman's perspective ("Those are my shoes. Give them back, you are a dog. They don’t even fit."). The source image that the edited images are based on is a safety notice issued by the US Postal Service, pictured below: On May 20th, 2004, a Something Awful goon named Djarum posted the following message: So yesterday I walk downstairs to get my mail, along with the tons of free magazines and bills I get this. Since when has the Postal Serivce been sending out such great little safety notices? Well of course the first thing that I thought of was to post it on here for everyone to partake in the fun. I start it when my first horrible attempt. Hopefully someone can do justice to it. UPDATE eaglebtc was kind enough to help everyone out with the whole process. Here's what he told me: quote: Hope it helps! In the next ten pages, hundreds of derivatives were created. It soon became a contest. Results were archived on May 24th and May 31st, 2004.  The concept of character alignment as it is typically viewed comes from the game Dungeons and Dragons released on 1974,[9] wherein players were able to create their very own characters, customizing a variety of different aspects. One of these aspects is the alignment of the character, which basically indicated whether your character was good or evil and whether he followed the law or not. The system begun operating on two axis by the 1977 release of Dungeons and Dragons[1], one consisting of "Lawful", "Neutral", and "Chaotic", and the other of "Good", "Neutral", and "Evil"; you would combine one of the traits of the first axis with one of the traits of the other, thus resulting in alignments such as "Lawful Good" or "Chaotic Evil", with nine possible alignments in total. The original video, entitled "Fast Food Freestyle", was first posted by Joe Woody sometime in the Spring of 2006. The video was later taken down for unknown reasons, but it was reuploaded by Woody on July 4th, 2007, gaining 800 thousand views. In 1951, the Wilhelm scream was first used as a sound effect in the Florida western film Distant Drums, in which a soldier lets out a loud cry while being dragged underwater by an alligator (shown below, left). In 1953, the scream was used in the film The Charge at Feather River, featuring the character Private Wilhelm who lets out the scream when he is struck by an arrow (shown below, right). In the 1970s, sound designer Ben Burtt nicknamed the sound "Wilhelm scream" when he noticed the effect was used in numerous films. The scream was most likely voiced by actor Sheb Wooley,[4] who Burtt discovered on a Warner Brothers call sheet for Distant Drums.[3] At 10:59pm on July 16th, 2009, the message was posted on a World of Warcraft forum[1] operated by Baidu, China’s largest search engine. The first responses came within minutes from random members viewing the forum: "I’m not coming back home for dinner today. I’m eating at the internet café. Tell my mother for me, will you?" and "If you don’t come back home right now I’ll make you kneel on the washboard." The thread soon gave rise to an unprecedented flash flood of public creativity, resulting in over 300,000 responses within the first 48 hours. The still-shots of Kurt Cobain playing the guitar on stage were taken from the video footage of Nirvana's 1993 MTV Unplugged in New York[1] session, specifically during the band's cover performance of "Where Did You Sleep Last Night" (shown below). Recorded and taped at Sony Studios in New York City on November 18th, 1993, Nirvana's MTV Unplugged session was aired on December 14th, 1993, followed by the release of the live album on November 1st, 1994, only months after Cobain was found dead at his home in April that year. The video footage of the performance was eventually released on DVD on November 20th, 2007. <center A few months prior to the DVD release, the earliest known multi-pane instance featuring Cobain's face was posted on Steven Walley's 4chan image blog[2] on August 20th, 2007. On November 9th, 2007, a four-pane image macro illustrating a humorous exchange between Cobain and a bear in a swimming pool was featured on SplatterBlog[5], followed by Idolator's repost[6] of the same image a few days later on the 13th. The word "Lurker" is used to describe someone who reads a message board or forum, often regularly, but rarely posts or contributes in any way. It is believed to have originated in the mid 1980's on BBS systems of the time.[1] According to a 2006 study by Catherine Ridings (Lehigh University), David Gefen (Drexel University), and Bay Arinze (Drexel University) entitled "Psychological Barriers: Lurker and Poster Motivation and Behavior in Online Communities"[2] people may "lurk" due to a lack of trust for members of the community; however, in many social communities such as Anonymous boards like 4Chan, the idea of trust is hardly a common value. To help users cope with controversial content such as trolling, 4chan advises users to "lurk" before posting. When one fails to meet this requirement, they would often find their remarks and opinions met with the command, "Lurk Moar, newfag." It is unknown who first used the term "lurk moar." "Lurk Moar" is rule number 33 of The Rules of The Internet, which were written to include "Rule 33" from the very first drafts in 2006 (shown below). "Moar" is lolspeak for "more" and is a portmanteau of the words "More" and "Roar,"[3] spelled that way to heighten the level of enthusiasm as opposed to "more." An increase in "Moar" Google queries is congruent with the peak of Caturday's popularity in the Spring of 2007.[4] This may explain the increase in searches for "lurk moar" at the end of 2006, which is congruent with the start of Caturday and thus hosted the frequent posting of lolcats and lolspeak. Nicholas Gurewitch uploaded "Box of Hate" on July 4th, 2007 (shown below).[1] Though PBF comics are undated, reverse image search engine TinEye[2] first crawled the image on February 7th, 2008. The comic grew into a popular exploitable shortly after being posted. A thread in which people posted various examples was posted to Newgrounds [3] on January 18th, 2008, though all the images in that thread have been lost (template shown below).  The original scene takes place during the final sequence of Star Wars Episode 3, released on May 19th, 2005, when Darth Vader awakens in the aftermath of a fight with fellow Jedi, Obi-Wan Kenobi. He is then informed by Sith Lord Darth Sidious about the consequences of his rage when he inadvertently killed Padme (seen below). On May 20th, 2005, the YTMND user Redily[7] created the YTMND "NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!"[8] which depicted a still from the newly released Episode III, along with the sound byte of Darth Vader saying the phrase "Nooooo!" Since then, the site has accumulated over one million views and been inducted into the YTMND Hall of Fame. The earliest known upload specifically referencing the scene on YouTube was added on September 17th, 2006, by YouTuber[9] Robotchicken09 under the title "darth vader says NOOOOOOO" (shown below). The video received nearly 2.8 million views, 20,000 likes and 5,500 comments in roughly 14 and a half years.  The first round of Bush-Kerry Presidential debate was held at the University of Miami on the evening of September 30th, 2004. One of the more interesting questions prompted by the moderator Jim Lehrer was "Are Americans now dying in Iraq for a mistake?", referring to the declining public approval of US military operations in Iraq that began in March 2003. In answering the question, Senator John Kerry (D) essentially advocated the presence of US troops in Iraq, but also accused the incumbent president of failing to round up adequate international support and lacking necessary skills in diplomacy. On March 13th, 1998, Blizzard Entertainment released the video game Starcraft. In the game, there are three races: Terran, Zerg and Protoss. The Protoss are an advanced technological race of aliens. To play with this race, one must construct "pylons" to build bases and other instruments of combat. Pylons are one type of building that bound zones where you can construct. They provide energy to your buildings and increase the number of units you can own. When you try to create buildings or units without fulfilling the pylon request, an electronic voice (the one that helps you throughout the game) warns you by declaring: "You must construct additional pylons!" or "We need more pylons!"    The American television show "Cops" follows police officers during their daily patrols. On February 17th, 2007 an episode entitled "Tough Takedowns Special Edition", a man with dwarfism who had been previously arrested for solicting money. Officer Evan Rosenthal saw him waving down cars and wanted to see if he was asking for money. The man fled, climbed a pole, and performed a backflip. Eventually the man was put in handcuffs, resulting in the now famous line. The video on Milk and Cookies also shows the police officer trying to help the man find a job. On September 6 2004, Something Awful user Ryan "OMGWTFBBQ" Adams created a thread entitled Swap grandparents and babies heads! in the Comedy Goldmine sub-section of the website, following an idea by Something Awful's founder Lowtax exposed as the following : The thread, being basically a photoshop contest, garnered 14 pages of modified photographs displaying swappings between grandparents' and grandchildren's heads. In October of 2006, Youtube user Kajetokun uploaded the first Over 9000 video parodying the Dragon Ball Z anime series. The following month, Kajetokun created another DBZ video, "The Balls are Inert" from a particular scene involving Piccolo, the Namekian alien, and a story about balls… being inert. By checking on the video's Youtube page, one can see that the video has more than 1,500,000 views.   In 2004, Norwegian humor website Prikk.com[1] shared a photo titled "The main difference between Europe and USA," showing two seated women photographed from behind. Both women are shown wearing low-rise pants with thong underwear. The woman representing Europe is slender with good posture while the woman representing America is overweight and hunched over. In the bottom corner of each image, stereotypical food is presented, to show where the differences come from. Europe is represented by a basket full of wine while America is represented with a McDonald's burger, fries and soft drink.   On December 22nd, 2005, Cicierega[11] (a.k.a. Lemon Demon) and Vulliez[10] (a.k.a. altffour) submitted an animation titled "The Ultimate Showdown"[1] to the flash website Newgrounds. As of May 3rd, 2012, the original Newgrounds submission has received over 12,400,000 views and a rating of 4.35 stars. Old Godzilla was hoppin' around, Tokyo City like a big playground, When suddenly Batman burst from the shade, And hit Godzilla with a bat grenade, Godzilla got pissed and began to attack, But didn't expect to be blocked by Shaq, Who proceeded to open up a can of Shaq Fu, When Aaron Carter came out of the blue, And he started beating up Shaquille O'Neal, Then they both got flattened by the Batmobile, But before he could make it back to the Batcave, Abraham Lincoln popped out of his grave, And took an AK-47out from under his hat, And blew Batman away with a rat-a-tat-tat, But he ran out of bullets and he ran away, Because Optimus Prime came to save the day! This is the ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny! Good guys, bad guys and explosions, As far as the eye can see, And only one will survive, I wonder who it will be. This is the ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny. Godzilla took a bite out of Optimus Prime, Like Scruff McGruff took a bite out of crime, Then Shaq came back covered in a tire track, But Jackie Chan jumped out and landed on his back, And Batman was injured and trying to get steady, When Abraham Lincoln came back with a machete, But suddenly something caught his leg and he tripped, Indiana Jones took him out with his whip, Then he saw Godzilla sneaking up from behind, And he reached for his gun which he just couldn't find, Because Batman stole it, and he shot and he missed, And Jackie Chan deflected it with his fist, Then he jumped in the air and he did a somersault, While Abraham Lincoln tried to polevault, Onto Optimus Prime, but they collided in the air, Then they both got hit by a Care Bear Stare, This is the ultimate showdown, of ultimate destiny! Good guys, bad guys and explosions, As far as the eye can see, and only one will survive, I wonder who it will be, This is the ultimate showdown. Angels sang out, in immaculate chorus, Down from the heavens, Descended Chuck Norris, Who delivered a kick, Which could shatter bones, Into the crotch, Of Indiana Jones, Who fell over on the ground, Writhing in pain, As Batman changed back, Into Bruce Wayne, But Chuck saw through, His clever disguise, And he crushed Batman's head, In between his thighs. Then Gandalf the Grey, And Gandalf the White, The Monty Python and the Holy Grail's Black Knight, And Benilo Mussolini, And the Blue Meanie, And Cowboy Curtis, And Jambi the Genie, Robocop, The Terminator, Captain Kirk, And Darth Vader, Lo Pan, Superman, Every single Power Ranger, Bill S. Preston, And Theadore Logan, Spock, The Rock, Doc Ock, And Hulk Hogan. All came out of nowhere lightning fast, And they kicked Chuck Norris in his cowboy ass, It was the bloodiest battle that the world ever saw, With civilians looking on in total awe, The fight raged on for a century, Many lives were claimed but eventually, The champion stood, The rest saw the better, Mr. Rogers in a blood stained sweater, This is the ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny! Good guys, bad guys and explosions, As far as the eye can see, And only one will survive, I wonder who it will be, This is the ultimate showdown! (this is the ultimate showdown) This is the ultimate showdown! (this is the ultimate showdown) This is the ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny! The original scene used in the meme comes from the second Lord of the Rings film, The Two Towers, which was released in theaters on December 18th, 2002. During a scene where Legolas, Aragorn and Gimili are chasing down a pack of Uruk-hai that previously captured the hobbits Merry and Pippin in the first movie, Aragorn and Legolas climb a rock outcrop to scan the valley. At one point, Aragorn asks Legolas "what do your elf eyes see?" since elves in Middle-earth have better vision than other races, which is where the quote used in memes comes from (shown below). The actual origin of the image used in memes is uncertain, however, the oldest known instance of it appeared on October 14th, 2006, when Facepunch[1] forum member Zeldy created a thread titled "Legolas! What do your elf-eyes see?" The thread resulted in many new images made, spanned 11 pages over the course of about a year (examples shown below).[2] This three-panel format became the most widespread use of the scene early on. Although largely unsubstantiated, usage of RTFM may have begun as a military lingo during World War II, when the phrase "Read The Field Manual" became a staple expression among American soldiers in response to basic questions asked by new enlistees. First introduced in 1939, US Army Field Manuals instructed all the vital, necessary skills for a soldier, from how to fold your clothes properly to how to toss a grenade inside the enemy’s tank. The earliest confirmed instance of RTFM was printed in 1979 LINPACK Users’ Guide[1], the manual for using the LINPACK linear algebra software library written for Fortran programming language. In the table of contents section, the text appears as a quote attributed to Anonymous: The first Urban Dictionary[2] entry for RTFM was submitted on November 13th, 2003, although its usage has been documented in Slashdot comments as early as in March 1999. On February 7th, 2008, Valentina Hasan, a 29-year-old aspiring singer from the village of Zvezdelina in Bulgaria's Kardzhali Province, participated in an audition for the second season of Bulgarian singing competition TV show Music Idol. From the beginning, Hasan puzzles the panel of judges by stating that she is going to sing Mariah Carey's "Ken Lee," a misinterpretation of the song's chorus "Can't Live" and an erroneous title for the British band Badfinger's 1970 soft rock song "Without You" as famously covered by Mariah Carey. As she begins sing the lyrics of the song in broken English, or Engrish, the judges soon lose their composure upon realizing that she is singing her own unique interpretation of "Without You." Although Hasan didn't make the cut to advance to next round of competition, her audition clip was subsequently uploaded to YouTube[5] by user ArathBenedek, which quickly spread through Bulgarian internet forums and garnered more than four million views within the first month of its debut. As of mid-February 2016, the YouTube video has accrued over 16.3 million views. The phrase was originally spoken by The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air character Uncle Phil (played by James Avery) in Season 4, Episode 10 "Home is Where the Heart Attack Is," which originally aired on November 15th, 1993. In the episode, Uncle Phil suffers a heart attack, forcing him to abstain from consuming fatty foods. In the scene below, Uncle Phil laments his new dietary restrictions by listing several of his favorite foods that he can no longer consume: "I can't do this. I can’t give up my favorite foods cold turkey. Oh my god, turkey… with pillowy mounds of mashed potatoes… butter drenched dressing… tiny onions… swimming in a sea of cream sauce." The earliest known remix based on Uncle Phil's soundbite was submitted as a YTMND site titled "Uncle Phil is Fat" by user Mxyzptlk on May 27th, 2007. Featuring a tiled screen capture of Uncle Phil and an audio clip of the “pillowy mounds” monologue, the page has received over 15,800 views as of September 2012. According to the ytmnd wiki page, the first instance was created in 2005 by a user by the name of 'Chav Slayer" and was called "Obi Wan picks on goats". It has since been deleted but it gave rise to a number of derivatives from 2005-2007.    "Umineko no Naku Koro ni" is a visual novel series about mistery and murder, the plot takes place in the family reaunion of the Ushiromiya family of 1986 in the family island "Rokkenjima " where all the family and servants are killed in October 4 and 5; since there is a typhoon in the island, none can enter or escape the island. The protagonist is Battler Ushiromiya, son of Kinzo's second son Rudolf. Battler has not been to the annual Ushiromiya conference in six years due to living with his maternal grandparents ever since his mother Asumu died, and even took his mother's maiden name instead of Ushiromiya. When his grandparents died, he went back to living with his father, his second wife Kyrie, and their daughter Ange, his half-sister. Once on the island, Battler once again becomes acquainted with the legend of the golden witch Beatrice who supposedly lives in the naturally dense forest on Rokkenjima. A portrait of her lies in the entrance hall of the Ushiromiya family mansion, and a puzzling epitaph is written below the portrait. Rumor has it on the island that Beatrice gave ten tons of gold to Kinzo in the past to restart the Ushiromiya family after being crippled in the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake. It is said that whoever solves the riddle of the witch's epitaph will receive the gold and be the next successor to the Ushiromiya family. The "game" starts when the typhoon begins, starting with the murder of six people on the island. If the witch's epitaph cannot be solved, people will continue to die in mysterious deaths, following the outline given by the epitaph itself, until the witch Beatrice ultimately revives. After this comes to pass, Battler is the only one left alive who does not believe in witches or magic, and as such the door to the "golden land" (as stipulated on the epitaph) cannot be opened. Beatrice takes Battler and herself to a parallel dimension, Purgatorio( a meta-world), which is able to oversee events on Rokkenjima. The main topic of the game is to solve the riddles of the game and the "Epitaph of the Witch", Battler must attempt to explain all of the mysterious events on Rokkenjima from the standpoint that they are caused by a human, and Beatrice attempts to explain everything with witches and magic. One of the earliest archived mentions of Approval Guy appeared on 4chan’s /b/ (random) board in a thread titled "Conclusion to Wincest for Breakfast”[8] posted on September 7th, 2008. In one of the last comments to the thread, a user posted an unedited Approval Guy photo with the caption “Approval Guy approves of this story!” In an e-mail interview with Know Your Meme, the subject of the "Approval Guy" revealed that the photograph was taken by one his friends at a lingerie party in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in Spring 2008. Later that same year, the friend posted the photo to 4chan, where another anonymous user saved it and began reposting it. He also explained that the girls depicted in the picture were of age at the time and had given consent to take photographs. In September of 2004, the website tourettesguy.com was launched that featured Danny's videos. The website is now defunct, but has a new home at thetourettesguy.tv.[1]  The image of Guevara was taken by Cuban photographer Alberto Korda on March 5th, 1960, while attending a memorial service for victims of the La Coubre explosion in Havana, Cuba. According to historical accounts, Che briefly made a public appearance during the service, at which point Korda snapped just two frames of Che from a distance of about 25 to 30 feet before the guerrilla leader disappeared from sight. However, Korda's photo remained unpublished for seven years and he kept a cropped version of the original photo for his private collection. The photograph was then acquired by a wealthy Italian publisher and intellectual by the name of Giangiacomo Feltrinelli in 1967. Feltrinelli had just returned from Bolivia where he had hoped his fame would help in negotiating the release of French journalist and professor, Régis Debray. Debray was arrested because it was believed that he was in connection with guerrilla operations led by Che Guevara. As Guevara's eventual capture and/or death seemed to be imminent with the CIA closing in on his whereabouts, Feltrinelli acquired the rights to publish Che's captured Bolivian Diary. At this time, Feltrinelli asked Cuban officials where he could obtain portraits of Guevara. He was directed to Korda's studio where he presented a letter of introduction from the government. The document asked for Korda's assistance in finding a good portrait of Che. Korda immediately knew that his favorite image of Che was perfect and pointed to the 1960 shot of Che hanging on the wall, saying that the photo was the best of those he had taken of Che. Feltrinelli agreed and ordered 2 prints. When the rich Itallian returned the following day to acquire the copies, Korda told him that the man did not have to pay, for he was a friend of the Revolution. When Feltrinelli returned to Italy, he created thousands of copies of the poster to raise awareness of Che's precarious situation and impending demise. Later, in 1968, after Che was executed, Che's Bolivian Diary with Korda's photo on the cover was released worldwide. Feltrinelli also created posters to promote the book, which sold over 1 million copies. By this time, Korda's image had officially entered the public consciousness. Through Feltrinelli's actions, the picture had become famous. As a life-long communist and supporter of the Cuban revolution, Alberto Korda claimed no payment for his picture. Even though many parodies and imitations of the portrait were reproduced on a mass scale for decades, Korda never asked for anything in return. Korda reasoned that Che's image represented his revolutionary ideals, and thus the more his picture spread the greater the chance Che's ideals would spread as well. However, Korda did not want commercialization of the image in relation to products he believed Guevara would not support, especially alcohol. This belief was displayed for the first time in 2000, when Smirnoff used Che's picture in a vodka commercial. Korda sued Lowe Lintas and Rex Features, the company that supplied the photograph to the vodka distillery. Lintas and Rex retorted that the image was in the public domain. The final result was an out of court settlement for 50,000 U.S. dollars to be given to Korda, which the photographer, in turn, donated to the Cuban health care system. However, he was not against its propagation altogether, telling reporters:  I.M. Meen was released in North America in 1995. In the game, the player takes the role of a child who has been trapped in the labyrinth of the evil librarian I.M. Meen. The game was developed by Animation Magic, the same team behind the Legend of Zelda games for the Philips CD-i. [1]   On April 8th, 2008 veteran video mashup artists wreckandsalvage joined the Youtube Poop community and created the first "X with a layer added every second" YTP video; entitled Wreckrolled. While W&S have a healthy following on Vimeo, they were the newcomers to the YTP community and as such, they might not have been successful at triggering a fad if it hadn't been for the more experienced Pooper, Erarg. Aaron Valdez (1/3rd of W&S) explains: We joined the YTP community about a year ago just to see what it was about, learn more about what and why people remix. Posted this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUGah9lBAgA which was then mimicked by a more seasoned member, Erarg, who gave it a title “Hotel Mario with a layer added every second.” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZttcfCZ5aUQ This quickly became a fad within YTP because of his standing, a better title that describes how to make the video (our version syncs beats from the song which I guess work out to one second), and the fact that it was easily replicated. The fad even spawned another user to use this technique to create another version using “Never Gonna Give You Up” source footage without knowledge of our original. Despite this his version has more views because of his greater involvement within the community. Poopers, including the first user to mimic our video, Erarg, who know we created the first video have always given credit to us for being the source of the fad. But the I would credit the fad itself to Erarg https://www.youtube.com/user/Erarg for all of the reasons mentioned. Without him it would just exist quietly as most of our work does on YouTube. I found how the video spread all pretty interesting. Michel J. Fox is an Canadian–American actor and activist most well-known for his role as Marty McFly from the Back to the Future trilogy. In 1991, Fox was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, a condition marked by motor dysfunctional symptoms like shaking and slowness of movement. Since unofficially retiring form his acting career in 2000, Fox has been focusing his energy towards fundraising for the cure of Parkinson's disease. The first instance of Michael J. Fox's equation was posted by YTMND user thebroken on September 23rd, 2005. Titled "Michael J. Fox Gettin Jiggy,"[1] the site featured a headshot portrait of young Michael J. Fox wobbling from side to side set to Will Smith's 1998 rap single "Getting Jiggy Wit It." Chewiki credits Youtube Pooper Gallas as the originator of the fad, when he created his video "Hotel Mario in G Major" on November 24th, 2007. Gallers is also known for originating the "Electronic Sounds" fad, making him an influential Pooper. However, even though Gallers played an influential part in popularizing the fad, (popularity begets popularty) and was the first to use the phrase "In G Major" in his poops, this style was seen previously in the video "Scaryroll" created by PanicBomber on August 11th, 2007; over three months prior to Gallas' video. On May 12th, 2008, YouTuber OffbeatEarth posted a video to YouTube titled "Bill O'Reilly Flips Out," featuring leaked footage of O'Reilly yelling profanities at his co-workers while experiencing technical difficulties with his teleprompter. While the original video was removed, YouTuber CrownVictoriaCop reuploaded it the following day, gathering more than 2.6 million views and 3,400 comments over the next nine years (shown below). "We'll do it live!" Fuck it! Do it live! I'll write it and we'll do it live!"  Office Space was a 1999 comedy by Beavis and Butthead creator Mike Judge, about a group of employees who hate their jobs, and decide to rebel against their greedy boss. Milton Waddams (played by actor Stephen Root) is an eccentric character that has an emotional attachment to his stapler. The character Milton originally came from a short cartoon from the early 90s MTV show Liquid Television. The "Excuse-me, I believe you have my stapler ?" catchphrase was featured in a YTMND page in 2004. According to the YTMND wiki, it became one of the first big hits on the site. The season two finale of The OC, titled "The Dearly Beloved," first aired on May 19th, 2005. In the episode's final scene, Trey is fighting with Ryan (played by Ben McKenzie) as Marissa watches. When Trey begins to choke him, Marissa yells at him to stop. When he continues, she shoots him in the back, and when the gun goes off Imogen Heap's "Hide and Seek" begins to play. The song continues as long dramatic shots of Trey and Marissa's faces play. The scene was first uploaded to YouTube on November 15th, 2006, by YouTuber Daz90.[1] As of June 2014, the video has gained over 230,000 views.   Masaki Sumitani is part of the Japanese comedy duo known as Razor Ramon, a name which he also used in his brief wrestling career. Sumitani and his friend Makoto Izubuchi formed Razor Ramon in 1997. Sumitani's most well-known performing character is Hard Gay (ハードゲイ, Hādo Gei), also called "HG", Razor Ramon Hard Gay or Razor Ramon Sumitani, an eccentric supposedly gay man wearing tight black leather and PVC clothes and acting with overacted gay mannerisms. According to Wikipedia, Sumitani had been a popular stage comedian, performing a few different characters for a few years befor joining Yoshimoto Kogyo Co., Ltd. In 1999. Excerpt from Wikipedia on Yoshimoto Kogyo: Sumitani introduced the Hard Gay character (known in Japan as Hādo Gei) in 2002, growing to national renown by 2005 when Hard Gay became a weekly feature on the Bakushō Mondai no Bakuten!(Daibakuten) variety show. The character represents a common stereotype of American gay subculture to the Japanese audience and does not represent any Japanese gay subculture. Because of this, it was allowed to be aired and not deemed offensive to Japanese audiences. On the show, Hard Gay goes around performing acts of charity (or yonaoshi, “social improvement” → source: wikipedia link) for unsuspecting bystanders, wearing his fetish outfit while accompagnied by the Ricky Martin's "Livin’ la Vida Loca" song. He has also trademarked gesture and vocalizations such as his "pelvic thrust", his "Hoooooo" (フゥ～!) or "Foohhhh!" (フォー！) running jokes shouts or also his "Sei sei sei sei sei" shout with his palm in front of the person’s face. The main theme of Hard Gay's act relies on the idea that Hard Gay is a foreigner, and as such, can get away with outlandish behavior. The setting of each video On May 10th, 2005, Parry Gripp released the album For Those About to Shop, We Salute You in the United States. The album features the song "Do You Like Waffles?"[1] The following year, on March 23rd, 2006, Oglio, the record company that released the album, published a flash-animated music video for the song. The post received more than 6.1 million views as of April 2020 (shown below).  The cat's identity or its origin remain unclear, but the earliest mention of "Limecat" on record can be found in an Urban Dictionary entry[1] submitted by user Rodri316 on December 12th, 2003. The description furthermore suggests that the cat had become a well-known character on GameFAQ's LUE discussion forum prior to its submission. Limecat is the supreme ruler of all cats. His head has a natural beret which strongly resembles a cut-up lime, but is really a symbol of his power. Limecat is usually not pleased with the deeds and words of petty humans, and no one has ever claimed to catch him in a good mood. The helmet worn by the cat has been long presumed to be made of lime. However, it is most likely a carved pomelo[2] that is traditionally worn during the Mid-Autumn Festival in Chinese culture, suggesting that the photograph may have originated on the Chinese Internet. While the precise origin of "Surprise Buttsex" is unknown, the phrase can be interpreted as a humorous alternative to the more blatant "ass rape." [still researching] On January 20th, 2009, Barack Obama's presidential inaugural ceremony was held at the West Front of the United States Capitol building. After evangelical pastor Rick Warren delivered the ceremony's invocation, Aretha Franklin sang the American patriotic song "My Country, 'Tis of Thee" by Samuel Francis Smith (shown below). During the performance, Franklin wore a distinctive grey hat, which was adorned with a Swarovski crystal-studded bow. The hat was designed and constructed by milliner Luke Song from Detroit, Michigan. According to the Milliner, Aretha visited his Detroit showroom in early January of 2009 looking for a special hat for the inaguration. The fashion news publication WWD[2] quoted Song saying: “She’s our regular customer and comes to us often. She actually had three to choose from for that day, but went with her second choice. It probably looked better on camera.”  While the photographer is unknown, the original photo of the bird was seen on the Internet as early as 2004, when it was entered as part of a Photoshop contest on Worth1000.[1] In 2007, the same image was used to illustrate how to use filters on a Japanese OpenCV 1.0 reference site.[2] The picture of the parrot was also freely distributed during the 2000s as a wallpaper labeled “Amazon parrot.”[3] The bird has been identified as a Hyacinth Macaw[4], which is the largest macaw and the largest flying parrot species. They are native to central and eastern South America, where they are currently endangered due to habitat loss and trapping. On February 19th, 2007, YTMND user Keaton Monger, also known as keatonkeaton999[3], created a page titled "300TMND: THIS IS SPARTA (fun times mix)[1]" which features a looping gif of the This Is Sparta! scene in the movie with a remix song titled "300 This is Sparta[2]" playing. The page gathered more than 178.700 views with a 4.57 out of 5 star rating. The original image was taken by photographer Laney Griner of her then 11-month-old son Sammy on August 26th, 2007. She posted it to both her personal Flickr account[1] and put it up on Getty Images[6], which has since been removed.  The website Lawsforkids.org[1] was created in September 1997 by the Arizona Foundation for Legal Services and Education with the specific goal of "educating Arizona's youth, their parents, communities and schools to increase their knowledge about youth laws and to encourage law-abiding behavior." The site hosts a wide range of activities for the youths and children, such as video games[2], stories[3] and cartoons[4]. This one, shown below, is a cartoon strip titled "Driving Drunk"[5]: This one is called "Fighting"[6]: The first known instance of the phrase "Jesus Christ it's a lion get in the car" appeared in a Toothpaste for Dinner[1] webcomic titled "Basic Electronic Symbols" posted on August 30th, 2005.  The origin of the photo is currently unknown and largely undocumented. The earliest instance we have been able to backtrace so far is a YTMND created November 6th, 2005 by user AnimalChin. The odd part is that this YTMND only has 781 views and only 2.17 stars. The Origin of Broccoli Dog is currently being researched & evaluated! If you have any detailed information regarding its history and origin, please contact research staff via Email.   The term “butthurt” originates from spanking[1], the act of striking the buttocks of another person, which is often seen as a method of punishing a child. Though some cultures view this as an acceptable form of discipline, it can be interpreted as abusive corporal punishment. Online, one of the earliest archived mentions of “butthurt” appeared in a 1998 comment[8] posted on the website of Swiss surrealist painter H. R. Giger.[9] The comment was left by a poster named Doug in responding to Giger’s grievance over not being credited as a designer for sequel titles in the Aliens franchise. In the original 1979 film Alien, Giger based the extraterrestrial monsters after one of his 1976 paintings, Necronom IV. The original image comes from a FreeFoto stock photo of a white mallard from March 31st, 2003.[1] The image macros are rumored to have started on Memegenerator[2] in 2009 before being further popularized on 4chan's /b/ board. The earliest found images contain the Memegenerator watermark, providing some evidence to support this rumor.   A signature of the Initial D series (if not street racing itself) is drifting: an action where the rear of the car swings outward in a turn resulting in a high-speed, controlled skid. Multi-Track Drifting was accomplished in Densha de D by having the protagonist head into a double-tracked curve with his train in such a way that the rear wheel bogey jumps the tracks and replaces itself on the adjacent track, making the train appear to be drifting like a car would. Urban Dictionary[1] user rapelax submitted a definition for "The Family Guy effect" on August 22nd, 2008, defining the term as the effect of joke over-saturation. Do something funny. Continue to do so until said activity is no longer funny. Continue to do so until said activity is funny again. Repeat. On July 27th, 2009, the arts and culture blog Bygone Bureau[5] posted an interview with writer Nathan Rabin, who mentioned the Family Guy effect in relation to pop culture references: "Pop culture references can be such a dead end, too. I think there’s such as thing as the Family Guy effect, where if the reference is random and doesn’t have an emotional center to it, then it becomes very empty." The earliest known reference to the Family Guy Effect in the context of Internet memes was posted by former Know Your Meme community manager Chris Menning in the meme research forums on July 30th, 2009. In the thread, researcher TheGhostOfRichieRich questioned how to handle the documentation of memes that have been exposed to mainstream attention, citing the Family Guy episode featuring Chuck Norris as an example. Menning replied to the original post by calling this phenomenon “The Family Guy effect." The idea of pairing popular songs with audio samples of Team Fortress 2 characters was discussed on the Team Fortress 2 Fort forums[9] as early as October 23rd, 2007. Months later in early 2008, this idea was executed for the first time with a YouTube video titled "Bonk Song," featuring the TF2 character Scout's voice and the NFL on FOX theme song. Although the video was taken down after allegedly receiving a DMCA notice, it went onto inspire hundreds of other remixes bearing the same title and the audio sample. Meanwhile, similar audio-splicing techniques had been demonstrated prior to the creation of "Bonk Song," most notably through YouTube Poop Music Videos as early as 2005. Beginning late 2003,[1] Neil Cicierega (also notable for Animutations[4]) created his first flash animated Potter Puppet Pals video, "Bothering Snape."[2] In late September 2006, Neil published the first of the live action Potter Puppet Pals on his Youtube account.[3] Shortly after, in March of 2007 Neil released Potter Puppet Pals in "The Mysterious Ticking Noise." This video became one of Youtube's most popular videos for a time, accumulating over 72 million views during it's first two years on the site and has gained over 150 million views as of April 2014.     While the details of the original instance and its caption are unclear, both "Invisible Sandwich" and "Invisible Bike" began appearing online in the summer of 2006, coinciding with the rise of Caturday. The earliest mention of "Invisible Sandwich" was posted on sports blog McCovey Chronicles[1] on July 27th, 2006. The earliest appearance of "Invisible Bike" can be found YTMND[2] on August 20th of that year.    In competitive Super Smash Bros. Melee, common tournament tier lists regularly rank the character Fox McCloud as the top rank, currently occupying his own special rank of SS over the 25 other characters.[1] This is commonly attributed to Fox's high levels of versatility and speed, and is commonly proven to be a "jack of all trades, master of many." This makes Fox a very popular character among tournament players, making high level tournament play include an overabundance of Fox, oftentimes creating an impression that Fox is the only character allowed to be played. In competitive tournament play, the focus on skill over random chance and environmental exploitation oftentimes leads players to turn off randomly spawning items and impose self restrictions on many stages that provide any form of significant hazard banned from being played at events due to the unbalanced nature of the game. One of the most balanced stages in the game is Final Destination, which is simply a flat panel. These rules commonly leak into Casual Play, where open Stage Selection and Items are normally welcome, creating tension between the casual and tournament player. In the final scene of There Will Be Blood, released to critics in late 2007 and to wider audiences on January 25th, 2008,[1] pastor Eli Sunday approaches his ideological rival, oil baron Daniel Plainview, with an offer to sell Daniel the final piece of land in Little Boston unowned by Plainview, the Bandy Tract. After humiliating Eli, Daniel rejects his offer, explaining that the area had been "drilled" because the oil there had drained into the areas around it, which Plainview owned. Explaining this, Plainview says, "If you have a milkshake and I have a milkshake, and I have a straw, my straw reaches across the room and starts to drink your milkshake. I. Drink. Your. Milkshake! I drink it up!"  While the sound effect of laser-beam has been imitated by sci-fi movie fans for decades (most notably in Star Wars films), popular usage of "pew pew" in online conversations began to surge in mid-2005, around the same time when lolcat & lolspeak phenomena started gaining grounds on 4chan. The earliest definition of the phrase "pew pew" appeared on Urban Dictionary in August 2005: Captain Planet and the Planeteers[1] is an animated environmentalist television program that aired in the United States from September 1990 until December 1992. In the series, each of five Planeteers are given a ring which allows them to temporarily control one of the four classical elements--Earth, Fire, Wind, and Water--as well as the fifth element of Heart. When chanted out loud in the proper order and followed by the group's cheer "GO PLANET!", Captain Planet would appear from flashes of lightnings and sounds of thunders. Although its history of online usage remains somewhat murky, numerous online reference sites have attributed the gaming forum GameFAQs' LUE (Life, Universe and Everything) board[3][4] as the site of origin, with its earliest archived instance found in an IRC chat log submitted to Lue Games forum on March 18th, 2005. In Sonic R, the Tails Doll is unlockable by collecting five Sonic tokens in the Radical City course, finishing third, and beating the character in a race.[1]     The fetish was allegedly invented by John Martello, a Furry artist who has a particular interest in Dragons. He created the first images in May-June of 2004; as far as is known, there were only three images created at that point: Where and when these images were originally posted by Martello remains unknown, though based on his other NSFW dragon artworks, it can be inferred that these were not created as a joke. The assumption is that they were, in some form, made specifically as sexual fetish images, whether for himself or as a commissioned artwork for someone else (commissioning custom artworks is a common practice in furry fandom). These images remained unknown to a wider audience until February of 2007, at which point a user of DoodleDraw.com found these images. DoodleDraw.com was a Oekaki BBS similar to the still-running 2draw.net, and owned by Jay Stile, best known for the 4-chan precursor shock/porn site stileproject.com (later being sold and now functioning completely as a porn tube site). Being part of StileNet, DoodleDraw was thusly an NSFW, anything-goes Oekaki board, and many perverse images were drawn there. Rule 34 was just becoming a popular meme at this point, and DD users were happy to use their skills to propagate any ridiculous things they could find or come up with. When Martello's images were posted to the board, there was a certain level of disbelief that anyone could possibly have a real dragons-fucking-cars fetish because there was no backstory or credit to Martello that came with these images. Naturally, DD users decided to make as many images of dragons fucking cars as possible because, well, "Rule 34". These are all of the images that were saved directly from DoodleDraw. Here is a screenshot showing the original timestamps of those pictures. After having made these images, the DoodleDraw users posted them to many other forums as well as 4chan for giggles. In the following months, "dragons fucking cars" became a popular meme, though it was totally devoid of any backstory or relation to DoodleDraw, much like Martello's original images when they came to DoodleDraw. At some point, Martello must have seen DoodleDraw's homage to his perversion, and ended up making two or more images later which made it into the lexicon of the dragons fucking cars phenomenon: Dragons fucking cars became reasonably well known in the following years, though it didn't seem to become a full blown meme until the now-famous subreddit was created by /u/jymotion. Here are some images from 4chan from 2010 and 2011 (a full 4 years after most of these images were created) where the posters still only possessed strictly Martello and DoodleDraw images: Krystal (クリスタル / Kurisutaru) is a fictional character originally introduced in the 2002 Nintendo videogame "Star Fox Adventures"[1] and later included as a member of the mercenary group "Star Fox." On June 9th, 2007, FurAffinity[2] user "Cbee" poted a picture of Krystal from the Star Fox series eating a sandwich. On July 22nd, Cbee posted a landscape illustration with the same image of Krystal edited into the corner. In reference to the picture, the artist posted the following statement: Another user posted several instances of parodical image macros featuring Krystal unable to enjoy her meal due to the general disarray she was photoshopped atop of. According to Encyclopedia Dramatica[1] the phrase is inspired by the ending of the videogame Super Mario 64 where Princess Peach awards Mario with a delicious cake for saving her, an arguably small reward for such a dangerous endeavor. The 2007 video game Portal is also said to have inspired the meme, as it similarly tempts the player with cake for completing dangerous tasks, and its release coincides with the rise of the phrase. On January 13th, 2008, Giant in the Playground[4] forum user Pronounceable made a thread titled, "Why is Cake a Lie? [oops]" asking for the origins of the meme. Later that day, a user named Holammer posted a reply detailing how the "Delicious Cake" and The Cake Is a Lie memes started on Futuba Channel (which would eventually become 2chan before being removed from the web) as a signal for sharing child pornography and loli content on now-defunct message boards like 711chan and 12chan (shown below). This theory is supported in a now-removed March 6th, 2008, upload by YouTuber[3] anonymousexposed titled "Anonymous' exploitation of children" which describes the origins of the meme and includes screenshots of users on boards like 711chan and 12chan using the phrase to signal jailbait content (shown below in reupload). Although the meme began as a signal for loli content, that context seemed to have been somewhat forgotten when it was adopted by 4chan.  The song "smooooch・∀・" was written by a Japanese composer/DJ Kosuke Saito a.k.a kors k[2], and the animated video featuring three princesses dancing, was created by a Japanese illustrator Maya Takayama, better known as her alias MAYA. The song was first included in Beatmania IIDX 16 released for Japanese arcade in November 19th, 2008. The song has also been featured to other music video games in the BEMANI series, including Dance Dance Revolution X2, REFLEC BEAT and Pop'n Music. The exact origin of the "you laugh you lose" game is unknown, but a Google Trends search for the term shows a rise in interest starting in June 2007. The game likely began earlier than this date, but started spreading around June. The Encyclopedia Dramatica[2] entry for "You Laugh, You Lose," (created in 2007 and last updated 2010) claims the game started on 4chan board /b/ and states an alternative set of rules in which users post as offensive memes as possible, and if someone laughs they're deemed "unfit for society" and lose (quoted below): Many claim that You Laugh, You Lose threads used to be entirely different from what they are today. The idea being that you or somebody else posts an image that is seriously offensive. Anyone that laughs at the posted image, loses. Anyone who laughs is no longer considered a functioning member of society and therefore loses. I suppose anyone who laughs at these threads is still no longer a functioning member of society, so not much has changed really. An early example of the game outside of 4chan can be seen on an Ultimate Metal[1] forums post titled, "You laugh, you lose…" from June 24th, 2007, in which the post creator describes "the rules" via a ??? PROFIT!!! format (shown below). The post was extremely popular, resulting in over 5,000 replies over the course of eight years. The game became associated with a number of image macros, typically using images of people on the phone and featuring a variation of the phrase, "What's that? I laugh I lose?" used to signal a "you laugh you lose" thread on various 4chan board (examples shown below, center and right). One of the earliest of these shows an Asian man on a cellphone under the text, "wuts dat? I raff I ruse?" which has been used in countless 4chan posts (shown below, left). "The Internet is Serious Business" was first coined sometime in 2003 by General Mayhem forum member mr_brett in one of the cat-themed GIF animations which he titled "Catbusiness." Although the exact date of Mr_Brett's post remains unknown, it is thought have been uploaded sometime between 2002 and 2003, as implied by the follow-up request thread "pls post kittah – internet is serious business pic"[1] posted on February 27th, 2003.  Rainbow Road[1] is a recurring stage from the Nintendo[2] video game series Mario Kart[3], which was first released for the SNES[4] on September 1st, 1992 in North America. On February 20th, 2008, YouTube account RhymesWithStomach[5] released a video by the name of "Rainbow Road", in which singer Mark Krump sings to the Rainbow Road audio track from Mario Kart: Double Dash[6], the fourth game in the series, which was released on the Gamecube[7]. The original photograph was taken by a Canadian couple who were vacationing at Lake Mineewanka; they set up their tripod on some rocks and posed for a picture together, when a squirrel was drawn by the shutter click and took the center stage. They submitted the photo to a National Geographic contest. The magazine posted it to an online gallery on Aug. 7. Photoshop enthusiasts have added the furry scene-stealer to family portraits, famous paintings, and even to the top of the Queen's hat with a pile of nuts.    Super Macho Man Made his debut appearance in the 1985 sequel to the original arcade version of Punch-Out, _Super Punch-Out!![2] Champion of the World Video Boxing Association, he is considered the most powerful opponent in the game, utilizing his insta-knockdown 360-degree Macho Punch on unsuspecting victims. Super Macho Man would later appear in every succeeding iteration of the Punch-Out!! games. The soundbite originates from a scene in The Spongebob Movie when Spongebob's states they will party until they are purple. Patrick responds to this statement with "GAH! I LOVE BEING PURPLE!". Patrick: That sounds like the manager of the new Krusty Krab 2- oops, hold on… Congratulations, buddy! Spongebob: Aw, thanks patrick, and tonight after my big promotion, we're gonna party 'till we're purple. Patrick: GAH! I LOVE BEING PURPLE! The earliest known online discussion about the phrase appeared on the personal blog All-Encompassingly[1] on August 14th, 2004. The post was accompanied by a low-resolution photograph of an automatic hand dryer with the phrase "push button, receive bacon" tagged underneath (shown below). On September 7th, 2005, photographer Rick Lee[2] posted an article recounting how the phrase came to him years earlier; although even he is unsure if it spread from him, or if the phrase "push button receive bacon" might be a common conclusion many people might come to.    Caturday originated on 4Chan's /b/ in the mid-2000s. Urban Dictionary's earliest definition was added on October 24th, 2006.[1] One of the earliest archived Caturday threads from 4chan was started on December 12th, 2006.[2] While the typographical error "teh" most likely became commonplace with the advents of personal computers and QWERTY keyboards, its deliberate usage is thought to have started in the late 1990s to early 2000s with real-time chat in online gaming. The earliest Urban Dictionary definition[3] of "teh," submitted on November 23rd, 2002, also explains the phenomenon as a "deliberate typo error of 'the' used in online gaming discussion." As of May 2012, Urban Dictionary[2] lists a total of 63 entries defining the meaning and usage of "teh."  While the original photographer of the image is still unknown, several people have claimed to know its origin. Encyclopedia Dramatica[1] states that the cat belongs to Wikipedia user Samguana[2] but this claim has not been confirmed. In May 2012, Something Awful poster Quarex claimed[18] that they were friends with the cat's owner, posting a similar photo of the cat from a different angle. The user also said the cat in the photo passed away in 2010. The photo that would go on to become the image macro has been online since as early as June 1st, 2003 when it was submitted to FunnyJunk.[3] The photo was titled "Stalker Kitty" and did not receive any comments for four years. It was not paired with the phrase "Ceiling cat is watching you masturbate" until 2006 at the earliest. The captioned image first spread via YTMND, with the earliest site created on February 8th, 2006.[4] Several other sites[5] were created that year, but there have been fewer instances of Ceiling Cat appearing on YTMND for each subsequent year. Two days after the initial YTMND was created, CeilingCat.com[6] was created. Ceiling-cat.com[7] was created November 22nd, 2006, solely hosting the captioned image. Blendtec, a company which produces blenders, uploaded their first "Will it Blend" video to their official YouTube channel[3] on October 30th, 2006. In the video Dickson tries to blend 50 marbles on the blender's lowest setting. It successfully crushes the marbles into glass dust, enabling the video to declare, "Yes, it blends!" As of March 2014, the video has over 6.4 million views. Under My Skin is Paffendorf's 13th single release in 2005. The song actually used in this video series is not the original club mix, but Jens O.remix included in the release (shown below, left). Meanwhile, the earliest known rendition of the meme was entitled Paffendorf and featured Momoko Kuzuryua from the Japanese manga/anime series Sumomomo Momomo[2], bobbing her head to the sped up arrangement of this song. It was first uploaded on a now-defunct GeoCities webpage[3] and later on YouTube in April 2007 (shown below, right). On July 29th, 2009, Newgrounds Forum[1] member MetalStar submitted a three-pane comic template image featuring screen captures from The Race to Witch Mountain in a new thread. Over the course of the next 10 months, the thread gained over 690 responses, many of which featured customized versions of the template (shown below). The three panels were taken from a Race to Witch Mountain scene in which Jack Bruno (played by Dwayne Johnson) unexpectedly discovers two children in the backseat of his cab (shown below). The fish biscuit first made its appearance in the Lost episode 'A Tale Of Two Cities'. In this episode, Sawyer and Kate are held prisoners in two cages. While Kate is treated reasonably well, Sawyer is left to fend for himself. In order to get food, Sawyer must solve the puzzle of a device in his cage. When he solves the puzzle, he is rewarded with a salmon colored biscuit in the shape of a fish. This biscuit, branded with the word 'Dharma' is aptly called a fish biscuit. Soon after Sawyer begins celebrating his reward, he is approached by the Other named Tom, who observes that he has a fisbiscuit. He asks 'how'd you get that?' to which Sawyer replies, 'I figured out your complicated gizmo'. Tom then replies with 'it only took the bears three hours'. Later, Sawyer gives his fish biscuit to Kate.  Around 2004, a photoshopped image of the American Yo-kai having a giant shadow with a single large eye began to be often used as a reaction image for yelling at lolicon[3] people in Futaba's /b/ (Nijiura) boards. The common caption to the image "Damn All You Lolicon!" (このロリコンどもめ!, Kono Rorikon Domome!) came to characterize Backbeard as the lolicon-opposing Yo-kai among Futaba users, and it also caused photoshop and exploitable memes featuring both Backbeard and this catchphrase on the Japanese largest imageboard. Inspired by this Backbeard popularity on Futaba, a Japanese illustrator Torotei (とろてい) drew a loli girl as Backbeard's daughter and posted the character Beako (ベア子) to his blog on September 11th, 2005.[4] The banhammer originates from MSN Chat (originally called Microsoft Chat), which was created in 1996.[1] MSN Chat was a Microsoft Network version of the Internet Relay Chat (IRC). In these chatrooms, non-staff users could be given special functions in the channels to allow for certain types of moderation.[2] The two positions that could be handed out were "owner" and "host", which were respectively marked by a golden hammer (shown below, left) or brown hammer (shown below, right) icon next to the user's name. Although the functions coming with the type of hammers may differ based on the client used, the functions given to the users with hammer icons commonly involved kicking and banning. For this reason the hammer icons were often given the nickname "banhammer". In 2003, Microsoft closed its unregulated chat rooms due to problems with spam and a constant danger of predators. On October 16th, 2006, MSN Chat shut down their servers, as MSN no longer deemed it profitable to run. The hammer icons can still be found back in other clients such as Sparkpea Chat,[3] but most servers currently use symbols to show a person's status in a IRC chat room.     On July 19th, 2004, the third episode of Pure Pwnage, "FPS Doug," premiered. The episode introduces the character FPS Doug (portrayed by Joel F. Gardiner), who specializes in "First Person Shooter" video games and yells, "Boom! Headshot!" whenever he successfully shoots a video game opponent in the head (shown below). Two years later, on January 18th, 2006, YouTuber georgebush000 uploaded the video, receiving more than 11 million views in less than 15 years.  The concept of soundboard prank calling most likely began sometime in late 1990s, following the release of Macromedia Flash and the earliest known internet prank-call radio show "Blackout" in 1995. Generally, a soundboard is built by compiling audio clips of a chosen subject into an interactive Flash-based sound player. The date on which this phenomena presented itself is unknown, and many speculate that it is almost as old as the Internet itself.  In 1994, puzzle game, Hotel Mario, was released for the Phillip CD-i, one of several CD-i games published by Nintendo as part of an agreement with Philips[1], a diversified technology company based in The Netherlands. The game itself was widely was panned and is considered one of the worst Mario games of all time due to its unresponsive controls and repetitive gameplay. However, like Zelda: Wand of Gamelon and Link: The Faces of Evil, the game became known for its humorous full motion video (FMV) cutscenes, including the All Toasters Toast Toast scene. Oolong the rabbit was born on July 28th, 1994 in Hokkaido, Japan. Oolong's owner, Hironori Akutagawa, began posting photos of the rabbit on his personal website[1] in 1998. The first photo of Oolong balancing an object on his head was posted on May 24th, 1999[7], with one film canister (shown below, left). Oolong did not balance a pancake on his head (shown below, right) until February 12th, 2000.[12] Over the course of Oolong's life, Akutagawa took hundreds of photographs of the rabbit balancing a wide variety of small, light objects on its head, which he called "head performance." Despite Oolong's death on January 7th, 2003[8], Akutagawa continued to update the homepage through September 23rd, 2003[9], when he posted the negatives of the final photos taken of Oolong, balancing ice on his head. The wedding ceremony of Jill Peterson and Kevin Heinz took place at Christ Lutheran Church in Saint Paul, Minnesota on June 2nd, 2009. The video opens with ushers closing the church door to mark the beginning of the ceremony, then Chris Brown's 2009 single "Forever" suddenly begins to play. To the pleasant surprise of the audience, what follows is a charming parade of the ushers, groomsmen and bridesmaid dancing down the aisle, which gradually builds up to the entrance and union of the groom Kevin Heinz and the bride Jill Peterson. According to the bride, the group practiced the choreography for an hour and a half before the wedding. The video was recorded by Tommy Alsop and uploaded via YouTube more than a month later on July 19th, at the request of the bride's father who wanted to share the video with relatives who couldn't come to the wedding. Within the first 48 hours of upload, the video accrued more than 3.5 million views and quickly spread across the blogosphere and mainstream news outlets. As of July 2012, the video has accumulated more than 76 million views.  Houston-based producer DJ Screw is widely credited with popularizing the concoction and its affiliation with the hip hop sub-genre known as "chopped and screwed." Both the drug and the music scene initially gained momentum in Houston, Texas before spreading to other Southern states. In June of 2000, Three 6 Mafia’s single “Sippin’ on Some Syrup” featuring UGK brought the term “Purple Drank” to a nationwide audience. A notable variation of the drink known as “rainbow colors” combines multiple brands of cough syrup in different colors and a Jolly Rancher candy, which creates a spectrum of hues reminiscent of a rainbow as the liquids blend together. Other cough syrup-based drinks have been given similar nicknames based on their unique colors, including “yellow syrup” and “pink syrup”. Although his EarthBound counterpart is most associated with the name, Giygas originally appeared as the final boss of Mother, which was only sold in Japan.[1] In Mother, Giygas is displayed as an alien with human-like figure trapped inside of a shell. In EarthBound, Giygas is incapable of speaking sanely, saying things such as "It hurts…" and "Ness, Ness, Ness, Ness". In both Mother and EarthBound, the player's party is incapable of defeating Giygas by fighting, and must sing a lullaby in the former, and pray in the latter game. In an interview with EarthBound Central, Shigesato Itoi, Mother's creator, said that Giygas's creepy dialogue and appearance in EarthBound was influenced by a traumatic moment in his childhood, where he accidentally walked into a theater showcasing the movie "The Military Policeman and the Dismembered Beauty", witnessing a scene which he interpreted as murder and rape.[2]    On March 2nd, 2008, YouTuber YouGotDaveGrolled uploaded an edited version of the music video for the song "Best of You" by the Foo Fighters, in which a clip of the lead singer David Grohl singing the lyric "the best" is looped for several minutes (shown below).   The exact origin of the catchphrase is unknown. It was first defined on Urban Dictionary on January 23rd, 2003 by user DictionaryX as "Vernacular, commonly used by males, meaning, 'I would like to have sexual relations with that female.'" As of September 25th, 2015, the definition 3551 upvotes and 253 downvotes.[1] The origin of "MOAR" is unknown. It is most commonly used in image macros alongside pictures of various figures shouting or roaring to show urgency and is typically used to demand more of the content (usually pornographic) posted by the OP or a source for said content. The term goes back to at least 2005, as evidenced by a YTMND[5] site titled "NEEDS MOAR ZEPPELIN!!!!!" created on November 5th, 2005, featuring an image of a baby in a Led Zeppelin onesie screaming, garnering over 3,400 views in 16 years. On March 17th, 2006, Urban Dictionary user grrr_argh defined "MOAR" as "A combination of 'more' and 'roar,'" which may explain why it is spelled in all caps and used alongside images of shouting people or roaring animals. According to Encyclopedia Dramatica,[1] the term began on 4chan's /b/ (random) board. This is unconfirmed, but possible, as the term was largely used by the board in the early to late 2000s. Some early examples of the word in image macros appear in 2008, including a BlogSpot[2] blog titled "moarmoar" that began in March 2008, and a number of image macros featuring the word on WikiMedia[3] and Nasty Hobbit[4] (shown below, left and right). According to the YTMND Wiki[2], the phrase is a derivative of "Nigga stole my TV!"[3] which started on the OffTopic.com[4] forums sometime in 2002. The image of the Punch-Out!! cutscene was posted as part of a Something Awful Photoshop Phriday[5] contest held on March 20th, 2003. Created by SA forum user Allanon858, the still was taken from a training cutscene in which the protagonist, Little Mac, is shown jogging after his trainer riding a bike. According to the Korean news daily Hankyure[3], the term "Solo Regiment" was coined in late 2003 by single-status users of Korean imageboard site DCInside.[1] It is a portmanteau of "Solo (솔로)," an English loanword commonly used to describe singles, and the military unit term "Regiment (부대)." The colloquial use of "Regiment" to describe any specific demographic (ex: Madam Kim regiment and "Necktie Regiment" as in salarymen) can be attributed to a strange lingo culture bred through South Korea's all-male mandatory military service. In 2004, web developer George Taylor McKnight[9] began taking a photo every day as a personal challenge for himself as well as a way to hone his photography skills. He named the endeavor Project 365[8], then took a year off before resuming again in 2006[10], this time using Flickr to host his photos and starting a group[11] to encourage other users on the site to join in. Though his second project has since been removed, the Project 365 group has grown to 26,311 members as of June 2012, with 1,496,689 photos in the pool.  The flash video was first uploaded to Albino Blacksheep on October 30th, 2003 and credited to user Fluid (shown below).[1] On January 8th, Microsoft released the application and a bunch of support material, including a promo video they called: Everyone Has A Song Inside. While many would argue the video disproves this aphorism, the video's plot involves a man (played by Microsoft engineer Dan Morris) who is struggling to find an angle for advertising some glow in the dark towels. While complaining about this in his kitchen in the morning, his eerily chipper daughter begins to sing. She's using songsmith on what is pretty clearly a Macbook Pro covered in stickers. It remains unknown exactly why Microsoft used an Apple laptop in the commercial, but the crowd on YouTube loved it. To quote user rmbgi, "I thinks this works better with a Macbook pro :) The apple logo is covered with stickers LOL…﻿" Anyway, the dad goes and sits with his daughter. He is blown away by the quality of the program, and, perhaps not understanding that a free trial is available for download, steals the laptop from his daughter. The video cuts to the next scene, which is in a coffee shop. He has just finished recording the first take of his glow-in-the-dark towel jingle, and begins to play it back. Right as he hits play, a rockstar (played by Microsoft Engineer Sumit Basu) and a waitress (neither of which seem to have any respect for his privacy) watch over his shoulder. After a few bars, the rock star says the classic, "Microsoft, huh? So it's pretty easy to use?" The rock star later records his own song in the coffee shop, and the man uses songsmith to create a jingle for the glow-in-the-dark towels, and everyone goes home happy. It is a huge success, and everyone lives happily ever after. This video in itself would have been viral, but what turned this into a meme was the fact that users could download the app and play with it themselves. The original was taken from a page of the 14th issue of DC's comic series 52 published August 2006: The original comic featured a middle panel of a flashback featuring a discussion between Dr. Magnus' and a past professor who explained to him that he had created an Artificial Soul (a step above artificial intelligence). The panels used in the meme were adapted and an extra panel was swapped for the flashback to give users context for the joke. This character was created by artist Brian Lee[3], known for his comic "The Adventures of Left and Right."[4] On March 27th, 2008, Lee posted a comic titled "BROTERSTORY"[1] to his deviantArt account, noting that now-deactivated dA user appletrees[5] requested a Super Smash Brothers inspired comic for a zine to be distributed at Seattle anime convention SakuraCon. In the comic, Toon Link is shown posing in this excited manner after he and Solid Snake decide to sneak around other characters to visit Ganondorf in the hospital.   Xbox 360 Kid originally came from EB Games and Gamestop's 2006 Holiday gift guide. The "Row Row Fight The Powah" catchphrase is the altered line of the "Raw Raw Fight The Power" lyric and can be initially found in three different songs from the anime series Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann (天元突破グレンラガン). The catchphrase is used in three songs from the series' Original Soundtrack (OST):  The original video was produced as a "Digital Short" by The Lonely Island, creators of Like a Boss and I'm on a Boat,, which premiered on the sketch comedy television show Saturday Night Live (SNL) on December 16th, 2006. Said to be based on late 1980s R&B acts, the video featured actor Andy Samberg and performer Justin Timberlake attempting to woo women by presenting them with the gift of their penises in a gift-wrapped box. The video also describes the suitability of the gift for any occasion, from Christmas to "backstage at the CMAs," and provides a list of steps to present the gift. The site was first launched in 1999 under the domain name Goatse.cx. According to the Wikipedia entry,[2] the earliest known instance of the shock image was uploaded circa 1997 as "gap3.jpg" in a set of 40 additional images compressed into a single zip file named "Gap.zip." According to Gawker's investigative report published in April 2012,[5] the photo set initially spread across gay porn communities on Usenet and was later picked up by The Stiles Project. The dark side is coined in Star Wars, but the phrase 'we have cookies' has been added on.        Following the events of September 11th, 2001, an image surfaced on the Internet supposedly found in a camera recovered from the debris of the World Trade Center. The image depicted a man dressed in a wool cap, heavy jacket and backpack, standing on the observation deck of the World Trade Center while a jet plane can be seen flying towards the building that seems certain to collide with the tower due to its proximity. The image was sent en masse via e-mail with a message claiming that the photo was authentic: "We've seen thousands of pictures concerning the attack. However, this one will make you cringe. A simple tourist getting himself photographed on the top of the WTC just seconds before the tragedy … the camera was found in the rubble!!"  In January 2004, Howard Dean's campaign team suffered a defeat when a last-minute popularity surge by rival candidates John Kerry and John Edwards led to a disappointing third-place finish for the Vermont congressman at Iowa's Democratic caucuses, which represents the symbolic beginning of the primary campaign season. In the following days of Iowa caucus results, Howard Dean attended a post-caucus rally for his supporters at the Val-Air Ballroom in West Des Moines, Iowa for concession speech. Not only are we going to New Hampshire, Tom Harkin, we're going to South Carolina and Oklahoma and Arizona and North Dakota and New Mexico, and we're going to California and Texas and New York … And we're going to South Dakota and Oregon and Washington and Michigan, and then we're going to Washington, D.C., to take back the White House! Yeah!!! Because of the loud cheers of his enthusiastic audience, Dean was forced to raise his voice in delivery; however, the overwhelming noise from the crowd was filtered out by his unidirectional microphone, thus giving an impression to the audiences at home that he was "loud, peculiar, and unpresidential," according to Verne Gay's column article in the Seattle Times.[1]  On July 16th, 2005, the 6th Harry Potter book, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, was released. It was revealed that the character Severus Snape, a teacher at Hogwarts, kills Dumbledore near the end of the book. The spoiler quickly spread across the internet, usually accompanied with an image of a scanned page of the book: We Know Something You Don't Know is a song from the 2003 album Music for the Mature B-Boy, from the Southampton artist, DJ Format. It was released as the first single from the album on 10 March 2003 and reached #73 in the UK Singles Chart. The music video featured breakdancing animals, the most notable being a dancing bear. The video evolved online mostly in the form of short animated gifs--despite the fact that few knew where they came from or the song they were associated with. In particular, a break-dancing sequence involving the dancer in the bear suit was parodied and redrawn many times with different characters in his place. On August 23rd, 2005, The Mighty Boosh episode "The Legend of Old Gregg" aired on the United Kingdom-based television network BBC. In the episode, the character Howard (played by Julian Barratt) accidentally pulls a merman named Old Gregg (played by Noel Fielding) out of the water, who flashes Howard his female genitalia and takes him to his cave. After Howard regains consciousness, Old Gregg pressures Howard into staying and tells the story of "The Funk," an alien creature responsible for the rise of funk music. "You ever drink Bailey's from a shoe?" "You ever go to a club where people wee on each other?" "I'm Old Gregg! I've got a mangina!"     The phrase is frequently misattributed to a film adaptation of the H.G. Wells science fiction story Empire of the Ants[8] was released on July 29th, 1977, which revolved around giant mutated ants attempting to destroy humankind. In the film, actress Joan Collins reacts to the insect threat by saying a similar line, "Don’t you see, we mustn’t’ disobey them. We must take care of them and we must help them."[24] The quote gained popularity after the airing of the 1994 episode of The Simpsons, “Deep Space Homer”,[9] in which news announcer Kent Brockman mistakenly assumes the Earth is about to be invaded by giant space ants. Fearing for his life, he announces his willingness to submit to the imagined invaders. <center "One thing is for certain: there is no stopping them; the ants will soon be here. And I for one welcome our new insect overlords. I'd like to remind them that as a trusted TV personality, I can be helpful in rounding up others to toil in their underground sugar caves." According to the Wayback Machine,[1] YouTuber arcobalenoverde posted the earliest known version of the video on February 27th, 2007. The video, entitled "THE LEGEND! Hamster piano and pop corn – Criceto e popcorn!" featured the hamster on the piano and featured the song "Don't Be Cruel" by Elvis Presley on the soundtrack (mirror below). The video has since been deleted and credited to Antonio Galati.  BodyBuilding Forums[1] user badboy2 posted a thread titled "I'm 18, do I have potential?" on October 30th, 2005, which featured a photograph of a shirtless man flexing in front of a window (shown left). The same day, forum member Brer Ben replied with an edited version of the photo, featuring various pirate accessories edited on to badboy2's likeness (shown right). Several other photoshopped versions were subsequently posted, eventually leading to over 7,600 replies prior to its removal in November of 2010. In the summer of 1998, Fox 5 News reporter Melissa Sander went on-location at the Chateau Elan Winery and Resort to report on an upcoming grape-stomping competition. During the report, which takes place on a platform multiple feet off the ground where two buckets of grapes sit, a staff member asks Sander to stomp grapes with her. The reporter agrees and stomps grapes with the employee. At one point Sander playfully tricks the employee by suddenly saying "stop" and waving her hands. The employee stops and Sander quickly continues to stomp the grapes, then loses her balance and falls face-first out of the bucket and off the platform into the grass below. Sander begins wailing in pain, repeatedly saying "stop" and that she can't breathe before the report fades back to the newsroom. The video first went viral in 2004 before YouTube launched and was passed around video websites like Revver and VideoVat as evidenced by an article about it published to Method Shop[2] on May 16th, 2004. It was first posted to YouTube by YouTuber[1] drewlacrosse17 on August 15th, 2006, gaining over 3.6 million views in 15 years (shown below).   The video was taken during the finale of a Judson Laipply show called "Inspirational Comedy". Judson Laipply[1], an American motivational speaker, originally began closing many of his college, high school and corporate appearances with his unusual dance medley. He uploaded the dance to YouTube on April 6th, 2006. During the second half of 2003 East Asian Football Championship match, Chinese forward Li Yi kicked Eul-Young's right shin after he completed a pass. Recently recovering from an ankle injury, Eul Young became upset and slapped Li on the back of his head, prompting the tackler to overreact and roll on the ground. The game came to a brief stop and the referee gave Li a yellow-card warning for simulation while Eul-Young was given a red card and escourted out of the game for inciting violence. The original advertisement came from a popup ad for ContentWatch, the makers of Net Nanny software. In 2007, YouTube user gnomebob (current account: xMAHATMAxGHANDIx[1]) uploaded "LUIGI WINDS A TOY WHILE I PLAY UNFITTING MUSIC." The original video was deleted, but was later reuploaded on the user's new account (shown below). The TV anime series for Azumanga Daioh was aired in Japan from April to September in 2002, which was produced by J.C.Staff. And it had been also aired in other countries, later years. Its opening theme song "Soramimi Cake" is sung by Oranges & Lemons, a Japanese pop music unit consisted of Masumi Itō[1] and Yoko Ueno.[2] On April 27th, 2008, Latarian stole his grandmother's Dodge Durango and "ran over two mailboxes, hit two parked cars in a Costco parking lot and struck two moving cars near a Wal-Mart" before ending the several mile long joyride.[1] West Palm Beach Newstation WPBF interviewed him the day after, and uploaded the interview to YouTube the same day.  Aired on April 8th, 2000, the comedy sketch parodied VH!'s music documentary series "Behind the Music" fictionalizing the studio recording of the 1976 song "(Don't Fear) The Reaper" by Blue Öyster Cult. The sketch featured guest host Christopher Walken as music producer Bruce Dickinson and Will Ferrell as fictional cowbell player, Gene Frenkle. In the sketch, which is transcribed here, Dickinson (played by Christopher Walken) says "Well, guess what! I've got a fever, and the only prescription is more cowbell!" While the song actually includes a cowbell, Frenkle is a fictional character. In 2005, Washington Post reported that fans, even five years later, still asked the band about Frenkle. Newgrounds user DrForeman[1] initially posted the photo on April 27th, 2009 in a thread titled “Embarrassing Childhood Photos”[2] with the caption “it’s embarrassing because i know none of you guys look this good.” Seven minutes later, DrForeman started a new thread titled “The Beast Awakens,”[3] in which he outlined his weekly workout routines to celebrate his second year of progress and abs finally showing through. At the end of his post, he asked for feedback “and no haters” before attaching the photo. The first response pointed out the man’s elongated neck, which was further highlighted by the first derivative image posted less than ten minutes later. The nickname “Dick Neck” did not appear until the third page[4] of the thread, when moderator EyeLovePoozy called out the original poster for blatant attention seeking. Four days later, the thread was locked.  The question first appeared in a thread on the /v/ (video games) board on 4chan about an upcoming Wii game The Conduit on February 12th, 2009. The original post featured a link to a YouTube video of someone playing the beta version of the game, accompanied by list of notable features. An anonymous user responded to the post asking "Has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like?" (shown below). Several users attempted to decipher the question, speculating that it was asking if a video game company had ever gone to such great lengths to make a game appear realistic. The phrase began on 4chan, though the original thread is probably long gone. However, there are many places that reference the phrase's origin. On the DTTW Table Tennis Forum in early September 2006, someone said the phrase and asked the OP if they were "/b/rothers." On November 13, 2006, someone posted a lengthy copypasta of the Rules of the Internet to their blog, directly attributing it to 4chan. In this version, rule 57 out of 88 is "If balls are touching, it is gay." The phrase did not appear on Urban Dictionary until January 2007. In the version of the Rules on the Rules Of The Internet wiki, Rule 57 is "You will never have sex." There is no reference to balls touching in this version. [work in progress] The Bunchie was created by designer Aaron St. Goddard[1] and animated by Roel Van Mastbergen[2] and is believed to have been popularized when a user named Kelet posted the animated GIF as a humorous response to a serious thread on the Penny Arcade forums. Because of this, the character became known as a Kelet amongst Penny Arcade users. The phrase was spoken by Arnold Schwarzenegger's character, Major Alan "Dutch" Schaefer, in the 1987 sci-fi action movie Predator[1] in a helicopter evacuation scene after the rest of Dutch's team had been killed off by the Predator. Before confronting the monster, Major Schaefer yells the line to get Anna safely onboard the chopper. Liam Kyle Sullivan created the character "Kelly" as a stereotypical American girl who enjoys shopping, texting and dating, portraying her by cross-dressing with a blonde wig, leather jacket and striped knee-high socks. Inspired by the titular character from Napoleon Dynamite and MTV cartoon character Butthead, Sullivan has described her personality as "kind of bored and everything sucks [to her], except for shoes."[15] Sullivan began incorporating Kelly into his stand-up comedy act in 2005[16], performing the song live a handful of times before committing it to video. The full "Shoes" music video with an introductory skit was originally uploaded to his personal website[1] in 2006. On May 5th, 2006, he uploaded a shortened version[2] to his YouTube account, liamkylesullivan[3]. Over six years, the abridged version garnered 3.8 million views. In February 2007, after the success of the music video, Sullivan re-uploaded the full version with the skit in tact to his YouTube account, which has 46,744,651 views and 771,681 Facebook shares[17] as of May 2012. The Diet Coke and Mentos experiment as an internet phenomenon began taking off in June 2006, when Fritz Grobe and Stephen Voltz of EepyBird[4] uploaded a YouTube video demonstrating the fusion of 200 liters of Diet Coke and more than 500 Mentos mints. The video was shot in one take on April 29th, 2006 and uploaded to their personal website on June 3rd.[5] Within 16 hours, the video had been watched 14,000 times.[9] It was reposted on YouTube on June 14th, 2006, where it has garnered 15,340,667 views as of July 2012. Spengbab's origin is unknown, but some of the first known appearances of this type of fanart, as well as uses of the word, come from 2006. The first recorded use of "Spengbab" is in a DeviantArt post from December, 2006 by the user LusoSkav, who drew a piece of grotesque Spongebob fanart. But a month earlier, user russxl had posted a video entitled "spongebab" to YouTube, which also featured many instances of deformed Spongebobs. It is unclear if these were drawn by the YouTube user or not; the video has acquired more than 350,000 views as of March, 2016. However, other sources, including Encyclopedia Dramatica, point to 4chan's /b/ board as the origin of the meme. An archive of 4chan-based memes on Wikipedia claims that the term was first used in a YouTube video, but then popularized via 4chan.  The first recorded instance of the expression can be found in the comments section of a YouTube anime music video[15] uploaded on November 5th, 2006. What episode did he died? And when did he cut is hair? posted 4 years ago by 57682835 Although its exact site of origin or the backstory remains unknown, the phrase became closely associated with comment trolling in FAIL videos on YouTube and Cheezburger's FAILBlog before spreading to other videos on YouTube. The earliest known iteration of "did he died?" in the context of FAIL was posted in July 2007 to a YouTube video of a soccer player getting injured during a game.[7] The phrase was first defined on Urban Dictionary[4] in December 2008. The first video was uploaded to YouTube on May 28th, 2008 by YouTuber bobtel08.[1] The 30 second clip (shown below, right) shows a group of four people sitting around a table, with four cellphones arranged around a few popcorn kernels. When they dial the numbers of the cell phones on the table, the phones start to vibrate and the kernels can be seen popping off the table. A second 45 second clip (shown below, left) was uploaded the following day, with three people betting over whether or not it would work. As of July 2012, the clips have more than 10 million combined views.      The Staredad cartoon originally came from a custom comic by KC Green titled “Dad Wasps Oh No."[1] In it, a young boy rushes into a room where his father is reading to tell him that there are wasps in his room. The dad replies “So.” to which the boy replies “I’m scared.” The next panel, the Dad’s reaction, is what grew to be known as “Staredad.” The rest of the comic finds the Dad grabbing the wasps' nest, putting it in his mouth, scaring the child, then screaming “I have no son.” Only the first four panels became an exploitable meme.   Although it remains unclear who first coined the term "Myspace angles," the practice of photographing oneself at a flattering angle arose sometime in the early 2000s with the introduction of consumer-grade digital cameras and early social networking sites like Friendster[1], LiveJournal and MySpace.[2] Such online behavior shaped by vanity and self-image can be also observed elsewhere across different languages and cultures. For example, on the Korean web, the same angling technique is referred to as Ulzzang ("best face") angle.  The unicode character "ಠ" comes from the letter "ṭha" in Kannada, one of the major Dravidian languages of India that is influenced by Sanskrit. Despite its origin, the character has been used as an emoticon primarily outside of India. According to Lurkmore Wiki, the earliest use of ಠ_ಠ began on the Japanese imageboard site 2channel and eventually spread across other languages, most notably on 4chan. Mike Godwin coined his observation as a "natural law of Usenet" in 1990. For more information about Godwin's Law, check out the original FAQ page.[1] According to the online slang dictionary Jargon File: The earliest known archived 4chan[2] thread featuring Woll Smoth was posted to the /b/ (random) board (shown below, left) on November 14th, 2007, which received 334 responses within 7 hours. Several users replied with photographs of other celebrities that had been edited with their eyes and mouth reduced in size (shown below, right).   Mikuru Beam appeared in "The Adventures of Mikuru Asahina Episode 00", the first episode in the first season of the TV anime series The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya which was aired in Japan between April 2nd and July 2nd, 2006. This is a sort of prologue of the series, and the whole of the footage is a play within a play by a movie directed by Haruhi. (The scene can be seen from 0:52 to 0:55) via: Wikipedia[1]   In January 2009, Germany's Federal Ministry of Family Affairs launched the first government initiative towards more strict censorship of child pornography on the Internet. Formally known as the Access Impediment Act, it was drafted under the leadership of the Family Affairs minister Ursula von der Leyen[1], one of the staunchest advocates of Internet censorship in the federal government. The Act proposed a mandatory blockage of online child pornography by Internet service providers through a blacklist of illegal websites maintained by the Federal Criminal Police Office of Germany (BKA). In the following days, the legislative proposal sparked a political debate among German Internet users about whether the state may or should have an infrastructure to censor the internet. "Yiff" was originally coined as a greeting, to be used while roleplaying as a fox. Over time, it began to be used as a term for sexual activities, and furry pornography.[1][2] One of the earliest examples of the phrase comes from a 1997 Sabrina Online comic (shown below), though some say that it dates back even further to the early 90s.[2] The style began with "THIS VIDEO CONTAINS WIN", a video created by YouTube User McMaNGOS[2]. This video consisted of a static image of Dr. Robotnik from a TV anime series The Adventures of Sonic The Hedgehog with a clip of Robotnik saying PINGAS, sequenced to the song Gourmet Race from Kirby Super Star. The video was uploaded on May 4th, 2008, but was later deleted.   In early October 2006, Yale University student Aleksey Vayner applied for a job at the Swedish investment bank UBS AG. Vayner's video begins with Vayner asking the rhetorical question "How do some people like yourself become very proficient in their field much faster than most?" to which he provides a six-minute answer. Highly amused by Vayner's over-the-top video resume, an employee at the bank forwarded his application to other investment banks, including Lehman Brothers, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Credit Suisse Group and Wachovia. (Shown below is a HD re-upload from 2016)  On August 22nd, 2006, Gunnar Stansson and Logan Hodge, a couple of high school mates and aspiring filmmakers, uploaded a short video titled "unforgivable," in which Stansson delivers an improvised monologue in the woods about visiting the mall with a woman and engaging in sexual intercourse with her (shown below). In the video, cameraman L.W. Hodge[6] can be heard laughing throughout the story. The original upload has since been removed. The video was originally filmed in 1988 as a promotional video for Winnebago recreational vehicles. During the shoot of the commercial, Rebney, a former broadcast journalist, got incredibly upset between takes. Unknown members of the production team decided to compile and circulate his outbursts via VHS.    On February 14th, 2006, Randy Hayes and Xavier Nazario of My Way Entertainment[3] made an overdub of an X-Men animated series episode titled "Phoenix Saga Part 3: Cry of the Banshee" and uploaded it to their YouTube channel.[1] Relying heavily on profanity for its humor, the video quickly spread on YouTube but was removed by the platform due to concerns over offensive language and the original upload has since been deleted. The dub includes the iconic line, "Don't you know who the fuck I am? I'm the Juggernaut, bitch!" The oldest known version still on the platform was reuploaded on October 7th, 2007, by YouTuber[2] Zachary Schneller, which has accumulated over 8.8 million views, 50,000 likes and 6,600 comments in just over 13 years (shown below). On September 1st, 2003, Newgrounds [1] user TheWeebl published the original video (mirror below). The post received more than 1.1 million views in less than 20 years. The earliest available reference to the phrase "If Blastoise was my dad, things would be different" was published on June 15th, 2008 on the website Paheal.com.[1] However, it was previously reported that the phrase comes from a 2008 4chan thread about "Pokedads." The thread is no longer available, but it reportedly contained the earliest known Advice Animal-variation of the meme. In the thread, a user post an advice dog style image with the head of a Blastoise, with the caption "Stick with me, kid / I'll protect you" (shown below). Can't Let You Do That (Star Fox) is a meme that's based off a line in StarFox 64 (also spawner of the infamous Barrel Roll), this line happened in the level "Fortuna" when the character Wolf O'Donnell leader of the Star Wolf team told Fox McCloud he could disarm the bomb at the base. Line at 1:59 The original song is Caipirinha which is a Brazilian style music written by a German singer Carinho in 2005 (shown below, left).[1] The soundtrack actually used in this video series is a sped up version of this orginal song. On the other hand, the dance is taken from Child President which is one of the 20th episode of the Japanese TV animation series of Azumanga Daioh, and it was first aired in 2002 (shown below, right).[2] The original scene is : Tomo is wagging her finger with one hand on her hip while chaffing Chiyo about she is childish.  In Episode 9 Season 15 of the animated television show The Simpsons, originally aired on February 22nd, 1998, the character Krusty the Clown insults his sidekick Sideshow Mel by saying "You, sir, are an idiot" (shown below). The “You, sir, are and idiot” variation of the expression is rumored to have originated on 4chan as a result of a typo. The earliest known mention of the phrase online was posted by Urban Dictionary[1] user LOLWUTANON by September 20th, 2008, who described the phrase as an “unfunny spam copypasta posted on /b/.”   The original "cha-cha" dance file was developed by Michael Girard and Robert Lurye. The source file (sk_baby.max) was released in Autumn 1996 as part of product sample source files included in Character Studio, a 3D character animation software by Kinetix/Autodesk. Ron Lussier, who was working for LucasArts at the time, tweaked the original file and shared it with coworkers via email, sparking the baby's internet travels: In late 1996, web developer John Woodell created a highly compressed animated GIF from the source movie, as part of a demo of the movie-to-GIF process, which further enabled the spread of the "Dancing Baby" across the Internet. The original song was released as a single in 2007 as a 30-second clip in Hungarian. It was eventually translated and released into over a dozen different languages including English, Spanish, French and Swedish, allowing it to mature into an international phenomenon. With the now infamous Gummy Bear Song, the video soon went viral on both YouTube[1] and MySpace[2]. Collectively, the English version of the song has 105 million views between the two main editions on YouTube and MySpace. The official Gummibär site[3] keeps an archive of all of the versions of the original, as well as other songs that have been recorded in the Gummy Bear style.  The video was produced by the Educational Section Anti-Piracy Committee (SPSA) and the Copyright Protection Fund in 1992 as a public service announcement to be shown in schools. The music video begins with two students Jenny and Corey playing a game in their library, and when Jenny has to leave, Corey says he will copy it so they can play at home. As Corey puts a blank disk into his computer, the Disk Protector, MC Double Def DP appears on the screen and begins to rap about how copyright infringement harms the video game and computer industries, causing games to be delayed or not even make it to production. After hearing the industry's perspective from the staff of America Online and the Software Publishers Association, the teenagers conclude they will instead buy the game they were playing. Before the video was uploaded online, it was mentioned by the New York Times[1] and the San Francisco Gate[2] in 1996 in news articles about the alarming trend of digital piracy, as well as incorporated into a National Science Foundation workshop on Ethics and Computing in 2000.[3] It was made available online for download as early as April 17th, 2003, when the internet culture blog NinjaCulture[4] published a nostalgic synopsis of the clip, breaking down the scenes for those who had never seen it. The line originally stems from a 2007 Cingular / AT&T commercial, wherein a preteen girl talks to her mother in SMS shorthand slang as she gets reprimanded for her excessive texting habits. The commercial was first aired in early 2007 and uploaded onto YouTube on April 19th, 2007. The song “You Are a Pirate” was introduced through the Icelandic children's TV show LazyTown in an episode titled “Rottenbeard,” which originally aired on October 4th, 2004 (shown below).[2] Do what you want 'cause a pirate is free, you are a pirate! Yar – har – fiddle-dee-dee, being a pirate is all right to be! Do what you want 'cause a pirate is free, you are a pirate! You are a pirate! (Yay!) We got us a map (a map!) to lead us to a hidden box, Thats all locked up with locks (with locks!) and buried deep away. We'll dig up the box (the box!), we know it's full of precious booty Burst open the locks, and then we'll say "HOORAY!" Yar – har – fiddle-dee-dee, If you love to sail the sea, you are a pirate! WEIGH ANCHOR! Yah – har – fiddle-dee-dee, being a pirate is all right to be! Do what you want 'cause a pirate is free, you are a pirate! Arr – yarr – ahoy and avast, dig in the dirt and you dig in it fast! Hang the black flag at the end of the mast! You are a pirate! HA HA HA (Yay!) We're sailing away (set sail!), adventure waits on every shore! We set sail and explore (ya-har!) and run and jump all day (Yay!) We float on our boat (our boat!) until its time to drop the anchor, Then hang up our coats (aye-aye!) until we sail again! Yar – har – fiddle-dee-dee, If you love to sail the sea you are a pirate!

Blue sky above and blue ocean below, you are a pirate! HA HA HA! You are a pirate! This video rose to popularity in the early 2000s, after having been posted on albinoblacksheep.com by Threebrain, the aforementioned comedic animator/songwriter. And it's popularity quickly rose to great heights until the year 2004, three years after its original posting, where it steadily declinedand petered out, with occasional interest still shown by longtime and new-found fans. Nearing the end of the Legend of Zelda CD-i game Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon, a cutscene takes place where Ganon shouts in anger at Zelda: "You dare bring light to my lair? You must die!" In another of the Legend of Zelda CD-i games, Link: The Faces of Evil, Ganon says the following during the cutscene preceding the final boss battle: "Join me, Link, and I will make your face the greatest in Koridai! Or else you will die!" In 2000, the self-published manga That's Why I Assault Ren was released.[1] After the main character's advances toward a child are rejected, the character turns to his cat and says, "A cat is fine too." The final two panels of the manga see the character removing his pants and a closeup of the cats eyes as their face drips with sweat. The cat's thoughts are captioned, "I'm done for…" (shown below). The prank articles originated on the Baidu Baike (Chinese Wikipedia-equivalent), documenting on fictional creatures whose names vaguely but obviously refer to Chinese profanities. Some people thought these articles were written in direct protest to the recent enforcement on strict keyword filtering in China, attempting to eliminate all profanity and access sensitive topics. These articles became popular and were widely discussed on Chinese forums and chat services. News sources also picked up the sensation, and many videos and mockumentaries were posted to Youtube. References could be found throughout Chinese websites. Variations were created, such as The Baidu 10 Legendary Weapons and The Baidu 10 Secret Delicacies.    At first, Auto-Tune was primarily used as a subtle way to cover the mistakes of a vocalist off their game; smoothly sliding the pitch to the correct note. Then in 1998, Cher's single Believe[1] came out. People had heard vocoders in the past, but this was different. Cher's voice snapped from one pitch to the next, as if her vocal chords had been quantized, leading some people to ask "what is that effect?" It was Auto-Tune, used excessively, to distort the tonal features of the voice. With the expense of the Antares Auto-Tune plugin[6] and the relative lack of social networking sites at the time, Auto-Tune remained something of a trade secret among many record producers who simply wanted to save time while working in the studio. But as online social communities, user-generated content, video tutorials, and open-source software proliferated in recent years, so did the availability, usage, and experimentation of Auto-Tune. The original creepypasta was posted via 4chan's /x/ (paranormal) board on March 28th, 2008. The first known instance of the copypasta was posted via pop singer Ashlee Simpson's official fan message board on October 23rd, 2004. Earlier that day, Simpson became involved in a scandal after she was seen lip-synching during her musical guest performance on Saturday Night Live, a late-night comedy program well-known for its traditionally live musical performances by famous singers and artists. In response to the mocking threads posted by Simpson's detractors and anti-fans, the singer replied to the thread by saying people should just get over the mishap and move on. Shortly afterwards, a reader known as "George_Zimmer"[1] on the message board responded to Simpson's post with the following message: Although it remains little known whether the copypasta had existed prior to the post on Ashlee Simpson's fan site, the unique style of anecdote became widespread through reposts on General Mayhem and 4chan amongst other places. The exact origins of this meme are unknown, but it is believed to have originated sometime around 2004. One such early example was posted on April 5th, 2004, in a thread on the My350Z[1] forums by user 12SecZ, who used the phrasal template alongside emoticons to show their reaction (seen below, left). Another early template setup using the phrase in a meme format included the caption "At first I was like, but then I lol'd." On May 27th, 2007, MyConfinedSpace[2] user Panzer posted one such example, receiving 24 votes and a 4.5 out of 5 rating in roughly 14 years (seen below, right). Seaking (Japanese: アズマオウ, Azumao) is a first-generation Water-type Pokémon originally introduced in the Red and Green editions of the game in 1996. The photoshopping phenomenon began in a thread posted to 4chan's /b/ (random) board[1] on April 22nd, 2007. The first post included a picture of Seaking ramming into the side of the Titanic, presumably causing it to sink. A passenger in a lifeboat is captioned with "Fuck yea! Seaking!" cheering on the oversized monster. The word "meh" is believed to have entered online usage through newsgroups on Usenet, with the earliest known instance found on soc.motss in a discussion about the TV sitcom series Melrose Place posted by John Dorrance on July 9th, 1992: Later that same year, it was quoted in a scene from The Simpsons episode "Homer's Triple Bypass" that aired on December 17th, 1992, by Lisa while lamenting about her generation's utter lack of sympthy towards others' misfortunes. According to Wikipedia, there are two theories behind the etymology of "meh": the more credible explanation of the two credits the animated TV series The Simpsons as the origin of its colloquial usage, while another theory suggests it is rooted in Yiddish language because of its similarity to the interjection "feh," which made its earliest known appearance in the 1936 classic film Yidl Mitn Fidl as the transliteration of the sound a goat makes. Pareidolia is an optical illusion which involves identifying shapes in objects where they are not present. The psychological phenomenon often takes the form of seeing faces in inanimate objects where subtle facial characteristics are perceived. Former science professor Carl Sagan speculated that pareidolia evolved in humans as a survival mechanism to easily recognize other human faces. The earliest known discussion of the phenomenon online was posted in the Straight Dope Forums[9] by user Irishman on June 1st, 2001, who asked for assistance in his investigation of the word's origin.  On October 14th, 1994, Quentin Tarantino's third film Pulp Fiction release in North America, becoming a massive hit and spawning many iconic scenes. One of the most well-known scenes sees Samuel L. Jackson's character Jules hold a gun to a man and shout, "English, motherfucker, do you speak it?" (shown below). It's unknown when the phrase was first used online or started being used in memes, but early examples can be found dating back to 2008, such as a demotivational poster featuring a version of the phrase and an image of Jules uploaded to Ebaum's World[1] on April 16th, 2008 (shown below).  YouTuber Jamie Holler first uploaded the scene from the movie Silent Night, Deadly Night Part 2 on Jun 7, 2006. A high quality version was then uploaded by YouTuber BrunoMe on June 14th, 2006. Within six years, the video received over 3.9 million views and 9,700 comments.  The first documented uses of the expression "party hard" predate Andrew W.K. by at least two decades. For example, the phrase appears in the lyrics of the song "Gonna Party" in the episode "Gunge the Great and Glorious" of the children puppet show Fraggle Rock that premiered in May 1985 (lyrics seen below).[1][2] Yeah, Papa, don't be late, Don't hang back when the party's starting. Mama, don't you wait, Come and you party hard. On October 29th, 2001, rock singer Andrew W.K released his song "Party Hard" as a single (music video shown below).[3] The song received positive reviews from critics and became Andrew W.K.'s first mainstream success, helping to popularize the phrase. When it's time to party, we will party hard Hey! In June 2002, Something Awful user Buffington Post[4] posted "Andrew_wk.gif," a two-frame GIF of Andrew W.K. captioned "PARTY HARD," with the text flashing yellow and red (shown below). On June 17th, 2008, Davenoon, a blogger for the political blog Lawyers, Guns, and Money[1], posted a short summary of Obama-skeptic comments that were made by another conservative blogger Neo-neocon. Then one of the readers Vanderleun misinterpreted Davenoon's snarky paraphrasing as a direct quote and left a comment criticizing its inaccuracy. In response, the author explained the practice of using "shorter" summary as a convention in the blogging community. Vanderleun then countered with the reply "I am aware of all internet traditions." Due to its conceited and self-defensive nature, his comment quickly caught on with other readers and spawned a lulzy stream of comments poking fun at the remark. In 2002, German students Björn Karnebogen and Gerd Jungbluth from Academy of Media Arts Cologne created the Historic Tale Construction Kit using Flash.[1] The application allowed users to create custom medieval tapestry designs by adding stylized text and images scanned from the 11th century Bayeux Tapestry. On May 15, 2003, the kit was made available to the public. The website was soon discovered on 4chan, where it was used to create image macros and reaction images. From an archived version of Wikiworld's 4chan entry: Olde English image macros of existing memes created using the Historical Tale Construction Kit. New medieval macros show up from time to time as new memes and in-jokes appear, though nothing has yet matched the original flood when /b/ first discovered them. Stolen by YTMND.     The phrase "cool story"[2] used as a sarcastic response to a narrative was first seen in the 2001 film Zoolander[5], where actor Owen Wilson's character Hansel tells a long winded story about a drug-induced hallucination. In response, a background character named Olaf yells out from across the room, "Cool story, Hansel" while laughing. "Cool Story, Bro" began on 4chan's /v/ (video games) board[8], used as a response to posts containing personal or lengthy stories as early as July 18th, 2008[9] in a thread for sad moments in a person's gaming life. Image macros followed, initially paired with a panel from Marvel Comics' The Incredible Hercules #122.[6] The issue was inked by Clayton Henry and Salvador Espin and published on October 29th, 2008, showing Hercules during a flashback right before he finds out his friend Queen Hippolyta had been killed.[7] During Operation Porn Day on May 20th, 2009, one of the many Operation YouTube raids, 4chan users flooded the video-sharing site with x-rated clips under the guise of popular adolescent entertainment like Lazy Town, Jonas Brothers and Miley Cyrus. The next day, the BBC[1] reported on the attack and quoted the now-infamous YouTube comment in one of the videos seen at :37 during the on-air segment: In one video titled Jonas Brother Live On Stage, a user posted a comment saying: "I'm 12 years old and what is this?" The duckroll originated in the mid-2000s on 4chan as a response to a world filter moot had put on the site. In an interview with TechCrunch, he explained that he set up a filter to change the word "egg" to "duck." Whenever someone posted the word "eggroll," it was changed to "duckroll." After seeing the filter in action, users started posting links to an image of a duck with wooden wheels as a bait and switch, advertising the link to be to an exciting post. While no exact date has been pinpointed, Lurkmore Wiki says the phenomenon began in mid-November 2006[1], but the earliest archived 4chan thread with a duckroll appeared on December 12th, 2006.[2] Cuil Theory is derived from a post on Reddit in Fall 2008. [1] At the time, the search engine Cuil had been in the news for not attaining its position as the 'Google-Killer'. Discussions on the internet about the quantum search results garnered from using Cuil were a staple of most social sites. One such discussion created a small mathematical and philosophical theory about how the search capabilities within Cuil could be used to represent a framework for analyzing small scale variations from consensus reality. Due to Cuil's relatively inaccurate level of search quality compared to Google, Reddit users came to agree upon the "Cuil" becoming a new hypothetical unit of measurement representing one layer of abstraction from true reality. Reddit user RedDyeNumber4 presented a full list of hamburger-based scenarios in the epic thread. To quote from the wikidot page of the Cuil Theory site. The popular conception of the Cuil is heavily informed by the thought of Immanuel Kant. In The Critique of Pure Reason, Kant lays out what he describes as his "Copernican Revolution". He insists that the world we experience is informed by the world as it truly is and the restraints of our own consciousness. Thus, we can never really know what's happening in the world as it truly exists except that it has a role in shaping the world that we experience. Kant believed this realization was similar to realizing that the sun, not earth, is at the center of the solar system. Cuil Philosophers believe that as the study of Cuil advances, we'll approach an understanding that will show that the Cuil level of a situation is equivalent to the number of sets of limits of consciousness are being superimposed over the world as it really is. For example, a 2 Cuil abstraction occurs when the world as it truly is informs a world of experience in conjunction with one set of consciousness constraints, and that the world of experience would then inform a second world of experience in conjunction with a second set of consciousness constraints. More in-depth information about this philosophy can be found here. The Geocities page[1] for Asianprince213 was created in 1999, featuring several glamour portraits of a mustached Asian man, whose style of fashion seemed heavily influenced by American rock musicians like Prince and Little Richard, accompanied by self-introductory text: It has become a widely-used phrase amongst players of many RTS computer games such as StarCraft and Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2. In particular, the screenshot which is believed to be the origin of the phrase as a fad was taken from StarCraft and posted on the SomethingAwful forums. According to the Internet Timeline on Dipity, this meme is believed to have originated on the SomethingAwful forums in 2003 when a screenshot of a game of StarCraft was posted on the Games forum by usrer 1337h4x. Transcript of in-game chat: im in ur base, killing ur d00ds The formula is "im in ur X (verb)ing (ur/my) Y". In late 2006, stick-figure comics depicting a character who is bound to fail at everything he does started to appear on 4chan. The Character soon became known as "Epic Fail Guy." On September 30th, 2006, a thread was posted in which "Epic Fail Guy" found a Guy Fawkes mask similar to the one in the movie V for Vendetta in a garbage bin. From this point onward, many more Epic Fail Guy threads would appear on /b/ depicting him both with and without the Guy Fawkes mask. Exactly why EFG wore the mask is unknown, but Anonymous's preference for the mask seems to have grown directly from this meme. As time went on, Epic Fail Guy began to appear almost exclusively wearing the mask.   The photograph of four IGN reporters (Matt Casamassina, Craig Harris, Chadd Chamers, Peer Schneider) looking rather disinterested was originally taken during Nintendo's conference at E3 2003 Expo[1], where Nintendo's CEO introduced "Pacman vs." for GameCube. The photograph of the same men looking excited was taken one year later during Nintendo's conference at E3 2004 Expo[2], where they announced the release of a new Zelda title. Originally posted on IGN board[3], these two photographs were incorporated into the Yonkoma comic-strip format on /ghard/ (Game Hardware) board in 2channel[4], where it was dubbed "Gaijin 4koma" or "4-frame foreigners" in Japanese. According to the archived threads, the comic strips became popular on 2channel as early as in June 2004.  Three Wolf Moon t-shirt was designed by Bulgarian artist Antonia Neschev[1] and produced by The Mountain, a New Hampshire-based company that offers a variety of nature-oriented graphic tees. The Amazon product page[2] received its first ironic review on November 10th, 2008, when reviewer named Brian Govern[13] hailed the T-shirt as a magical product: Excerpt:  According to an article on cardhouse.com[1] the phrase “Every time you masturbate, God Kills a Kitten” first appeared in print in BarFly magazine[2] as the image below, prior to the year 2000. The most notable character featuring gumball eyes is the Sonic the Hedgehog version. The original version of the Sonic treat was released to be in partnership with the planned 1996 Sonic game Sonic X-treme which was officially cancelled in 1997.[2] There have since been several iterations of the ice creams, including a regular Sonic the Hedgehog-branded version. While the Bars in the 90's were known to have mismatched eyes, Sonic fans were first known to record mismatched eyes online at some point around 2009. A blogger at Sonic Gear cataloged the different versions available at that time, noting that the ice cream bars rarely looked much like the actual Sonic character, and often looked "scary."  On August 3rd, 2001, the newsletter NTK[3] released a video of Ballmer jumping on stage and screaming at the audience at Microsoft's 25th Anniversary event in September of 2000 (shown below, left). At an unknown date, another video featuring Ballmer was added to a download page on NTK titled “NTK’s CEO of The Dance Page”[5], which featured Ballmer chanting the word “developers” repeatedly at conference (shown below, right).  The single-pane comic was originally published as part of the webcomic series The Parking Lot Is Full[1] illustrated by artist Jack McLaren and written by Pat Spacek. Described as crudely drawn with a touch of macabre, the webcomic gained a sizable cult following through its run from 1993 to 2002. The comic was first published on March 6th 1998 and portrayed an abusive father wearing a mask of the Disney character Goofy intruding upon his son's room with a belt in his hand. On October 13th, 2007, a 2channel anonymous user attempted to do Shift_JIS art portraying the Touhou protagonists Reimu Hakurei and Marisa Kirisame (shown below).[1] However, the attempt didn't turn out succesfully, resulting in the infamous giant heads. While it was perceived as a failure by some, others embraced the attempt with humor. The faces eventually became a running injoke of the community, resulting in the Shift_JIS art being redrawn as well (shown above). "Ridin'" was released by Chamillionaire on December 13th, 2005.[1] The song is about how police hassle him in his car trying to find illegal materials but fail (shown below). The earliest origin of "playing dead" can be traced back to Crayon Shin-Chan[1], a popular 90s Japanese manga by Yoshito Usui. In the series, Shin-chan (the main character) often plays a prank on his mother by pretending to be dead on the floor as she returns home from running errands. The manga became an international hit throughout the late nineties and in early 2003, group photos of S. Korean school pupils "playing dead" began to emerge on the web[2]. Subsequently, the prank became a national meme throughout all demographics, from kindergartners and high school students to all sorts of people at work and housewives at home.  September 2003… several posters about a missing frog are found in Seattle. "Terry" seemed quite determined to get a frog back. A Hopkin Green Frog. One year later the website lostfrog.org surfaced. It gained attention quickly, and the popular community forum Metafilter had two threads about Hopkin and the search to find him. Hypnotoad originally appeared on Futurama in the episode "The Day the Earth Stood Stupid," which aired on February 18th, 2001.[1] In the clip, Hypnotoad uses his hypnotic abilities to herd a flock of sheep and impress the judges of a dog show, only to then use his hypnosis to win and force the crowd to clap for him in robotic unison (seen below). The sound Hypnotoad makes while using his power is a recording of a turbine engine played backward.[3] The most commonly used image of Hypnotoad found in memes comes from the parody show Everybody Loves Hypnotoad, a spoof of Everybody Loves Raymond, where Hypnotoad is seen staring into the camera while seated atop a lily pad as he hypnotizes viewers into enjoying his program (shown below).[2] It is unknown exactly who first posted a meme featuring Hypnotoad, but most of the oldest examples date back to the late 2000s in the form of a basic Advice-Animals-like image macro with the character appearing alongside the caption "All glory to the Hypnotoad." On May 11th, 2006, the phrase was added to Urban Dictionary by user TopTomCat.[3] The original scene comes from the last part of episode eight, season one, in the Death Note anime series titled "Glare."[1] In the scene, the villain protagonist Light Yagami, or Kira, grabs a potato chip out of the bag and takes a dramatic pause to utter, "I'll take a potato chip … AND EAT IT!" before taking a bite. Played out in slow motion, the potato chip shatters into sparkling dust (seen below). On September 16th, 1995, the episode of Freakazoid entitled "Candlejack" aired in the United States.[1] In the episode, children tell ghost stories at summer camp. One tells the story of "Candle Jack," a Bogeyman-like monster that kidnaps children who say his name (clip below). The earliest known instance of the original comic strip was uploaded to YouTube[9] on December 23rd, 2006 with no mention of its creator. The art is commonly attributed to Chris VanGompel's now-defunct webcomic Hockey Zombie[1], which featured a comic titled "The Singing Shark"[7] on February 20th, 2007, in celebration of Discovery Channel's Shark Week[8], an annual programming event celebrating various species of sharks.  In June 1991, the beat 'em up platformer game Battletoads was released for the NES, in which players battle enemies while controlling anthropomorphic frog characters (shown below). A number of sequels were subsequently produced over the next several years, including Battlemaniacs, Battletoads & Double Dragon and Super Battle Toads Arcade. According to Encyclopedia Dramatica,[6] 4chan users began prank calling various GameStop locations and asking to preoder Battletoads games in mid-November 2007. A German news network (Called Focus TV) got the rights to this clip and made up a backstory. The backstory goes a little like this: a father secretly recording his angry, ADHD son playing his favourite violent video game. You can find a translated version of an article about it posted in November 2006 here. In it, there is a comparison made between him and a school shooting that took place in Emsdetten at that time. By 2009, Focus Online, the Internet version of Focus, posted a video where the Angry German Kid made an appearance among other media. Here, he is presented as one of the most successful Youtube videos posted in German. Then someone would say he's speaking German and no one would be surprised. Because he was yelling a foreign language, it looked awfully legit. It turned out it was staged, which became apparent when you see his other videos where he is calling himself a "gangster". Actually, according to this AGK takes a lot of flak because of his videos. He says he gets beaten up and made fun of. Moreover, Leopold as written a note on his blog clearly explaining that it was a staged impression (translated): The earliest known reference to division by zero can be found in a YTMND site[15] titled “1/0 !!!!!!!!!!!!” uploaded on October 3rd, 2005, which featured an artist's illustration of a black hole. However, according to Encyclopedia Dramatica[16], the phrase is said to have originated on 4chan's /b/ (random) board, with its earliest dating to December 8th, 2006. In the thread, posters were sharing their chat logs with ChaCha.com search engine, one of which illustrated an Anonymous poster asking “do you know what happens when you divide by 0? things go BOOM so I hear." The question unacknowledged by the ChaCha representative. On December 16th, 1998, Comedy Central aired the South Park episode "Gnomes."[1] In the episode, the characters report that they are missing underpants and discover a society of tiny, magical gnomes who are stealing their undergarments for a supposed profit. When asked about their plan, the gnomes describe their method as, "Step 1: Collect underpants. Step 2." Step 3: Profit." The lack of step two indicates that they do not have an actual plan for monetizing their underpants collection (clip below). In an article on The Daily Globe,[5] writer Justine Wettschreck stated that The Game originated in "the early 1990s" somewhere in Australia or England. An article by The Canadian Press[6] reported that The Game may have been created by London resident Jamie Miller, who claims to have started The Game in 1996. On August 10th, 2002, the earliest known reference to The Game online was featured in a post[4] published by blogger Paul Taylor titled "The Game (I lost!)", who claimed to have discovered it only six months prior. On February 10th, 1965, the Tom and Jerry cartoon short Bad Day at cat Rock was released.[1] In the short, Tom attempts to catch the mouse Jerry, and the pair make their way onto a construction site, where they search for each other from behind wooden beams. During the scene, Tom makes the expression (shown below). In the mid-00s, anonymous users on the 4chan imageboard /b/ SPAMed threads with the image as a shitpost. These posts would reportedly elicit the response, "If I see the fucking cat one more time…" On May 12th, 2004, American broadcast network NBC merged with Vivendi Universal Entertainment under the newly created company NBC Universal, allowing NBC producers to access and roll footage from a variety of Universal productions without having to pay the license fee, including clips from CBS action TV series Walker, Texas Ranger starring Chuck Norris[1]. On May 13th, NBC late-night talk show host Conan O'Brien introduced a new segment titled "Walker Texas Ranger Lever,"[8] in which the comedian would pull on the stage prop to cue up a random and comically over-the-top scene from the daytime action TV series[9] (shown below). The subsequent episodes of Late Night with Conan O'Brien continued to feature new renditions of the recurring sketch, though it went on a hiatus in late summer that year, shortly after Chuck Norris appeared on the show as a guest and fired a prop gun at the host. In March 2005, shortly after the box office release of American family comedy film The Pacifier starring Vin Diesel as a Navy SEAL-turned-babysitter, Something Awful forum member ScootsMagoo started a thread titled “Post Your Vin Diesel Facts.” Heavily driven by the laughable premise of the film, many members of the forum chimed in on the thread with a slew of tongue-in-cheek factoids, glorifying the actor as the archetype of a modern-day tough guy. Some of the more notable instances included:  The original comic pane was first published in a 1984 issue of The Amazing Spider-man, appearing in a promotional page asking for the readers' feedback on advertisements: There are conflicting reports regarding the birth of "how do I shot web?", but numerous reference materials point to Something Awful (SA) forums's "goons-only" gaming server as the earliest known site of origin. According to firsthand accounts, it was originally quoted during a round of Natural Selection[1] (2002), wherein the alien enemies' primary choice of weapon was shooting spider webs. Out of sheer frustration, a newbie player repeatedly asked "how do i shot web?" in imperfect English, which presumably meant "How Do I Shoot Web." The earliest Google sighting[2] of the phrase was reported as early as in February 2003. On September 14th, 2005, DC Comics released the comic book All Star Batman and Robin, the Boy Wonder by fan-favorite writer and artist Frank Miller and Jim Lee, respectively.[2] In the comic, Batman captures Robin, immediately following the death of the boy's parents. Once Robin realizes what happened, the two have the following exchange (shown below): According to Ruakuu's Blog[3], the origin of Caramelldansen was the flash loop composed by Sven from Sweden in the first half of 2006, and it was originally posted on his personal website.[4] Its visual source is an animated gif taken from an opening movie of the Japanese adult visual novel Popotan, released in 2002.[5] The animated GIF of the dance was entitled "Popotan dance" and had existed on the web since before 2005. In the interview by Ruakuu's blog, Sven said he found this animated gif on /gif/ in 4chan. The song in the original flash loop is a sped-up version of the "Caramelldansen" composed by DJ Speedycake.[6] He released this remix on 4chan around the same time Sven was combining the Popotan dance animated gif with several dance tunes. In the beginning of The Legend of Zelda, the player's character Link acquires his first weapon by entering a cave and speaking to an elderly man, who offers a wooden sword by saying “It’s dangerous to go alone! Take this” (shown below). On May 17th, 2004, an YTMND page titled "It's Dangerous to go Alone!" was created, containing a tiled image of the scene from The Legend of Zelda accompanied by a repeating sound effect from the game.   The man in the picture has been identified as southern rapper Rich Boy (real name: Maurice Richards), who was co-hosting MTV's music variety program TRL with rapper Ne-Yo in New York's Times Square on March 13, 2007. Contrary to the widespread rumors, the rapper depicted in the image is NOT Kanye West. According to unconfirmed internet legends, the original image macro of Rich Boy was posted on 4chan when a desperate Anon decided to start a rump thread on /b/. A fellow anon responded to the thread with a found photograph of rapper Rich Boy, slapping the words Dat Ass on the image for good measure. It is unknown when finger-tenting first began. An early example can be seen in the 1976 anime series All-Star Combattler V[7] (shown below). On October 11th, 1995, Episode 2 of the anime series "Neon Genesis Evangelion" aired on Japanese television. In the episode, the character Gendo performs the Ambassador's Pose while discussing current events with the Human Instrumentality Committee (shown below). According to various accounts, "picture unrelated" began on 4chan's /r/ (request) board, where users can submit and fulfill various requests for particular links or downloadable files. While there are few archival resources available for early years of 4chan, one of the first archived instances of "picture unrelated" images can be found in a personal blog entry by Amy posted on September 12th, 2006. The image is based on an original artwork titled Rooster Zebra Contemplating Grilled-Cheese Sandwich (2004) by San Diego-based painter Matt Forderer: On March 10th, 2000, Microsoft unveiled its first home video game console Xbox at the Game Developers Conference. While the technology of the console was widely perceived as impressive, the system quickly gained notoriety in online gaming communities for its large, bulky appearance in contrast to the relatively slim Sony PlayStation 2 and compact Nintendo GameCube. In the months leading up to its official release in November 2001, Penny Arcade published at least two comic strips mocking the awkward size of the console and controllers. The titular creatures are known as "Spongmonkeys" and the term originates on b3ta.com.[1] Their name comes from the words "spong" and "monkey". The video depicts the creatures singing and playing the guitar. "Spong" is a popular term from b3ta that means "The practice of adding large staring eyes with small pupils to an image". The practice of Sponging was already popular amongst b3ta users prior to the creation of the video. Joel Veitch, is a web animator and singer-songwriter created the original video, featuring two Spongmonkeys singing a song titled "We Like the Moon,"[2] and posted it January 24th, 2003.[3] It was uploaded to the Rathergood YouTube account on November 3rd, 2007, where it was viewed over 1.1 million times (shown below).  On June 7th, 2005, blogger Jeremy Winterson[1] compiled a set of photos[3] he took of a Chinese bootleg DVD of Star Wars Episode III: The Revenge of the Sith[2], comically mistranslated as Star War The Backstroke of the West. The movie included many Engrish translations including the "Jedi Council" becoming "The Presbyterian Church" and "the force" becoming "the wish power." During the pivotal scene where Darth Vader learns of his wife's death, his famous line "NOOO" was translated as “Do not want" in the subtitle. On December 6th, 2007, 4chan received a large influx of traffic after a post titled "Top 100 Funny Pics From 4chan (NSFW)" reached the front page of the social news aggregator Digg.[1] The same day, moot re-skinned 4chan to appear more "web 2.0" as a possible response to the incoming Digg traffic. 4chan users responded to the influx of new members by posting images that read "this image requires a 4chan gold account".[2] "On January 1, 2008, 4chan will introduce user accounts. Each user will have a unique name, and will be required to supply a working email address. Also, in an attempt to keep bandwidth at a manageable level, users will be limited to 15 posts per day unless they purchase a 4chan Gold account to allow unlimited posting." So, have you guys preordered your accounts yet?" In 2006, Yahoo! Answers[1] user kavya posted the question "how is babby formed? How girl get pragnent?" The most famous answer is also infamous for misspelling and grammatical errors. It reads: "They need to do way instain mother> who kill thier babbys, becuse these babby cant fright back? It was on the news this mroing a mother in ar who had kill her three kids, they are taking the three babby back to new york too lady to rest. my pary are with the father who lost his chrilden ; i am truley sorry for your lots" The original post (shown below), however, was not archived and only exists through reposts. On September 24th, 1995, The Simpsons aired the episode "Radioactive Man".[1] In the episode, a Hollywood production studio films a "Radioactive Man" movie in Springfield. Action movie star Rainier Wolfcastle (voiced by Harry Shearer), a parody of Arnold Schwarzeneggar, lands the titular role, which requires him to perform a stunt with real acid. Before shooting, the director explains that Radioactive Man's sidekick Fallout Boy will rescue the superhero before the acid reaches him and to wear protective goggles. When shooting begins, it's clear that Fallout Boy isn't coming, so Wolfcastle slips on a pair of goggles. As he's being carried away by a river of acid, he yells, "My eyes! The goggles do nothing!" (shown below).  In January of 2005, the Kansas Board of Education was considering making changes to its science standards. The board proposed that "intelligent design", the claim that a conscious being created the universe, be presented as an alternative explanation to evolution and that teachers should be required to state that evolution is a theory and not a fact. Bobby Henderson, a 25-year old Oregon University student at the time, noticed that the Board only specified "Intelligent Designer" and not the specific name of any one known deity. This inspired Bobby to protest the proposal by creating the fictional deity named "Flying Spaghetti Monster." In May of 2005, Henderson posted an open letter to the Kansas school board on his website[2], in which he addressed his opinion that intelligent design was no more valid than the belief that a Flying Spaghetti Monster created the universe. In February 2007, a teenage video bloger only known as "Lil J" released a video under the youtube account "LILSHOWSTOPPA". In this video, she is clearly irate and is intent on sending a message to "haters", and to show that she aint scared. Interestingly enough, this is the only video ever uploaded to the account, making it appear that the video isn't even a response to anything; but instead is an announcement of her arrival.  Falcon Punch is a special move performed by Captain Falcon in the Nintendo game series Super Smash Bros. The move was originally created for Super Smash Bros. on the Nintendo 64 and didn't exist in Captain Falcon's original game series F-Zero. Captain Falcon summons the power of a falcon to punch his enemies whilst shouting "Falcon Punch!" Ha! Ha! Guy (or Quaker Guy) first appeared in a 19th century newspaper advertising "Forbes' Insoluble Dry Plates. The advertisements had a cheery Anglican or Quaker laughing about using a insoluble dry plate. The man himself looks like the man below, depicted in the painting "Midland Man 1874." In 2008, the painting was sold on shopgoodwill.com for $5.  The exact origin of fgsfds is unknown, but appears to have begun around June 2005 based on a Google Trends inquiry.[1] According to Encyclopedia Dramatica[2] and a 2006 post by user Reichu to Eva Geeks forum,[3] the phrase came about when a 4chan user replied to a post with "fgsfds," after which another user named Oryan quickly photoshopped it onto an image of Harald Schmidt, a German talk show host, pointing upward (shown below). The video clip was uploaded by YouTuber KidCorduroy on January 17th, 2008. Aside from the fact that weatherman's first name is "Arthur," the original air date of the news report or the name of news station still remain unknown. The clip shows Arthur explaining that "pretty much everywhere, it's gonna be hot," shortly before he breaks into an uncontrollable fit of laughter. YouTuber FlyingPandaSquirrel2 offered a plausible explanation in the comments, which posited that it was a moment of in-joke among the newscasters, who may had been required to wear the uniform jackets during broadcast despite such hot weather. Similar explanations can be seen in a number of duplicate uploads in the comments section. As of June 2012, the original video clip has been viewed more than 5.5 million times. The oldest YouTube video which seems to be the original is "Crazy Frog Bros" posted by user nalobi[1] the 15th of July 2006. While the boy in the black tanktop appears to be acting tough, his redshirt amigo partakes in dance moves that make even the best ravers look boring in comparison. Serious skills indeed. They produced 4 takes of the video (!) but the first is considered "the original" (and funniest). The video was heavily shared & re-uploaded. Numerous copies of the video have been taken down, making an assessment of the views to be practically impossible.  Unknown currently  The original source of the comic strip is unknown, but the image macro series was first posted to 4chan in 2008. An Encyclopedia Dramatica article about the comic was first published on November 28th, 2008. Since then, the comic has spread to other forums, such as Bodybuilding.com[1], and the phrase "I am disappoint" has found common usage in internet slang (template shown below). The term originates from the memorial MySpace page of Mitchell Henderson, who committed suicide on April 20th, 2006. The term comes from a spelling error from one of the comments posted on the memorial page. "He was such an hero, to take it all away. We miss him so, That you should know, And we honor him this day. He was an hero, to take that shot, to leave us all behind. God do we wish we could take it back, And now he's on our minds. Mitchell was an hero, to leave us feeling like this, Our minds are rubber, our joints don't work, Our tears fall into abyss. He was an hero, to take that shot, In life it wasn't his task, He shouldn't have had to go that way, before an decade'd past. Now he sits there in my heart, this hero of mine, Always there to make me smile, Make me feel just fine. He had courage,that boy did, courage in his heart. To take that shot, To end his pain, To tear us all apart. But in the end, he died in courage. Lacking, nevermore, He died a hero, Mitchell did, And we'll love him forevermore. We love you like an brother. We miss you so much. We will always love you, kid. Rest In Peace Mitch. ~Lila" The video was first uploaded to World of Warcraft fansite Warcraft Movies[13] on May 11th, 2005. The guild PalsForLife[1] posted the video to the official World of Warcraft forums[2] asking for constructive criticism on their gameplay. The video showed the guild intensely discussing battle strategies, preparing to enter a dangerous zone in the game known as the about to enter the Rookery[14] in the Upper Blackrock Spire, known for its large quantity of dragonspawn. Suddenly, a paladin in the group named Leeroy Jenkins, who appeared to have missed the discussion, yells out "alright, lets do this!" before charging into the area, killing everyone in the party (mirror below). As of May 2012, the first upload to Warcraft Movies has only 1,766,568 views. The original post on the World of Warcraft forums was edited several times to add in additional download links to the video, showing that it was shared several places before being uploading to a major video sharing site.  "The World" first appeared on chapter 248 of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, released on December 16th, 1991, where Dio Brando uses its powers to move Polnareff through stairs.[1][8] In 1993 and 1994, a series of OVAs adapting the last part of Stardust Crussaders was released, with the last one released on November 18th, 1994. On the episode, Dio Brando pronunces "The World" as "Za Warudo" (shown below, left and right). In 1998, an arcade fighting videogame featuring JoJo characters was released on Japan. Dio's super move included him stopping the time, throwing two sets of knives, and falling with a steamroller while hitting and destroying it.  On December 29th, 2008, YouTuber[2] k8lync uploaded a recording of a preview of the upcoming episode of It's Me or the Dog, focusing particularly on a clip of Stains staring at a plate of cupcakes and laughing (shown below). The video gained over 60,000 views in 12 years and is the earliest video of the clip, pre-dating the original air date. On January 17th, 2009, Season 1 Episode 13 of the U.S. version of It's Me or the Dog,[6] a show in which a trainer helps correct bad behavior in dogs, aired on Animal Planet. At one point in the episode, the trainer holds a plate of cupcakes in front of Stains' nose in order to show that she's improved his restraint. The dog stares at the cupcakes hypnotically for an extended period of time but does not eat them. On February 18th, the official Animal Planet YouTube[1] channel uploaded the scene, garnering over 2.4 million views in 12 years (shown below). On January 23rd, 2009, YouTuber[3] agentmedia uploaded a video titled, "dramatic cupcake dog" combining the clip of Stains staring at cupcakes with the audio from the Dramatic Chipmunk video, garnering over 1 million views in 12 years (shown below). The video helped inspire numerous edits, which were uploaded to YouTube over the course of the next year. In 1970, Japanese roboticist Masahiro Mori hypothesized that human observers respond positively and empathetically to robots as their human-like appearance increases, though only up until a point after which the strange familiarity begins to evoke revulsion, a phenomenon that Mori referred to as the “uncanny valley” (shown below). The origin of the meme is unknown. On January 29th, 2009, an anonymous 4chan user posted the earliest mention of the phrase "newfags can't triforce" in the /a/ imageboard. They wrote, "/b/ moves too fast. Even with that time between posts (flood detection) is still moves too fast. Make a new thread, wait 60 seconds, reload, 404. Then only thing you'll see on /b/ are; hook up threads, boxxy threads, newfags can't triforce threads and report threads."[1] The Burger King mascot was first introduced on a sign at the original Burger King restaurant in Miami, Florida in 1955. An animated King character was used in a series of commercials in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The animated King was replaced by the red-bearded "Marvelous Magical Burger King" in the late 1970s which paralleled McDonald's "Ronald McDonald" ad campaign. On January 22nd, 2004, Burger King announced that the Miami-based advertising firm Crispin Portor + Bogusky (CP+B) will be developing ad campaigns for the chain restaurant. Later that year, the company launched a campaign with a new Burger King character called “the King." According to the news site Slate[3], the mascot's oversized head was inspired by a helium tank fixture found on eBay by an agency employee who was looking for inspirations. The first commercial “Wake Up With the King” aired in October 2004, featuring a man waking up in bed next to the King offering him a breakfast sandwich. After a series of commercials with similar scenarios were aired, the mascot became referred to as the “Creepy King” with one of the earliest references posted on the conservative politics board Free Republic[5] on October 25th, 2005. The creepy persona was embraced by Burger King and it became a main trait of the King in the promotional XBOX game “Sneak King."    On December 3rd, 1992, the Fox network aired the Simpsons episode "Lisa's First Word."[1] In the episode, the character Homer Simpson builds his son Bart (voiced by Dan Castellaneta and Nancy Cartwright, respectively) a new bed in the approximate likeness of Bart's favorite clown Krusty the Clown. The design terrifies Bart, who later in the episode can be seen cradling himself and muttering "can't sleep, clown will eat me" (shown below). Ill Mitch, born in Soviet Russia, came to America with an insatiable appetite to rap, box, and ride skateboard. His addictive rhymes and deep lyrics ("I have two sides – one happy, one anger") earned him billions of fans across the world. He has also released a number of videos to connect with his fans: Official website In 2002, Jack Chick released the comic "Hi There" on JackChick.com, in which a soldier complains about his wife while holding up a peanut butter sandwich she made for him, saying "She knows I hate peanut butter" (shown below). In the panel, his helmet can be confused with a chef hat, which would give him the nickname of "sandwich chef" when the scene became an exploitable. A panel of the comic is rumored to have been posted on the Something Awful Forums, where an edited version was created in captioned with "This is an ass sandwich / it is made of ass and poo" (shown below). On March 7th, 2001, DarkMateria[5] uploaded a song titled “The Picard Song” to his personal website[4], featuring a remix compilation of memorable quotes by Captain Jean Luc-Picard (played by Patrick Stewart) from the television series Star Trek: The Next Generation. The song remained relatively obscure until it was used in a YTMND[3] page created by user ShittyMcShit on April 25th, 2004. Within eight years, the page received over 3.8 million views, 1,800 comments and a 4.55/5 star rating. Although this expression predates the internet, many an internet know-it-all has used the phrase in chat, email, and on message boards. Here is an excerpt from a rather passionate exchange between a Windows user and a Linux user in 2001: The now famous picture of Nicolas Cage's hair photoshopped into a bird is rumored to have originated on 4chan, although no archived thread exists to confirm this. This image macro places the clear insistence of logic on top of an image with a rather high WTF quotient. The dog photo was known on 4chan's /b/ (random) board as "Staredog" as early as August 2007.[1] Though its original post date is unknown, the watermark in the upper left corner of the original image is attributed to the Swedish auction site Blocket.se.[2] The image macro was created some time in early January 2009 on /b/, with the earliest instances using black Arial text instead of the conventional white Impact font. While the original thread was never archived, it apparently inspired the creation of Memegenerator[5], according to an AMA-style 4chan thread posted in January 2011 by an Anonymous user claiming to be the founder of Memegenerator. On January 13th, 2003, KRON-TV Channel 4[1] in San Francisco Bay Area covered a story about strange noise problems in the streets of Oakland, California, caused by a piece of metal added onto cars’ exhaust pipes. Among the local residents interviewed were Lynell Griffin, who who identified himself as “Bubb Rubb," and his associate "Lil Sis," who also defended the use of whistle tips.  The video was uploaded seven years later on March 26th, 2005 by Brandon[1] after his girlfriend Aysha suggested that he share the video on YouTube. Macroherpetophiles is the correct term for those with the odd fetish of large lizards. It started from the book Crooked Little Vein by Warren Ellis (a review of the book can be found here. Warren, quite embarrassed by his story, had requested that his story be ignored and that "Godzilla Bukkake" would not grow in popularity. Unforunately for him, there was a very large spike of interest in March of 2009. After that however, it popularity had decreased, although the images are still to this day being created. In September of 2007, on the day before the airing of the final episode of the School Days anime in Japan, a 16-year-old girl killed her father with an axe in Kyoto.[1] Due to an extremely similar scene present in the episode and to avoid relation to the axe murder, TV Kanagawa replaced the episode with a half-hour of unrelated scenery while "Air on a G String" played in the background. Included in the footage was a Norwegian ferry (shown below). Among the shock and rage expressed among fans, a 4chan user commented "Nice Boat," referring to the Norwegian ferry shown in the replacement footage (shown below). The original photo was taken by Alex Stram on January 3, 2005 at the Che Cafe in San Diego, California during a Righteous Jams concert, using a Canon PowerShot SD10. According to a blog entry by Herby Hönigsperger: Soon, the image of Sam from Alex's photostream was appearing on message boards around the web, photoshopping "mosh girl" into various scenes; some of them hilarious, some of them offensive. All types were cataloged on Moshzilla.com On February 10th, 2005, Moshzilla.com removed all photos of Sam at request from "Little Sam" and her parents. Urban Dictionary entry for Moshzilla, created on June 26th, 2005: Here.  "Feels Good Man" comes from a comic series titled Boy's Club by San Francisco based artist Matt Furie, and has been published by Buenaventura Press since 2006.[1] The comic stars four monsters, Pepe the frog, Brett, Andy, and Landwolf; mostly in situations where they are expelling bodily fluids and using popular 90's catchphrases like "Got Milk?" and "As if!" Furie first posted his comics to his MySpace [3] blog in a long series of posts surrounding the Boy's Club characters. However, Furie's MySpace account is no longer accessible as it has been voluntarily deleted. Furie has stated in an interview with Know Your Meme that he remembers uploading the comics in late 2005. In early 2008, a user on 4Chan's /b/ board decided to upload a scan of one page from the comic, involving Pepe pulling his pants all the way down to his ankles to urinate, leaving his buttocks exposed. Furie recollects the story behind this specific comic: My cousin, when we were kids we went to elementary school together and we would go into the public restroom and he would pull his pants all the way down to go pee and I thought it was hilarious. Then he did it in public but you know we were little kids. So then I just thought it would be funny… I don't even know what age the comic book characters are but they're anywhere between teenager and twenty-something I guess. Sometime in 2006, rumors began to spread on 4chan's /b/ (random) board that Habbo's social moderators were prone to racial profiling against dark-skinned avatar users and abusing their ban powers to keep them out of the site. On July 6th, 2006, a group of 4chan users calling themselves /b/lockers decided to raid Habbo Hotel by forming blockades around the entrances of popular hangouts, exploiting a technical issue that wouldn't allow avatars to walk through each other when entering and exiting premises. As a result, the human blockade quickly became a source of frustration to the newcomer.  The site first appeared on the now defunct free site host xoom.com and was one of the first widely circulated Internet memes, up there with Hamster Dance and Dancing Baby. The original text of Cagri's website said: "I like music , I have many many music enstrumans my home I can play I like sport , swiming , basketball , tenis , volayball , walk ………" and "My profession jurnalist , music and sport teacher , I make psycolojy doctora I like to take foto-camera (amimals , towns , nice nude models and peoples)….." A variant of his page, hosted on http://istanbul.tc/mahir/mahir/ made the addition: Very Nice! On May 25th, 2008, a video titled "Why every guy should buy their girlfriend Wii Fit" was uploaded to YouTube by Bernat's boyfriend Giovanny Gutierrez, in which Bernat could be seen gyrating in her underwear while playing a game with the Nintendo Wii Fit controller. Within four years, the video amassed over 11.8 million views. While the origin of the phrase is unknown, the popular image associated with the phrase dates back to April 20th 2005, in which the image was posted to a Thai forum known as Pantip.[1] The first known use of the phrase along with the images was in 2006 on a ytmnd page by user comm1e. The page gained over 2,700 views.[2]  On May 22nd, 2007, British IT sales consultant Howard Davies-Carr uploaded a homemade movie of his two boys playing around on a chair to his YouTube channel. Filmed on March 19th, 2007 and titled "Charlie bit my finger – again," the minute-long video shows Harry putting his finger into Charlie's mouth several times, and getting bitten each time, though not long before Harry yells out "ouch" and complains about it to his father behind camera. While Howard originally intended to share the video with the boys' relatives living in the United States via email, he ultimately decided to share it in private on YouTube, because the file size was too big for email attachment. As the video made the rounds within his personal network, Davies-Carr switched the viewability of the video to public for the sake of convenience. On July 27th, 2004, SomethingAwful Goon Shmorky uploaded several modified versions of the syndicated comic series Nancy and Archie to his personal website, which included the word "Zalgo" in two comics in the series.[1] On August 22nd, 2009, Shmorky explained the origin of Zalgo in a post on the SomethingAwful Forums[2]: The character of Slowpoke[1], a large pink Water/Psychic type creature that resembles a cross between a salamander and a hippopotamus, first appeared in the original two Pokemon games Red and Blue. It is known for being less bright than other creatures and can easily get distracted. An image of a Slowpoke on a white background was first introduced on 4chan, specifically the /b/ (random) board, as a method of trolling, accompanied by a post that was clearly untimely or no longer relevant in current news. One of the earliest archived posts featuring Slowpoke was captioned "Christmas hat!" and uploaded on December 26th, 2006.[4] The phrase was first popularized by Canadian comedian Mike Myers in the 1992 blockbuster comedy Wayne's World[1]. In the film, Wayne uses the phrase in response to his sidekick Garth while shooting a local access television show in his basement. Garth: "Hey are you through yet? Cause I'm getting tired of holding this." Wayne: "That's what she said." The original image is (ironically) of a Common Raven (Corvus Corax) taken by photographer Timothy Blackmore and posted in his zezero.com website on 1997.[1] According to recounts, Rich Raven macros have been appearing since 2008.[2] Before being used as an Advice Animal macro, the original picture was photoshopped with a top hat (or gibus), cane, and a bottle of liquor. Mike Blount created his first homepage titled "Hello My Future Girlfriend"[1] in 1998 while in the sixth grade, lying about his age so he could create an account on the now-defunct web host Tripod. After taking a two-day beginner HTML class, Blount made the site out of what he would later call "an act of desperation."[2] On April 17, 2005, user Dasyati uploaded the site Conan is…AN ALLIGATOR to YTMND. It now has over 530,000 views. This site spawned many other sites editing the GIF image, along with sites having "Conan is…" in their titles. The first YTMND to parody the original appears to be Conan is…..the end of the world? by Billson. However, the first spin-off to become very popular was Conan is…A STAPLER! by user nibbzious. On March 23rd, 1996, the comedy television show Saturday Night Live[5] debuted the first "Roxbury Guys" sketch, in which comedians Chris Kattan, Will Ferrell and Jim Carrey bob their heads in unison to the song "What is Love" while driving in a car (shown below). On June 2nd, 2005, YTMND user ligamentx submitted a page[3] titled What is love, featuring a GIF of the car scene (shown below) accompanied by a looped audio clip of "What is Love."

The word "Internets" was first uttered during the third round of the Bush-Gore presidential debate held at Washington University in St. Louis on October 17th, 2000.[1] In response to a question asked by an audience member regarding the state of morality in the American media and popular culture, Bush replied: The incident was largely overlooked until Bush repeated the mistake during the presidential debate against United States Senator John Kerry on October 8th, 2004 at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri (shown below). On February 13th, 2008, San Francisco-based writer Mathew Honan created a single serving site under the domain BarackObamaIsYourNewBicycle.com, which randomly generated a series of hypothetical statements illustrating the Democratic presidential candidate as a digital-savvy and personable do-gooder. The original Hampster Dance website was created by Canadian Deidre LaCarte, an art student at the time, during a competition between her best friend and sister to see who could generate the most web traffic.[20] Using the web hosting service GeoCities[19], LaCarte created an homage to her pet hampster, Hampton, featuring 392 animated hampster sprites doing different dances[1] in August 1998. She paired the GIFs with a 9-second WAV file that contained a sped-up sample from the song "Whistle Stop"[2] by Roger Miller, written for the 1973 Disney cartoon Robin Hood.[3] Though the original site is now gone, mirrors were put up by WebHamster[1] in February 1999 and educator Lee Sonko[19] in 2002. The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air is an American sitcom series starring Will Smith as a fictionalized version of himself, a teenager from West Philadelphia who is sent to move in with relatives in affluent Bel Air area. The first episode was aired on September 10th, 1990. According to several references including Oh Internet[13], the Bel-Air copypasta originated on 4chan circa 2004 when someone on /b/ (random) board started telling a serious story but then halfway through, suddenly derailed into the lyrics of the show's opening theme song. The earliest recognition of using "Bel-Air" as a verb can be found in an Urban Dictionary[1] entry submitted by user Astroman on October 19th, 2006. "Bel Air," when used as a verb, means to copy a story that another person has posted to the Internet and replace the last half with the lyrics to "Fresh Prince of Bel-Air."  The phenomenon originally began as a website founded by Dino Ignacio in 1998[1], featuring short, humorous backstories for each "Bert is Evil" image posted on the site. As the website continued to gain a cult-like status throughout the year, it became too costly for Ignacio to continue with the site operations. Rather than shutting his site down, he instead offered anyone to mirror-host his original website. As a result, dozens of mirror sites appeared online, further boosting the meme's popularity and visibility on the web. In 1998, Dino Ignacio, Wout J Reinders and Jasper Hulshoff Pol accepted the Webby Award and the People's Voice Award for Best Weird Website at the Palace of Fine Arts auditorium in San Francisco. On October 8th, 2008, the original illustration of the Philosoraptor was released and copyrighted by creator Sam Smith as a T-shirt design for sale on the online retailer Lonely Dinosaur[1] (shown below). In an e-mail exchange with Know Your Meme, Smith revealed that the idea for "Philosoraptor" image was conceived sometime in the early of summer of 2008. The final image wasn't created until late summer and the t-shirts went into production in August and September that year. According to Chris Ainsworth of the gaming blog Driph[1], the Awesome Face was part of a series of emoticons designed and illustrated for the Pokemon-related web forum Pokemopolis. He claims to have contacted the creator of the image, and published the following correspondence: The original "Fuck You, I'm an Anteater" image first appeared online in spring of 2008, as a witty protest against the massive amounts of cute cat and dog pics circulating around internet humor sites, while many other species had largely been neglected. The anteater's proper manner of speech certainly stood out and caught on quickly, appearing on the front page of Digg.com on May 10th, 2008. On the next day, Single Topic Blog fuck-you-im-an-anteater.com was launched. The same instance of "Fuck You, I'm an Anteater" was reposted on Fotolog.com on May 11th, followed by another reblog two days later on Boredom.net on May 13th.  It is unclear when the image macro of Spy with a mouthful of cigarettes first appeared online. It appears to have begun spreading as a meme in 2008. On January 26th, 2008, it was used by an anonymous user in a 4chan thread,[1] though its likely that the image existed before the post (shown below). Between 2004 and 2007, a series of short advertisements named "Ronald Rumors" (Japanese: ドナルドのうわさ – Donald no uwasa) were broadcast on Japanese television.[12] They featured a Japanese version of Ronald McDonald asking trivial questions about himself. The answers were then posted on the official McDonald's website. These ads were mostly targeted towards children and, in most of them, Ronald does his infamous "Ran Ran Ru" pose (popular example of "Ran Ran Ru" ad shown below). Translation : Slide: What is "Ran Ran Ru"? Ronald: Ran Ran Ru! When Ronald gets happy I always have to do this. Come on everyone, join in! Here we go! RAN RAN RUU! Nico Nico Douga users (NND) were the first to remix "Ran Ran Ru" advertisements. On May 3rd, 2007, NND[4] user すこぺん uploaded a video mashup featuring one of the McDonald's commercials spliced together with footage from the Japanese TV series Ultraman Mebius, garnering over 32,000 views in 13 years (shown below) and representing the first "Ran Ran Ru" edit. GoldenEye 007[1] was released exclusively for the Nintendo 64 on August 25th, 1997. Details of this specific glitch were mentioned online as early as December 2000 in a GameFAQs guide article[2], which referred to the bug as “Spinning Guards." The article also explained how to deliberately achieve this effect by walking up to a guard and lift the left side of the cartridge out of the console slowly until the guard began to spin out of control. This type of glitching is also known as “cartridge tilting.”[6] Meanwhile, the first video demonstration of this glitch in GoldenEye 007 was uploaded to Japanese video sharing site Nico Nico Douga (NND) on July 12th, 2007.[3] Nearly two weeks later on July 24th, 2007, another NND user paired the footage of the spinning guard with the 1997 J-pop song "Promise"[4] by Kohmi Hirose. This version, titled ""007 Golden Eye Chaos Carnival – GET-DDAN"[5], with the word “GET-DAN” being the Engrish pronunciation for the phrase “Get Down.” On December 6th, 2008, the SCSA West Coast Circuit Super Smash Bros. Melee tournament was held, which included a doubles match between a green team consisting of player SilentSpectre as Captain Falcon and player Tang as Fox against the blue team of players Zhu and Lucky as Fox. After the green team executes a doubles combo against Zhu, the commentators HomeMadeWaffles, Phil and Mango loudly yell various phrases such as "happy feet," referencing Zhu's "Happy Feet" video,[3] and "wombo combo" (shown below). Two days later, YouTuber Lumpycpu uploaded footage of the match, which gained over 10.3 million views and 22,300 comments in the next eight years.  The commercial for Flea Market Montgomery[8] was recorded some time in 2006 and a 30 second version was uploaded to YouTube by dogcows[1] on October 7th of that year. A two minute version was uploaded by YouTuber teedadawg[2] on November 30th, 2006. As of January 2012, the extended version has over 7.4 million views and over 165,000 Facebook shares.[3] In March 2006, NBC affiliated news station WPMI reported on a rumored sighting of a leprechaun in Mobile, Alabama, which included various commentaries from several Crichton area residents. On March 17th, YouTuber [1] botmib uploaded the newscast onto his channel, which quickly went viral on the then newly launched videos sharing site. The YouTube clip has received over 21 million views and an additional 1.8 million views from a reuploaded version as of July 2012. On February, 2nd 2009, TMZ released an unedited audio segment from the set of "Terminator Salvation" (captured previously in July, 2008), which evidently reveals Christian Bale gong ballistic on Director of Photography Shane Hurlbut for about four minutes. For many fans, the famous English actor went from a superstar fairy-tale hero to a complete and utter d-bag. You can listen to the original, uncut freakout here. The delightful and ingenious phrase, "Interior crocodile alligator, I drive a Chevrolet movie theater" was derived originally by Cleveland area rapper Chip tha Ripper within his musical work, "S.L.A.B. Freestyle". The most famous and well known audio source originates from a live in-studio radio performance on the Street Starz Radio show hosted by Prettyboy Floyd. On September 22, 2007, a SomethingAwful administrator made a post to the FYAD boards with a thread called INTERIOR CROCODILE ALLIGATOR. The page HTML was altered to play the phrase in the background on a loop, the post consisted only of an image of a crocodile. The thread would then be submitted to digg 8 days later. YouTube links that may suggest the date of the original song upload link to deleted videos or TOS violations. Not soon after the original FYAD post, a YTMND user uploaded a page using the exact same image and sound clip. However the page may have been deleted and recreated or altered in some way as the page is currently dated December 1, 2007. A music video titled INTERIOR CROCODILE ALLIGATOR showing alligators hopping and moving to the song was posted July 19th, 2008 and has gained 5.7 million views as of April 25th, 2016 (shown below).  On February 12, 2007, Arnezami, a user of the Doom9 forums, posted[1] the aforementioned code that could be used to break the encryption on HD-DVDs. Shortly afterward, Wired published[2] an article on the new-found key. It was then thrust[3] into the limelight, with many websites and blogs weighing in on the situation. On September 17th, 2007, Senator John Kerry gave a speech at the University of Florida as part of the Constitution Day forum organized by the school’s student government.[1] Nearing the end of the event, undergraduate student Andrew Meyer[2] walked up to the microphone stand and criticized Kerry for repeatedly evading his questions: "Why don't you answer my questions, I have been waiting and listening to you speak in circles for the last two hours." When he finally got the floor, Mayer asked Kerry about his involvement with the organization known as Skull & Bones.[3] Kerry had admitted to being a member of Yale’s secret society while studying there, but Meyer pushed his argument to the point in which school officials shut off his microphone. Meyer was eventually forced away from the area by police and tasered repeatedly while he screamed, “Don’t tase me, bro!” The earliest known post featuring Raptor Jesus appeared on January 19th, 2006 in a post from DeviantArt [5] user Devious_Derek (shown below). The first instance of Rageguy came in 2008 on the 4chan /b/ imageboard. The image consisted of a 4-pane comic made in MS Paint portraying the "toilet splashback" experience[1]. The first three panes described the incidence and in the fourth pane, a drawing of Rageguy screaming appeared with a caption saying "FFFFFFUUUUUUUUUU-" on the right of the face in red letters. Broslma uploaded a lib dub video of the song "Dragostea din tei" titled "Numa Numa Dance" to the flash animation site Newgrounds[3] on December 6th, 2004, receiving over 15.7 million views and 2,200 pages of comments over the next eight years. On August 14th, 2006, YouTuber xloserkidx uploaded a mirror of the video, which has accrued over 49 million views as of December 6th, 2012. The still images were taken from the interrogation scene in the 2008 Batman film The Dark Knight[1], directed by Christopher Nolan and released in July 2008. In the scene, Batman (played by Christian Bale) is interrogating the Joker (played by Heath Ledger) about his involvement in the disappearances of Harvey Dent and Rachel Dawes. While the exact first instance is unknown, the original template has been attributed to /b/.[7] Some of the earliest versions of the four-pane image macros were posted to Flickr[2] on August 3rd, 2008 and SplatterMail.org[3] on August 8th, 2008, but has since been taken down. The expression had been used in pop culture previous to the internet, first seen in a March 1996 episode[2] of the television comedy Friends titled “The One Where Dr. Ramoray Dies.”[1] In the scene, Joey (played by Matt LeBlanc) is explaining to Phoebe (played by Lisa Kudrow) how he writes his own lines on the television show he works on. He tells her that he took the original line "If we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to die" and changed it to "If this woman doesn't get to a hospital, she's not gonna live." Realizing he just rephrased the script and did not do any actual writing, Phoebe responds with "I see what you did there" as a method of patronizing him. Online, one of the earliest archived uses of the phrase appeared on the Ultimate Ju-jitsu Forum[3] on July 18th, 2003 when a member posted a joke about a Jujitsu martial arts center named the Boy Club, asking if it was a reference to the blue corner of a ju-jitsu mat, to which another poster responded with “ah ha, i see what you did there." The barrel roll has been used as an airplane aerial combat technique since dogfighting emerged in 1913 during World War I. The barrel roll maneuver was later included as a move in the Super Nintendo console game Star Fox that was released in the US the spring of 1993. In the game, the player could perform a barrel roll by double tapping the L and R buttons, protecting the ship from enemy lasers. The phrase "do a barrel roll" comes from the sequel Star Fox 64 released on June 30th, 1997, in which the character Peppy Hare orders you to "Do a barrel roll!" while approaching 4 stationary turrets firing lasers. The phrase "combo breaker" originally appeared in the 1994 arcade fighting game Killer Instinct.[1] In the game, a player can utilize a special move to stop their opponent from completing a combo attack. When a combo breaker is successfully completed, an in-game message that read ’C-C-C-Combo Breaker!" would appear on screen. The term began appearing on the web in April 2004, when the first YTMND site[2] with the phrase was created, using an audio clip from the game. In August of that year, the first definition of the phrase was added to Urban Dictionary[5], stating that it was used on message boards to break up chains of posts repeating the same phrase. The original image macro first appeared on 4chan in early 2007 and experienced a resurgence in late 2008 on Reddit, Tumblr, and social networking sites. The Yo Dawg series has a unique characteristic in being recursive. This multi-layered structure in the Yo Dawg formula makes it reminiscent of the "strange loops" described in Douglas Hofstadter's Gödel, Escher, Bach. The original photograph of Xzibit comes from a set of studio portraits that were originally used to promote the 2006 sports drama film Gridiron Gang, in which the rapper plays the role of a minor character named Malcolm Moore. The video of a man performing ninja moves in an afro was posted in 2005 for a series of commercials for the PS2 game Tekken 5 (shown below). The exact origin of its first posting is not known. As Encyclopedia Dramatica offensively put it, "one interesting thing to note about the Afro Ninja video is that very few people seem to have any clue where it actually came from, so everyone just assumed it was some stupid nigger with a misdirected desire to become a martial artist. This has led to numerous retards making up stories and trying to claim the video as their own finding."[1] A video titled afro ninja containing the meme was uploaded to YouTube January 17th, 2007 by user airmoney, in which a man with an afro tries to do ninja-like moves (shown below). As of April 24th, 2016 the video has 17.3 million views and 49.9k likes.[2] This video was posted with a hefty amount of eBaum's World advertised on it, but they are not the original owners of the video. The surrealist painting of the laughing fruit, titled The Biting Pear of Salamanca[1], was posted to deviantART on February 27th, 2006 by Ursula Vernon.[2] Inspired by pop surrealism, she wrote that the pear "lives off low-flying birds, hand-outs, and the occasional unwary sightseer." As early as November 2006[3], a user on 4chan's /b/ (Random) message board had associated the photo with the caption LOLWUT. The photograph of the girl and the burning house was taken by Dave Roth[1] in January 2005[2] during the local fire department's live drill training two blocks away from his home in Mebane, North Carolina. While observing the fire, Dave caught his daughter, Zoe, smiling devilishly juxtaposed against the burning house. Roth first uploaded the photo of his daughter, which he titled "Firestarter," to the image hosting service Zooomr[3] on January 2nd 2007. However, it did not receive much attention until later that year on November 29th when Roth submitted the same image to JPG Magazine[4] for an "Emotion Capture" competition. The photo was selected for publication in the February / March 2008 print issue of the magazine.[5] On February 22nd, 2008, YouTuber Ted Suzan posted a video entitled "I accidentally a piano bench; is this dangerous?" The post received more than 1,300 views in 11 years (shown below). Weekes later, on May 20th, 2008, an anonymous 4chan user on the /b/ (random) board posted a version of the title.. The original poster stated that they had just "accidentally 93MB of .rar files" and wanted to know what they should do and if it was dangerous. Other posters responded both with comments on the post's lack of grammar as well as variations on the phrase "I accidentally". Although the original thread was not archived, a screenshot of the post has been floating around the web since. Nehal Patel, a Univerisity of Illinois student, created the first "Mr. T Ate My Balls" website in 1996. Although most of the original "ate my balls" websites are now defunct and the meme has all but fallen out of use, the original version cached from 1998 can be found here. Magibon, also known as MRirian on YouTube, uploaded her first video on July 2, 2006, aptly titled "Me doing nothing." In the video, Magibon can be seen staring at the monitor screen, occasionally smiling and sometimes waving her hand before the camera. Since then, Magibon has uploaded dozens of other videos on her YouTube Channel, some of which feature her real voice, mostly speaking in basic Japanese. In this particular video, which has been viewed over 5 million times, Magibon practices her Japanese skills by saying things like "Pizza is delicious" or "I'm studying Japanese." During a surprise visit and press conference in December, 2008, George W. Bush would visit Iraq for a final time before ending his tenure as President of the United States of America. The press conference with Iraq Prime Minister, Nouri Al Maliki, was interrupted when Iraqi journalist Al-Zaidi threw both of his shoes at the outgoing US President, shouting "This is a farewell kiss from the Iraqi people, you dog" and "This is for the widows and orphans and all those killed in Iraq", before being detained by guards. Due to the conference being broadcast by many news networks around the world and due to the press and public attention to any event related to the President of the US, animated gifs and parody videos quickly spread around the internet. The loop animation was originally taken from a scene in the second episode of the Japanese anime series Bleach, titled "A Shinigami's Work", where it shows character Orihime Inoue twirling a leek stock while showing off her groceries to protagonist Ichigo Kurosaki. According to the Russian internet culture database Lurkmore[1], the flash animated loop of Orihime spinning her leek to a 90's a-Capella rendition of "Ievan Polkka", performed by the finnish pop group Loituma, was created by Russian LiveJournal user g_r_e_e_n and was shared to the blogging site on April 23rd, 2006. The flash was mostly contained in Russian LiveJournal before breaking into the English-speaking web when a single serving site titled "LEEKSPIN"[2] was launched on May 6th, 2006. During his freshman year in 2005, Brian began helping with shooting videos at NewsWatch TV station in Waco, Texas. On March 22nd, he made his broadcast debut a bit earlier than expected, when he was given a chance to fill in for the regular sportscaster who was ill. But only a few minutes into his segment, Brian began losing track of the script as the lines were rolling faster than his reading pace. One of the more memorable quotes can be heard during his play-by-play commentary of an Indiana Pacers vs. New Jersey Nets game: Der Untergang[1] is a 2004 German war epic film directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel and based on the book "Inside Hitler's Bunker."[13] In the climax scene, Hitler (played by Bruno Ganz) hears from his generals that the final counter-offensive against the Soviets never took place and Germany's defeat is imminent. Hitler then orders everyone to leave except the four highest-rank generals, who oblige and listen nervously to his breakdown (shown below, left). On April 4th, 2006, YouTuber Edilson66 uploaded an edited version of the scene with edited Portuguese subtitles (shown below, right). The Tron suit was built by Jay Maynard from scratch for the annual Michigan sci-fi and fantasy convention Penguicon in 2004, where he won an award for best workmanship. The photographs of his DIY suit were originally posted on his now-defunct website[1], where he detailed his suit-making process. He submitted these photos to tech news site Slashdot[2] on April 18th, 2004, apparently inspired by another "Make Your Own TRON Costume" thread posted on Slashdot[3] two weeks prior: On October 13th, 2001, the song "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger", which sampled Edwin Birdsong's "Cola Bottle Baby", was released as a single by Daft Punk for the album Discovery. In 2009, a live version won a Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording. On October 11th, 2011, the music blog NME ranked the song at 132 in an list of "150 Best Tracks of the Part 15 Years." On June 6th, 2007, Seattle-based illustrator Austin Hall uploaded a video titled "Daft Hands – Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger" to his YouTube channel. According to the video description, it was recorded in one take without any post-production editing other than the words written on the introduction slide. In less than five years, the video received more than 53 million views and 175,000 comments, while being ranked at one point as one of the most viewed videos on YouTube in the "All Time" category. The expression originated with the character Cookie Monster from the children's television series Sesame Street,[1] who was invented by the American puppeteer Jim Henson in 1966. When given a plate of cookies, the monster would ravenously devour them while repeating the phrase "om nom nom." The earliest known appearance of the phrase "om nom" online was submitted to the website Urban Dictionary[2] on December 19th, 2004. The scene originates from the 2006 film 300 directed by Zack Snyder, an American film adapted from a graphic novel of the same name by Frank Miller, a fictionalized retelling of the Battle of Thermopylae The film tells the story of King Leonidas and his lead of 300 Spartans into battle against Persian King Xerxes and his army of more than one million soldiers. Right before battle, a Persian messenger arrives at the gates of Sparta demanding the submission of Sparta to King Xerxes. In response to this demand, Leonidas and his guards kick the messengers into the large well, immediately after shouting "This is Sparta!". The original photographs were taken of the southern elephant seal Minazo raised in Japan's Enoshima Aquarium. Minazo was known for his signature pose in which he would hold a bucket against his torse while sticking his tongue out of his mouth. The earliest known posting of Minazo holding a bucket with the caption "I has a bucket" was in a YTMND[15] page created by user ZombiePirate on July 24th, 2006, which was accompanied by the theme song from the television game show The Price is Right. On December 23rd, 2006 Flickr user T-Bisqit uploaded an image macro featuring a photograph of Minazo holding a bucket with the caption "I has a bucket", followed by another photograph of an aquarium employee next to Minazo with the caption "Noooo they be stealin' my bucket" (shown below). While the image macro is rumored to have originated on 4chan, no threads featuring the image have been archived prior to 2007. "LOL Internet" became popular following 4chan's 100,000 GET event on April 19, 2004. As a result, the phrase became a way to mock people taking the internet too seriously. However, "Lol, Internet" had a more enduring life as a series of YTMND sites depicting a character driving a vehicle with various captions based on the phrasal template "LOL, X." The original YTMND instance that paved the way for the series was uploaded by user Dunkinbean on April 7th, 2005. Titled "Steam, Steam,"[1] the GIF animation featured a picture of Ronald McDonald driving a convertible car and pointing his finger towards the sky, placed over a motion-blurred background and set to "Running in the 90s" by Italian disco artist Max Coveri. The site has since gained more than 1.1 million views as of May 2012. The original clip of Edgar's fall was posted on YouTube in May 2006[1]. The video begins with Edgar looking hesitant to cross a small stream using tree branches as a bridge. As soon as Edgar inches towards it, Fernando starts shaking one of the thick branches, causing Edgar to curse wildly in northern Mexican accent before losing balance and plunging into the water. For notable derivatives and remixes of the video clip, please refer to the video gallery. As of May 2011, Edgar's Fall still remains one of the most viewed videos on YouTube in Latin America with nearly 24 million views in aggregate. The earliest known reference of "You're Doing It Wrong" can be found in the domain name YoureDoingItWrong.com[1] registered on January 21st, 2004; however, there are no archives or records regarding the content of the site. The first known instance of the "You're Doing it Wrong" image macro series was created by Sabastien Grillmaier, who uploaded the image onto the Something Awful forum in August 2004. While the date of the original thread remains unknown, Grillmaier re-uploaded the image only days later on TribalWar Forums[2] under the name "Lone Gunman". The phrase and game footage used in the meme come from the 1992 port of the 1989 side-scrolling arcade shooter Zero Wing,[8] released on the SEGA Mega Drive. The quote is from the introduction sequence of the game in which the main antagonist, the leader of CATS appears to announce "all your base are belong to us" during an exchange with the ship's captain. The first GIF of the opening sequence is rumored to have originated on the Rage Games website in early 1998.[16] Additionally, the website Zany Video Game Quotes[11] has been credited with popularizing the GIF.[12][13] According to a timeline published on the site RetroGames.com,[15] the GIF was posted on the site Zany Video Game Quotes in "late 1998/early 1999." Mudkip[24] is a blue and orange water-type Pokemon character who first appeared in the Ruby and Sapphire games, released in the US in March 2003.[25] The phrase "so i herd you like mudkips" originated in early 2005 with the deviantArt group MudKipClub.[1] The account was founded on October 5th, 2004 as a place for users to share Pokemon fanart. The club was not limited to Mudkips, however, as the first artwork[3] depicted the character's final evolution, Swampert. The owner of the community began posting the phrase "so i herd you like mudkips" on other users' comment walls as early as February 7th, 2005.[2] While the motive behind the comments are unclear, the wall messages served as an invitation to join the MudKipClub community. Soulja Boy first started uploading his music to SoundClick in 2005, but it was his single "Crank That" recorded in March of 2007 that started his rise in popularity. The original instructional video has been taken off Youtube, but a number of reuploads are still available. Lauren Upton was chosen as Miss South Carolina Teen USA in November 2006 and the pageant was held on August 24th, 2007 in Pasadena, California. During the Q&A segment of the contest, Upton was given the following question by Friday Night Lights actress Aimee Teegarden: Tay Zonday (given name, Adam Nyerere Bahner) was a grad student from Minneapolis, Minnesota when he uploaded Chocolate Rain on April 22nd, 2007 (shown below). The song's strange lyrics like "chocolate rain, some stay dry while others feel the pain", would puzzle many viewers about what they actually meant. Later Tay would claim that the song was meant to be about institutional racism. Rick Astley's dance-pop single "Never Gonna Give You Up" was originally released as part of his 1987 solo debut album Whenever You Need Somebody. Upon its initial release, the single became a number one hit on several international charts, including the Billboard Hot 100 and UK Singles Chart[1]. YouTuber Erik Helwig claims to have prank called a Michigan radio station after a sports game and played "Never Gonna Give You Up" over the phone on August 31st, 2006. The story was explained in a YouTube video titled "I Did the First Rickroll (w/ Proof)" uploaded on August 7th, 2015 (shown below). According to the Online Etymology Dictionary[8], the interrogative word "what" stems from the Old English "Hwæt", an exclamation that roughly translates to "so." The term is also used in the opening line of Old English epic poem Beowolf: "Hwæt! We Gardena " || "in gear-dagum." ("So! The Spear-Danes in days gone by.") One of the first relevant Urban Dictionary[1] definitions was submitted by user Age on April 21st, 2003: A variation of the word "what". The word what is purposely misspelt to show dyslexia and stupidity. It can also be used as a lazy form of the word "what." According to Encyclopedia Dramatica, colloquial use of the term "wat" originated from the Something Awful forums, specifically in the FYAD (F**k You and Die) sub-community. However, this notion has not been verified. The original clip "Kneecam No. 1"[24] was produced by German visual artist Matthias Fritsch at the annual street techno festival "Fuck Parade" in Berlin, Germany on July 8th, 2000. According to Matthias, the original intention behind publishing the Kneecam video was to raise the question of its authenticity. The video[20] was first uploaded to YouTube by user subrelic on October 10th, 2006. According to the YouTube Insights, the video went largely unnoticed until some time in 2007 when it was posted on a Central American pornography site.[23] It has more than 16 million views as of January 2013.    The phrase began appearing online after it was uttered in the July 2008 Batman film The Dark Knight (shown below) by Bruce Wayne's butler Alfred Pennyworth (played by British actor Michael Caine) while explaining to Bruce Wayne (played by Christian Bale) that his nemesis, the Joker, is unlike any other criminal Batman has faced. The earliest known image macro containing the phrase as a caption was submitted to Cheezburger's Pundit Kitchen[8] on March 5th, 2009 featuring a photo of conservative American political commentator Rush Limbaugh. In George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire, the phrase "winter is coming" is prominently featured as the motto of House Stark of Winterfell, a noble clan renowned for its fortified ancient castle. It was also used in the HBO series Game of Thrones as the title of the pilot episode, which aired on April 17th, 2011, as well as for several promotional trailers and posters. An image macro featuring a photo of an owl and the phrase "winter is coming" (shown below, left) was submitted to Quickmeme[1] in July 2011, but the phrase didn't take off until it was paired with an HBO promotional portrait of Ned Stark (played by Sean Bean) later in August that year. The earliest known instance using this image (shown below, right) surfaced shortly after the U.S. East Coast earthquake on August 23rd, 2011.  The first finger box was reportedly invented by the artist A-yo in 1964 (examples below). However, this has been disputed, with some saying that the finger box was created before World War II.[1] The boxes were small wooden boxes filled with various items. The observer would then put their fingers into the whole of the box to feel the contents inside. The song "Artificial Intelligence Bomb" was released as an entry for the 1st user-generated online NSF (NES Sound Format) competition Famicompo which was held from May to July 2003[1], and was written by a Japanese competitor Naruto. The song ranked the 2nd place in the contest, and it was the highest rank among the original songs. The first YTPMV of the song was uploaded by YouTube user fezzyfay[2] on May 8th, 2011, which used a famous YouTube celebrity Mystery Guitar Man.[3]  Leonardo da Vinci painted the original The Last Supper[2] between 1495 and 1498 on a dining room wall in the monastery of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan, Italy. The painting was meant to portray the reactions of Jesus' twelve disciples at the moment he revealed that one of them would betray him. Though da Vinci's painting was not the first artwork based on this Bible passage[3], it is the first to attempt to portray the disciples with more emotional facial expressions than previous artists Domenico Castagno and Pietro Perugino.[4] It is traditionally considered the painting that began the High Renaissance[5] period in art history. Among the earliest parodies of da Vinci's masterpiece was created by pop artist Andy Warhol[6], who completed a series of over 100 different pieces[7] based on the painting in 1986. His final series of paintings[8], Warhol combined aspects of the original painting with images from modern pop culture, including brand logos and bright colors. Many other artworks inspired by The Last Supper came thereafter. The doorbell "EC5227WP" was originally produced by Panasonic.[1] Although not designed specifically for the convenience store chain, the melody became synonymous with entering a FamilyMart store due to its usage as the greeting doorbell in many locations. The original song (shown below, left) was first uploaded to NND by an NND pianist known as Matsuken Teacher on August 2nd, 2007. In the YouTube video description, Matsuken Teacher pointed to the association between the melody and FamilyMart. While the song had been occasionally sampled in a number of MAD remix videos since 2007, it didn't raise any significant attention until two years later on September 9th, 2009, when it was sampled in a 2-bar melody Electribe[2] remix video created by NND user KN.[3] Titled "Tension Rises When Entering FamilyMart" in rough translation, the video gained one million views within the first month of release on Nico Nico Douga. Ted began an Angelfire[1] page on March 23rd, 2001 to share his caving journal online. The posts detail events that occurred in December 2000 when Ted and his friend Brad, whom he referred to as "B," began exploring a cave they found close to their home. When they entered the cave, they found a narrow passageway with a small hole that they begin to drill through in order to explore further. The blog documents the strange occurrences Ted, Brad, and later, their friend Joe[3], encounter including ghastly screaming, unnatural wind, and strange hieroglyphs that appear deep inside the cave. The blog abruptly ends on May 19th, 2001 with a post[4] detailing a three week period of time after their last visit to the cave. During this time, each of the cavers reportedly suffered from hallucinations and nightmares, leading to Ted, Joe and B agreeing to visit the cave one final time for closure. Prepared to enter the cave with a gun and a knife, Ted stated in the final blog post that he will update the website immediately after he returns with answers to everyone’s questions. The site has not been updated since.   The first mugging photo was posted to Instagram on April 12th, 2013 by blogger Ilana Wiles[1] as a submission to photographer Josh Johnson's daily photography challenge with the theme "fun."[2] Though it did not get featured as part of the challenge, the photo accrued more than 420 likes and 34 comments within ten days. She also encouraged her Instagram followers to post their own mugging photos with the hashtag #babeinamug.[3] According to the now-defunct website TwitchTVFaces,[8] the TwitchTV streamer Ernest Le[6] would sometimes speak in a different voice while referring to himself as "Frankerz," which led a TwitchTV staff member to add the FrankerZ emoticon using a photograph of Le's dog.[7][9] The earliest known mention of the dog face icon was featured in a blog post about TwitchTV emoticons by gamer Ashe Soriano[10] on January 31st, 2012. The earliest known "one million likes" drive on Facebook was launched by the international charity group Free The Children to promote its annual youth empowerment event We Day in September 2010, not long after Facebook released its "like" button feature in April. Free the Children pledged that for every person who "likes" We Day's Facebook page, its sponsors will donate $1 to the charity. However, the first casual instance of "One Million Likes" plea to go viral came in November 2012, after Dan Urbano from Newton, Massachusetts made a bet with his children that if their picture asking for a cat got 1,000 likes on Facebook, he would make their wish come true. Within hours of posting on November 7th, the Facebook plea made by Urbano's children surpassed its goal and by November 12th, it had received more than 110,000 likes and 100,000 shares. The phenomenon was started by Laura DeMerchant, a Los Angeles-based film producer who began collecting unicorn masks and offering to take pictures of her friends as early as last fall. As her "unicorning" photo collection grew, DeMerchant eventually began sharing her photographs via Twitter[1] and Instagram[6] on March 26th, 2013, followed by the launch of the single topic blog UnicornArmy.com[3] on June 2nd.  The original image of a red-eyed Baboon staring into a dark kitchen is said to have originated in one of 4Chan's Legendary Creepy Threads, although it is not clear which Imageboard it was posted under. The image was allegedly inspired by a recurring nightmare that a person had as a child.[2] On October 3rd, 2006, YTMND user Kacen uploaded a site called |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||3||||||||||||||||||||||||||| featuring the image in question with music from the Silent Hill series. The YTMND went on to gather over 900 votes (with a site average of 4.09/5.00), over 140 favorites, over 300 comments, over 69,000 views, and a $38.54 sponsorship from another user.[3] Photos highligiting hamsters buttocks began circulating among Japanese hamster owners' Twitter in May 2012. A twitter post known as the first instance which gave hamsters buttocks the nickname "Hamuketsu", a portmanteau of the Japanese words for "Ham(ster)" and "Ketsu" (Buttocks), was uploaded on May 16th, 2012 by a Japanese mangaka Megumi Hisai.[1] http://t.co/2iLWi1WM　 http://t.co/OOv8tjou　やっぱハムケツだな。うん。 — 久井めぐみ「元祖ハムケツ5月30日発売」 (@megumihisai) May 16, 2012 Inspired by the cute photos and its catchy nickname, it quickly became a popular activity among hamster owners to post their own "Hamuketsu" photos to that social network. A Naver Matome page reprinting many of those Hamuketsu photos was launched just 2 days after the first Twitter post[2], and the word "Hamuketsu" was added to a famous Japanese online glossary Hatena Keyword on 23rd in that month.[3] However, it had to wait the following year for further spreading. On May 14th, 2009, a post was submitted in the /v/ (video games) board on 4chan arguing that the majority of spiders are harmless and urging readers to "man the fuck up." A two-pane image was subsequently created featuring a screenshot of the post accompanied by an illustration of a giant spider angrily typing on a computer keyboard (shown below).  In the episode, Spongebob and Patrick were trying to sell chocolate bars and Spongebob told Patrick to flatter the customer to make the customer feel better so he could buy their chocolate bars. When they arrived at the customer's door, Patrick then proceeded to say "I love you". On October 3rd, 2013, the official League of Legends channel on YouTube released the song "Get Jinxed" as promotion for their new champion Jinx, a manic and impulsive criminal armed with a minigun and various other weapons;[3] featuring the vocals of Agnete Kjølsrud, from the Norwegian band Djerv. In less than two years, the video recieved over 43 milion views and 90,000 comments. The quote originally appeared in the scene from the Chapter 443 "Bucciarati Is Coming, Part 1" of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Vento Aureo, the fifth part of the manga, originally released on January 10th, 1996. [1] In the scene, character Bruno Buccellati (Bucciarati) is questioning main protagonist Giorno Giovanna if he knows what happened to character Leaky-Eye Luca, who was in critical condition at that time because of a previous encounter with Giorno. Despite denying that he met Luca, and apparently losing Bruno, Giorno realizes he was holding Luca's right eye the entire time and starts sweating nervously. Bruno then appears behind Giorno, licks the sweat off his cheek, and proclaims that the sweat tastes like that of a liar[2]. On August 2nd, 2005, Urban Dictionary[1] user Erica Peters submitted an entry for "turnt," defining it as the state of being "horny," "drunk," "f*cked up" or "crunk." During the Los Angeles riots in 1992, photographs and video of Korean store owners defending their businesses by camping on rooftops with rifles circulated through news media. On January 18th, 2011, the Los Angeles Times[5] published an article about the riots, which highlighted a photograph of several Koreans armed with rifles on a rooftop (shown below). On August 11th, the ArmBritain YouTube channel uploaded a news segment about the Korean business owners , which gained over 510,000 views and 1,900 comments over the next five years. Knuckles made his first appearance in 1994's Sonic the Hedgehog 3[1] as an antagonist to Sonic and Tails, as he was tricked by the villainous Dr. Robotnik into thinking the characters were thieves. He became a playable character in Sonic & Knuckles, which was released later that year.  Bogeyman tales first made their appearance around the 16th and 17th century. According to the Online Ethymology Dictionary,[1] the word "bogey" is probably a variation of the German word bogge, which in turn is a variant of the Middle English bugge, meaning "a frightening specter". The earliest modern form of the word was "bogle" (definition: ghost), which was popularized around the 1800's in the English literature and based on the similar Scottish word attested around 1500. The original drawing stems from Calvin and Hobbes, a daily comic strip illustrated by American cartoonist Bill Watterson that ran in more than 250 U.S. newspapers from 1985 to 1995.[4] During its decade-long run, Watterson developed a recurring visual motif in which Calvin and Hobbes are crossing a body of water over a makeshift bridge. This image originally shows up in 1988 Sunday comic collection: The Calvin and Hobbes Lazy Sunday Book.[13] A very similar version of this image is found in a comic strip published on April 19th, 1992,[3] and this "Log Bridge" instance being one of the most widely recognized iterations in the series. On October 27th, 2007, DeviantArt user spacecoyot[1] uploaded a historical fanart illustration of Renaissance thinkers John Calvin and Thomas Hobbes, after whom the cartoon characters were named, crossing a log just like in the original drawing.[2] On September 16th, 2006, Urban Dictionary[1] user Leah&Jenna submitted an entry for "vagina bone," defining the term as slang for "pelvis bone." At the annual Grammys Awards on February 13th, 2011, R&B artist Cee Lo performed a psychedelic, space-age themed rendition of his hit single "F*ck You," guest-starring a band of Muppets and American actress Gwyneth Paltrow. In terms of stage design & presentation, Cee Lo's Grammy performance of "Forget You" shares much resemblance to Elton John's 1977 performance of "The Crocodile Rock" on The Muppet Show: According to MTV News[3], the concept behind Sunday night's show was put forth by the artist himself, who approached the Henson Company with the idea to bring an army of Muppets on stage during the performance: Janeanne Garofalo[1] is a stand-up comedian and political activist best known for her outspoken liberal political views and harsh satires of American conservatism. During her appearance on MSNBC's Countdown with Keith Olbermann on April 16th, 2009, she asserted that all members of the highly conservative Tea Party members were being racists. "Let's be very honest about what this is about. This is not about bashing Democrats. It's not about taxes. They have no idea what the Boston Tea party was about. They don't know their history at all. It's about hating a black man in the White House." The clip was uploaded onto YouTube on the same day and subsequently picked up by both liberal and conservative political blogs. Months later in September 2009, users on 4chan's /b/ (random) board began using advice animal-style image macros of the comedienne to make fun of hypocritical or self-contradictory statements put forth by self-claimed leftists.[researching] The earliest known instance of image macro (shown right) can be found in Photobucket user blackxlinerxrun's /b/ folder[15] on September 7th, 2009. The series can be also seen as the predecessor of College Liberal image macros. The earliest known reference article about Polybius was first added to game repository Coinop.org[1] on August 3rd, 1998. The original submission[2] provided little information regarding the history of the game, aside from the description of an abstract puzzle/space shooter game named after a Greek historian[7] that was only released in one or two arcades outside of Portland. The article also noted that the machine was regularly visited by men in black coats who would come to collect "records," citing the account of one of the arcades' alleged owners who suspected they were part of a paramilitary technology group. In addition, the entry included a photograph of the title screen bearing the text “© 1981 Sinneslöschen" (loosely translated as "sensory-extinguishing" in German) as well as mysterious reports of children suffering from amnesia, sleeping disorders or inexplicable trauma after playing the game. The best answer if it's fake (IF), is that it was based off an obscure, and rare German arcade cabinet called "Poly-Play" which was a collection of eight games including a puzzler and space shooter. On July 20th, 2016, United States Senator and Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz delivered a speech at the Republican National Convention, during which he congratulated Donald Trump on his victory in the primaries, though he ultimately refused to endorse him as the Republican Party's presidential candidate by urging the attendees to "vote their conscience" in November. As the audience began booing at Cruz, Getty Images photographer Win McNamee[1] captured the reaction of Trump and his family looking rather displeased with Cruz. Video remixes in this seirs mainly use the audio track "Cid's Test Course" (Japanese: シドのテストコース) from 1999 video game for PSX console Chocobo Racing by Square (now Square Enix).[1] This song is also remixed version of "Chocobo Theme" from the J-RPG series Final Fantasy.
