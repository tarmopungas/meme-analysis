In explaining the most common method of peer-review, Kennedy mentions how reviewers would typically type in ""LGTM"" to express their approval, especially when communicating via email. Previous to Mondrian code review was conducted largely over e-mail using Google command-line wrappers built on top of Perforce. A developer could initiate a code review from within the g4 mail tool, which would fire off an e-mail and begin a review thread. When the developer receives a response of “looks good to me,” or lgtm for short, they could proceed to checkin.","['github', 'review', 'approval', 'lg', 'life is good', 'trademark', 'tm', 'looks good to me', 'acronym', 'internet slang', 'programmer']",2008,2019-10-30,"['hashtag', 'image-macro', 'slang']"

While Donald Duck has been part of the Disney canon since 1934, the earliest known example of the infamous picture of him with a supposed erection online appeared on the helli6n wordpress on August 2nd, 2010.[1] The image has since been removed, but less than a month later, on September 6th, the image (shown below) appeared on Funnyjunk with a watermark from 4gifs.com, meaning it likely dates back farther.

However, a rock underneath his mattress pushes all the way through his body, creating a bump in his stomach that looks like an erection.","['donald duck', 'disney', 'dolan', 'boner', 'sex', 'penis', 'erection', 'helli6n', 'wide open spaces', 'crosssockdance', 'mcdrawrhumperdink', 'mickey mouse']",1940,2021-05-11,[]
