The book focused on the importance of self-replication in evolution and pointed to the gene as the unit of biological information that is subject to selection pressures.[1] He postulated that perhaps not only biological information undergoes natural selection and that anything that is capable of replicating itself would also be susceptible to selection pressures, like ideas and beliefs. The word ""meme"" was used to label this type of self-replicating cultural information, and it was derived from the Greek word mimema, which translates to ""something imitated"".","['meme', 'science', '1980s', 'maymay', 'knowyourmeme', 'encyclopedia dramatica', 'lol', 'meme overload', 'meme magic', 'memes', 'memeception', 'meme within a meme', 'richard dawkins', 'valeri syutkin', 'the selfish gene', 'replicate', 'mimema']",1976,2021-05-10,"['animal', 'catchphrase', 'hashtag', 'image-macro', 'photoshop', 'slang', 'viral-video']"

https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/che-guevaras-guerrillero-heroico,https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/000/795/Che_Guevara.jpg,Guerrillero Heroico (Heroic Guerrilla) is an iconic photograph of Cuban Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara.,"The image of Guevara was taken by Cuban photographer Alberto Korda on March 5th, 1960, while attending a memorial service for victims of the La Coubre explosion in Havana, Cuba. According to historical accounts, Che briefly made a public appearance during the service, at which point Korda snapped just two frames of Che from a distance of about 25 to 30 feet before the guerrilla leader disappeared from sight. However, Korda's photo remained unpublished for seven years and he kept a cropped version of the original photo for his private collection. The photograph was then acquired by a wealthy Italian publisher and intellectual by the name of Giangiacomo Feltrinelli in 1967. Feltrinelli had just returned from Bolivia where he had hoped his fame would help in negotiating the release of French journalist and professor, Régis Debray. Debray was arrested because it was believed that he was in connection with guerrilla operations led by Che Guevara. As Guevara's eventual capture and/or death seemed to be imminent with the CIA closing in on his whereabouts, Feltrinelli acquired the rights to publish Che's captured Bolivian Diary. At this time, Feltrinelli asked Cuban officials where he could obtain portraits of Guevara. He was directed to Korda's studio where he presented a letter of introduction from the government. The document asked for Korda's assistance in finding a good portrait of Che. Korda immediately knew that his favorite image of Che was perfect and pointed to the 1960 shot of Che hanging on the wall, saying that the photo was the best of those he had taken of Che. Feltrinelli agreed and ordered 2 prints. When the rich Itallian returned the following day to acquire the copies, Korda told him that the man did not have to pay, for he was a friend of the Revolution. When Feltrinelli returned to Italy, he created thousands of copies of the poster to raise awareness of Che's precarious situation and impending demise. Later, in 1968, after Che was executed, Che's Bolivian Diary with Korda's photo on the cover was released worldwide. Feltrinelli also created posters to promote the book, which sold over 1 million copies. By this time, Korda's image had officially entered the public consciousness. Through Feltrinelli's actions, the picture had become famous. As a life-long communist and supporter of the Cuban revolution, Alberto Korda claimed no payment for his picture. Even though many parodies and imitations of the portrait were reproduced on a mass scale for decades, Korda never asked for anything in return. Korda reasoned that Che's image represented his revolutionary ideals, and thus the more his picture spread the greater the chance Che's ideals would spread as well. However, Korda did not want commercialization of the image in relation to products he believed Guevara would not support, especially alcohol. This belief was displayed for the first time in 2000, when Smirnoff used Che's picture in a vodka commercial. Korda sued Lowe Lintas and Rex Features, the company that supplied the photograph to the vodka distillery. Lintas and Rex retorted that the image was in the public domain. The final result was an out of court settlement for 50,000 U.S. dollars to be given to Korda, which the photographer, in turn, donated to the Cuban health care system. However, he was not against its propagation altogether, telling reporters:","['image macro', 'exploitable', 'che', 'guevara', 'photo', 'photograph', 'guerrillero', 'heroico', 'heroic', 'guerrilla', 'revloution', 'revolucion', 'alberto', 'korda', 'jim', 'fitzpatrick', 'poster', 'marxist', 'marxism', 'guerrillero heroico', 'protest']",1967,2019-11-05,[]
