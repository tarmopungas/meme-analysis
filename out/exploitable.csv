The word was coined by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene (shown below). The book focused on the importance of self-replication in evolution and pointed to the gene as the unit of biological information that is subject to selection pressures.[1] He postulated that perhaps not only biological information undergoes natural selection and that anything that is capable of replicating itself would also be susceptible to selection pressures, like ideas and beliefs. The word ""meme"" was used to label this type of self-replicating cultural information, and it was derived from the Greek word mimema, which translates to ""something imitated"".","['meme', 'science', '1980s', 'maymay', 'knowyourmeme', 'encyclopedia dramatica', 'lol', 'meme overload', 'meme magic', 'memes', 'memeception', 'meme within a meme', 'richard dawkins', 'valeri syutkin', 'the selfish gene', 'replicate', 'mimema']",1976,2021-05-10,"['animal', 'catchphrase', 'hashtag', 'image-macro', 'photoshop', 'slang', 'viral-video']",[],both

On April 14th, 2016, the French riot police force Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité (CRS) clashed against hundreds of angry demonstrators in Paris during a violent street protest against the French government's proposed labor code reform. As the riot police officers of the CRS began advancing towards the crowd to disperse the demonstration, which included use of canned tear gas, a female customer at a nearby café approached the police force and confronted them for using excessive force. The woman's verbal protest was promptly cut short by a violent kick from one of the riot police officers; the incident was filmed on camera by a BMFTV camera crew and the footage was uploaded to YouTube (shown below). In addition to the video footage, the precise moment at which the riot police officer raised one of his legs was also captured on camera by French freelance photojournalist Jan Schmidt-Whitley, who promptly uploaded the image to his Facebook page[1], along with a backstory describing the circumstances leading up to the incident (shown below).

For the first time console gamers could save the game at any point and return to it later. Games were no longer limited to a race-to-the-finish style delivery.

Upon its airing in late April 2016, the scene drew criticism from the fans for incorporating outdated memes, as well as spawning an exploitable meme based on a blank template of Bubble's face. The scene was originally featured in the 11th episode of Cartoon Network's Powerpuff Girls titled Tiara Trouble[1], which aired on April 15th, 2016. In the episode, Bubbles gets groomed by her sisters Blossom and Buttercup for Townsville's beauty pageant, but amidst the growing pressures from her sisters to win the contest, Bubbles refuses to go along with their plan and yells ""no me gusta!"" with a look that resembles the ""NO"" face, both of which are well-known instances of the rage comic memeplex. That same day, YouTuber DiscordDiscord uploaded a clip of the scene, garnering over 150,000 views and more than 4,100 dislikes (as of April 26th, 2016). Following the airing of the episode, the scene quickly prompted backlash from some fans who apparently misinterpreted Bubbles' face as an anti-semitic caricature due to its depiction of a prominent nose, as well as some meme elitists who criticized the production team's appropriation of Internet meme culture and the incongruous pairing of the phrase ""no me gusta"" and Bubble's ""NO"" facial expression, which are considered two distinct memes within the rage comic universe (show below, right).","['ppg', 'photoshop', 'reboot', 'bubbles', 'exploitable', 'me gusta', 'no', 'rage comic', 'the powerpuff girls', 'memeplex', 'discorddiscord', 'men_cant_be_raped', 'sym-pho-geah']",2016,2021-04-18,[],[],both

In memes, the quote appears in a variety of ways, such as image macros, YouTube poops and other formats. The original full phrase ""Our men are running from the battlefield!

Since the probability of at least one unit routing every battle was extremely high, players were likely to hear this phrase at least once a match and the announcer's heavy Japanese accent further fueled the phrase into becoming a meme.

The original image was taken by Reuters photographer Jasper Juinen just before the 2002 UEFA final.[2] Before the match, there was a moment of silence for the controversial Dutch Politician Pim Fortuyn.[1] Fortuyn, an outspoken critic of Islam, had been assassinated two days prior. German fans objected to the moment silence. Many Dutch fans, including Wilson, reacted by flipping the bird.

Created and written by American cartoonist Bil Keane, The Family Circus[1] debuted on February 28th, 1960. The comic centers around Bil, Thelma, and their four children: Billy, Dolly, Jeffy, and P.J.. The strip's parental characters are based on the author and his wife, Thelma. Having appeared in 1,500 newspapers over the past four decades, it is considered one of the most widely syndicated cartoon panel in the world. Anonymous artists and fans of The Family Circus have been making parodies of the original comic since as early as in 1989 allegedly distributed through anonymous networks of chain mails, nightclubs or coffee houses in America/Europe. They could also be acquired through mail or fax[9] to people who requested copies via Usenet groups. These parodies consisted of imitative illustrations and altered captions, often discussing adult-only topics and serious vices like adultery, drug abuse, animal cruelty and cannibalism. In 1992, Brian Boling was attributed as creating a cut and paste zine compilation of DFC images for his friends[2].

The caption ""me gusta"" translates to ""I like it"" in Spanish. In its beginning, the phrase conveyed an odd sense of pleasure in sexually perverse contexts, but the meaning has since broadened to describe a more general state of being disturbed and/or pleased at the same time. The original illustration was created by May Oswald in early 2010. The colloquial Spanish phrase ""me gusta"" was first adopted into a Rage Comic drawing by illustrator May Oswald (formerly known as Matt), who uploaded her artwork to 4chan [5] and Reddit [6] on March 18th, 2010. The drawing was also uploaded to her personal Tumblr blog[3] and DeviantART[4] account. During our interview with Oswald on May 6th, 2021, she revealed that the original post to 4chan was a carefully constructed effort to get the meme to go viral, which she did by posting examples of the face in memes from various accounts and IP addresses.[13] Here was the plan. Oftentimes, when a new Rage Face was coming out in 4chan at that time, how the thread would happen is that there would just be the face, and then with the colorful language of 4chan, there would be the equivalent of, ""Hey, new Rage Face just dropped. See what you guys can make of it."" So my intention was to do the exact same thing, ""Hey, new Rage Face just dropped."" Post the image. But what I came in with was that I had made about two or three example comics to kind of get it out there with sort of what I was intending this face to be used for. The first meme featuring Me Gusta after Oswald's initial post to 4chan used the character in a four-panel comic with a cat reacting to being pet, which Oswald revealed in our interview was actually a meme she made herself (shown below).

The image of Guevara was taken by Cuban photographer Alberto Korda on March 5th, 1960, while attending a memorial service for victims of the La Coubre explosion in Havana, Cuba. According to historical accounts, Che briefly made a public appearance during the service, at which point Korda snapped just two frames of Che from a distance of about 25 to 30 feet before the guerrilla leader disappeared from sight. However, Korda's photo remained unpublished for seven years and he kept a cropped version of the original photo for his private collection. The photograph was then acquired by a wealthy Italian publisher and intellectual by the name of Giangiacomo Feltrinelli in 1967. Feltrinelli had just returned from Bolivia where he had hoped his fame would help in negotiating the release of French journalist and professor, Régis Debray. Debray was arrested because it was believed that he was in connection with guerrilla operations led by Che Guevara. As Guevara's eventual capture and/or death seemed to be imminent with the CIA closing in on his whereabouts, Feltrinelli acquired the rights to publish Che's captured Bolivian Diary. At this time, Feltrinelli asked Cuban officials where he could obtain portraits of Guevara. He was directed to Korda's studio where he presented a letter of introduction from the government. The document asked for Korda's assistance in finding a good portrait of Che. Korda immediately knew that his favorite image of Che was perfect and pointed to the 1960 shot of Che hanging on the wall, saying that the photo was the best of those he had taken of Che. Feltrinelli agreed and ordered 2 prints. When the rich Itallian returned the following day to acquire the copies, Korda told him that the man did not have to pay, for he was a friend of the Revolution. When Feltrinelli returned to Italy, he created thousands of copies of the poster to raise awareness of Che's precarious situation and impending demise. Later, in 1968, after Che was executed, Che's Bolivian Diary with Korda's photo on the cover was released worldwide. Feltrinelli also created posters to promote the book, which sold over 1 million copies. By this time, Korda's image had officially entered the public consciousness. Through Feltrinelli's actions, the picture had become famous. As a life-long communist and supporter of the Cuban revolution, Alberto Korda claimed no payment for his picture. Even though many parodies and imitations of the portrait were reproduced on a mass scale for decades, Korda never asked for anything in return. Korda reasoned that Che's image represented his revolutionary ideals, and thus the more his picture spread the greater the chance Che's ideals would spread as well. However, Korda did not want commercialization of the image in relation to products he believed Guevara would not support, especially alcohol. This belief was displayed for the first time in 2000, when Smirnoff used Che's picture in a vodka commercial. Korda sued Lowe Lintas and Rex Features, the company that supplied the photograph to the vodka distillery. Lintas and Rex retorted that the image was in the public domain. The final result was an out of court settlement for 50,000 U.S. dollars to be given to Korda, which the photographer, in turn, donated to the Cuban health care system. However, he was not against its propagation altogether, telling reporters:","['image macro', 'exploitable', 'che', 'guevara', 'photo', 'photograph', 'guerrillero', 'heroico', 'heroic', 'guerrilla', 'revloution', 'revolucion', 'alberto', 'korda', 'jim', 'fitzpatrick', 'poster', 'marxist', 'marxism', 'guerrillero heroico', 'protest']",1967,2019-11-05,[],[],both

First appearing on the show in 2001, it gained memetic popularity for its ability to hypnotize people into a trance-like state of its own bidding. In memes, Hypnotoad is typically used as an interruptor in image macros alongside the catchphrase ""All glory to the Hypnotoad,"" implying that someone has succumbed to its control. Various elements, particularly the eyes, are also frequently used in Photoshop edits to imply Hypnotoad's mind-controlling abilities having an effect on either the viewer or a subject in the meme. This usage is similar to the related meme Candlejack. Hypnotoad originally appeared on Futurama in the episode ""The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,"" which aired on February 18th, 2001.[1] In the clip, Hypnotoad uses his hypnotic abilities to herd a flock of sheep and impress the judges of a dog show, only to then use his hypnosis to win and force the crowd to clap for him in robotic unison (seen below). The sound Hypnotoad makes while using his power is a recording of a turbine engine played backward.[3] The most commonly used image of Hypnotoad found in memes comes from the parody show Everybody Loves Hypnotoad, a spoof of Everybody Loves Raymond, where Hypnotoad is seen staring into the camera while seated atop a lily pad as he hypnotizes viewers into enjoying his program (shown below).[2] It is unknown exactly who first posted a meme featuring Hypnotoad, but most of the oldest examples date back to the late 2000s in the form of a basic Advice-Animals-like image macro with the character appearing alongside the caption ""All glory to the Hypnotoad.""","['futurama', 'toad', 'animals', 'interruptor', 'tv', 'blacklist', 'catchphrase', 'cartoons', 'pop culture', 'mind control', 'hypnotize', 'frog', 'character', 'all hail the hypnotoad', 'alien', 'meme', 'photoshop']",2001,2021-02-20,"['catchphrase', 'character', 'fan-art', 'photoshop', 'pop-culture-reference']",[],both
