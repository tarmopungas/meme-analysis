# meme-analysis
Meme analysis project as part of BSc thesis.

_extraction.ipynb_ contains a tool for selecting data from a Know Your Meme dataset and saving the selection as a csv-file.

_exploration.ipynb_ contains visualizations and exploration of the same data.

To run the notebooks, you need to download data from https://meme4.science/ and add the downloaded files to the "data" folder.
