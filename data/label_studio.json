Many online have pointed out that the placement of the bump makes it appear as though the kid-friendly cartoon character has an erection. The most popular iteration of Donald Duck boner, in which Donald stands up-right with his blue hat on, comes from a frame near end of the Disney animated anthology film Saludos Amigos, released August 24th, 1942.[9] During the segment \"Aquarela do Brasil\" (shown below), Donald swallows a bee, and as the bee moves throughout his body, it pushes up against Donald's stomach, creating a bump that resembles an erection. While Donald Duck has been part of the Disney canon since 1934, the earliest known example of the infamous picture of him with a supposed erection online appeared on the helli6n wordpress on August 2nd, 2010.[1] The image has since been removed, but less than a month later, on September 6th, the image (shown below) appeared on Funnyjunk with a watermark from 4gifs.com, meaning it likely dates back farther. Another variation, in which Donald is lying on his back, is a still from the Disney animated short Wide Open Spaces, released September 12th, 1947. In the film, Donald attempts to sleep outside on an air mattress. However, a rock underneath his mattress pushes all the way through his body, creating a bump in his stomach that looks like an erection.","tags":"['donald duck', 'disney', 'dolan', 'boner', 'sex', 'penis', 'erection', 'helli6n', 'wide open spaces', 'crosssockdance', 'mcdrawrhumperdink', 'mickey mouse']","year":1940.0,"last_update_source":"2021-05-11","other_types":"[]","imgflip":"['https:\/\/imgflip.com\/memegenerator\/80696816\/donald-duck-boner']"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-04-01T08:17:14.304974Z","updated_at":"2022-04-07T11:42:30.059630Z","project":1,"updated_by":2},{"id":416,"annotations":[{"id":482,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":18,"text":"Art Gallery Puking","labels":["Meme"]},"id":"5J_8ScY-6r","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":41,"end":49,"text":"reaction","labels":["MemeType"]},"id":"qOPXKkjY8C","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":61,"end":72,"text":"exploitable","labels":["MemeType"]},"id":"bmqv0E_bsT","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":147,"end":163,"text":" express disgust","labels":["Meaning"]},"id":"k9l7D7-JpA","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":185,"end":222,"text":"convey opinions on different pictures","labels":["Meaning"]},"id":"le0_xqYRm9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-04-07T11:42:02.429600Z","updated_at":"2022-04-07T11:42:02.429653Z","lead_time":18.866,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":416,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"3bb9612c-reaction.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"url":"https:\/\/knowyourmeme.com\/memes\/art-gallery-puking","template_image_url":"https:\/\/i.kym-cdn.com\/entries\/icons\/original\/000\/023\/392\/artgallery.jpg","about_origin":"Art Gallery Puking refers to a series of reaction images and exploitables of a man throwing up at an art gallery.

While the slang term is believed to have been used by developers since as early as the mid-to-late 2000s, it entered the general lexicon of online coding communities during the early 2010s, particularly on the code repository hosting service Github. While the story behind the coinage of LGTM remains murky at best, the earliest known use and explanation of the acronym can be traced to a feature summary of Google Mondrian, a peer-review software application for programmers, posted by Niall Kennedy[3] on November 30th, 2006. In explaining the most common method of peer-review, Kennedy mentions how reviewers would typically type in \"LGTM\" to express their approval, especially when communicating via email. Previous to Mondrian code review was conducted largely over e-mail using Google command-line wrappers built on top of Perforce. A developer could initiate a code review from within the g4 mail tool, which would fire off an e-mail and begin a review thread. When the developer receives a response of “looks good to me,” or lgtm for short, they could proceed to checkin.","tags":"['github', 'review', 'approval', 'lg', 'life is good', 'trademark', 'tm', 'looks good to me', 'acronym', 'internet slang', 'programmer']","year":2008.0,"last_update_source":"2019-10-30","other_types":"['hashtag', 'image-macro', 'slang']","imgflip":"[]"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-04-01T08:17:14.304398Z","updated_at":"2022-04-07T11:34:43.556221Z","project":1,"updated_by":2},{"id":372,"annotations":[{"id":468,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":9,"text":"Hypnotoad","labels":["Meme"]},"id":"zLaGpaS0jJ","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":283,"end":305,"text":"used as an interruptor","labels":["Meaning"]},"id":"MQ2QTBCnMR","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":378,"end":428,"text":"implying that someone has succumbed to its control","labels":["Meaning"]},"id":"_N9OnYZe_m","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":309,"end":320,"text":"image macro","labels":["MemeType"]},"id":"7tEuDQlh1y","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-04-07T11:34:20.924373Z","updated_at":"2022-04-07T11:34:20.924411Z","lead_time":39.939,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":372,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"73735ef0-exploitable.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"url":"https:\/\/knowyourmeme.com\/memes\/hypnotoad","template_image_url":"https:\/\/i.kym-cdn.com\/entries\/icons\/original\/000\/000\/262\/Hypnotoad_banner.jpg","about_origin":"Hypnotoad refers to a large, toad-like alien originating from the animated television series Futurama. First appearing on the show in 2001, it gained memetic popularity for its ability to hypnotize people into a trance-like state of its own bidding. In memes, Hypnotoad is typically used as an interruptor in image macros alongside the catchphrase \"All glory to the Hypnotoad,\" implying that someone has succumbed to its control. Various elements, particularly the eyes, are also frequently used in Photoshop edits to imply Hypnotoad's mind-controlling abilities having an effect on either the viewer or a subject in the meme. This usage is similar to the related meme Candlejack. Hypnotoad originally appeared on Futurama in the episode \"The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,\" which aired on February 18th, 2001.[1] In the clip, Hypnotoad uses his hypnotic abilities to herd a flock of sheep and impress the judges of a dog show, only to then use his hypnosis to win and force the crowd to clap for him in robotic unison (seen below). The sound Hypnotoad makes while using his power is a recording of a turbine engine played backward.[3] The most commonly used image of Hypnotoad found in memes comes from the parody show Everybody Loves Hypnotoad, a spoof of Everybody Loves Raymond, where Hypnotoad is seen staring into the camera while seated atop a lily pad as he hypnotizes viewers into enjoying his program (shown below).[2] It is unknown exactly who first posted a meme featuring Hypnotoad, but most of the oldest examples date back to the late 2000s in the form of a basic Advice-Animals-like image macro with the character appearing alongside the caption \"All glory to the Hypnotoad.\"","tags":"['futurama', 'toad', 'animals', 'interruptor', 'tv', 'blacklist', 'catchphrase', 'cartoons', 'pop culture', 'mind control', 'hypnotize', 'frog', 'character', 'all hail the hypnotoad', 'alien', 'meme', 'photoshop']","year":2001.0,"last_update_source":"2021-02-20","other_types":"['catchphrase', 'character', 'fan-art', 'photoshop', 'pop-culture-reference']","imgflip":"[]"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-04-01T08:16:58.395866Z","updated_at":"2022-04-07T11:34:20.989169Z","project":1,"updated_by":2},{"id":312,"annotations":[{"id":467,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":16,"text":"Ooh Mister Darcy","labels":["Meme"]},"id":"080Y_EPVnM","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":23,"end":34,"text":"exploitable","labels":["MemeType"]},"id":"SUOW25lSZz","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-04-07T11:33:39.643567Z","updated_at":"2022-04-07T11:33:39.643603Z","lead_time":18.794,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":312,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"73735ef0-exploitable.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"url":"https:\/\/knowyourmeme.com\/memes\/ooh-mister-darcy","template_image_url":"https:\/\/i.kym-cdn.com\/entries\/icons\/original\/000\/005\/819\/ooh_mr__darcy_animation_by_venusadept_chance-d3fpllc.png.jpg","about_origin":"Ooh Mister Darcy is an exploitable comic series based off a webcomic by artist Kate Beaton.

In the comic, Toon Link is shown posing in this excited manner after he and Solid Snake decide to sneak around other characters to visit Ganondorf in the hospital.","tags":"['4chan', 'fsjal', 'anticipation', 'eager', 'original content', 'comic', 'exploitable', 'drawing fad', 'g00dguyz', 'brian lee']","year":2009.0,"last_update_source":"2021-04-28","other_types":"[]","imgflip":"[]"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-04-01T08:16:58.395217Z","updated_at":"2022-04-07T10:58:53.729551Z","project":1,"updated_by":2},{"id":364,"annotations":[{"id":428,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":17,"text":"It's Machine Code","labels":["Meme"]},"id":"n_ivjYzSyi","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":286,"end":297,"text":"exploitable","labels":["MemeType"]},"id":"f8H21TNtzs","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-04-07T10:58:43.851036Z","updated_at":"2022-04-07T10:58:43.851072Z","lead_time":17.964,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":364,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"73735ef0-exploitable.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"url":"https:\/\/knowyourmeme.com\/memes\/it-s-machine-code","template_image_url":"https:\/\/i.kym-cdn.com\/entries\/icons\/original\/000\/000\/559\/iconric.jpg","about_origin":"It's Machine Code is a comic\/panel-based meme that involves DC Comics character Doctor Will Magnus looking at a paper and reacting to the content that is presented on the paper.

The image of Guevara was taken by Cuban photographer Alberto Korda on March 5th, 1960, while attending a memorial service for victims of the La Coubre explosion in Havana, Cuba. According to historical accounts, Che briefly made a public appearance during the service, at which point Korda snapped just two frames of Che from a distance of about 25 to 30 feet before the guerrilla leader disappeared from sight. However, Korda's photo remained unpublished for seven years and he kept a cropped version of the original photo for his private collection. The photograph was then acquired by a wealthy Italian publisher and intellectual by the name of Giangiacomo Feltrinelli in 1967. Feltrinelli had just returned from Bolivia where he had hoped his fame would help in negotiating the release of French journalist and professor, Régis Debray. Debray was arrested because it was believed that he was in connection with guerrilla operations led by Che Guevara. As Guevara's eventual capture and\/or death seemed to be imminent with the CIA closing in on his whereabouts, Feltrinelli acquired the rights to publish Che's captured Bolivian Diary. At this time, Feltrinelli asked Cuban officials where he could obtain portraits of Guevara. He was directed to Korda's studio where he presented a letter of introduction from the government. The document asked for Korda's assistance in finding a good portrait of Che. Korda immediately knew that his favorite image of Che was perfect and pointed to the 1960 shot of Che hanging on the wall, saying that the photo was the best of those he had taken of Che. Feltrinelli agreed and ordered 2 prints. When the rich Itallian returned the following day to acquire the copies, Korda told him that the man did not have to pay, for he was a friend of the Revolution. When Feltrinelli returned to Italy, he created thousands of copies of the poster to raise awareness of Che's precarious situation and impending demise. Later, in 1968, after Che was executed, Che's Bolivian Diary with Korda's photo on the cover was released worldwide. Feltrinelli also created posters to promote the book, which sold over 1 million copies. By this time, Korda's image had officially entered the public consciousness. Through Feltrinelli's actions, the picture had become famous. As a life-long communist and supporter of the Cuban revolution, Alberto Korda claimed no payment for his picture. Even though many parodies and imitations of the portrait were reproduced on a mass scale for decades, Korda never asked for anything in return. Korda reasoned that Che's image represented his revolutionary ideals, and thus the more his picture spread the greater the chance Che's ideals would spread as well. However, Korda did not want commercialization of the image in relation to products he believed Guevara would not support, especially alcohol. This belief was displayed for the first time in 2000, when Smirnoff used Che's picture in a vodka commercial. Korda sued Lowe Lintas and Rex Features, the company that supplied the photograph to the vodka distillery. Lintas and Rex retorted that the image was in the public domain. The final result was an out of court settlement for 50,000 U.S. dollars to be given to Korda, which the photographer, in turn, donated to the Cuban health care system. However, he was not against its propagation altogether, telling reporters:","tags":"['image macro', 'exploitable', 'che', 'guevara', 'photo', 'photograph', 'guerrillero', 'heroico', 'heroic', 'guerrilla', 'revloution', 'revolucion', 'alberto', 'korda', 'jim', 'fitzpatrick', 'poster', 'marxist', 'marxism', 'guerrillero heroico', 'protest']","year":1967.0,"last_update_source":"2019-11-05","other_types":"[]","imgflip":"[]"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-04-01T08:16:58.394529Z","updated_at":"2022-04-07T10:57:02.435956Z","project":1,"updated_by":2},{"id":357,"annotations":[{"id":421,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":13,"text":"Approval Guy ","labels":["Meme"]},"id":"sSWC4a5K5f","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":186,"end":236,"text":"indicate one's approval of another post or comment","labels":["Meaning"]},"id":"FVHNk4Ob75","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-04-07T10:55:52.595132Z","updated_at":"2022-04-07T10:55:52.595166Z","lead_time":21.011,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":357,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"73735ef0-exploitable.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"url":"https:\/\/knowyourmeme.com\/memes\/approval-guy","template_image_url":"https:\/\/i.kym-cdn.com\/entries\/icons\/original\/000\/000\/804\/approval-guy.jpg","about_origin":"Approval Guy is a photoshop meme that stems from a photo of a man giving a thumbs up while attending a lingerie party.

At one point, Aragorn asks Legolas \"what do your elf eyes see?\" since elves in Middle-earth have better vision than other races, which is where the quote used in memes comes from (shown below).

This yell was also added in the 2011 Blu-Ray version of the movie Return of the Jedi.

He is then informed by Sith Lord Darth Sidious about the consequences of his rage when he inadvertently killed Padme (seen below). On May 20th, 2005, the YTMND user Redily[7] created the YTMND \"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!\"[8] which depicted a still from the newly released Episode III, along with the sound byte of Darth Vader saying the phrase \"Nooooo!\" Since then, the site has accumulated over one million views and been inducted into the YTMND Hall of Fame.

The still-shots of Kurt Cobain playing the guitar on stage were taken from the video footage of Nirvana's 1993 MTV Unplugged in New York[1] session, specifically during the band's cover performance of \"Where Did You Sleep Last Night\" (shown below). Recorded and taped at Sony Studios in New York City on November 18th, 1993, Nirvana's MTV Unplugged session was aired on December 14th, 1993, followed by the release of the live album on November 1st, 1994, only months after Cobain was found dead at his home in April that year.

It is a mangled Engrish way of saying \"Shameful Display\" used to insult another player's poor tactics in the game, later becoming a phrase used for other video game titles when someone failed. In memes, the quote appears in a variety of ways, such as image macros, YouTube poops and other formats. The original full phrase \"Our men are running from the battlefield! Shameful display!\" is said by your virtual advisor in the game Total War: Shogun 2, released March 15th, 2011, whenever one of your units loses their morale and routs from the battlefield. The first reference to this was uploaded by YouTuber[4] DinhLilium on March 20th, 2011, receiving over 329,000 views, 2,600 likes and 260 comments in roughly 10 years (shown below). Since the probability of at least one unit routing every battle was extremely high, players were likely to hear this phrase at least once a match and the announcer's heavy Japanese accent further fueled the phrase into becoming a meme. The most likely origin point for this phrase is the \/v\/ forums of 4chan. The first instance of the \"shamefur dispray\" version comes from a post on March 16th, 2011, when a \/v\/ board user commented in a Shogun 2 general thread and mocked the difficulty that the original poster was playing in the game (seen below).[1]","tags":"['\/v\/', 'shogun 2', 'total war', 'mispronunciation', 'shameful display', 'gaming', 'video games', 'meme', 'engrish', 'catchphrase', 'sound effect', 'exploitable', 'quote', 'creative assembly', 'dinhlilium', 'kaiserhawk', 'wiiwad', 'togo igawa', 'the last samurai', 'qitiandashengyeye', 'grorious d']","year":2011.0,"last_update_source":"2021-03-22","other_types":"['catchphrase', 'pop-culture-reference', 'sound-effect']","imgflip":"[]"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-04-01T08:16:58.175599Z","updated_at":"2022-04-07T10:47:05.513848Z","project":1,"updated_by":2},{"id":305,"annotations":[{"id":402,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":8,"text":"Brazzers","labels":["Meme"]},"id":"Hj8ooKQ-2w","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":122,"end":287,"text":"superimposing the logo of the porn site over a group photo depicting two or more subjects to make it seem as if the image had been screen-captured from an adult film","labels":["Meaning"]},"id":"lT541paGW5","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-04-07T10:46:32.896586Z","updated_at":"2022-04-07T10:46:32.896634Z","lead_time":210.072,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":305,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"73735ef0-exploitable.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"url":"https:\/\/knowyourmeme.com\/memes\/brazzers","template_image_url":"https:\/\/i.kym-cdn.com\/entries\/icons\/original\/000\/007\/747\/naughty-memes-logo.jpg","about_origin":"Brazzers, not to be confused with the eponymous adult entertainment production company, is a photoshop meme that involves superimposing the logo of the porn site over a group photo depicting two or more subjects to make it seem as if the image had been screen-captured from an adult film.

The original quote can be found in Skyrim, released November 11th, 2011, when interacting with guards after a Saadia-aligned completion of the \"In My Time of Need\" quest, after which a pair of mercenaries from Hammerfell will be present at or nearby the entrances to every major city in Skyrim, most noticeably in Whiterun. When the player passes a city guard while the mercenaries are present, the guard may comment on the mercs' scimitars. The often-repeated phrase was first uploaded to YouTube[1] on November 28th, 2011, by user Mucks and is the earliest known reference to the quote. The video (shown below) received over 247,000 views, 3,000 likes and 700 comments in roughly nine years. \"You see those warriors from Hammerfell? They've got curved swords. Curved.

The image of CM Punk being unimpressed is a screengrab from the Aug. 1, 2011 episode of WWE Monday Night Raw. While Triple H was in the ring with Punk, and trying to impress Punk with what a magnanimous businessman he is, Punk cast an aside glance at the camera to let the audience at home know that he, indeed, was not impressed. CM Punk would duplicate his \"Not Impressed\" look on the Jan. 30th 2012 Episode of WWE Monday Night Raw. In this case, Punk is reacting to Johny Ace extending his hand.

It's also used in Rage Comics as a reaction to proceeding captions, as well as being used as an exploitable where it is photoshopped to include elements from other pop culture references. The original scene that the image comes from takes place in American Psyco, released on April 14th, 2000.[1] In one of the scenes, Bateman uses an axe to kill one of his victims, which is where the still used in the meme comes from (shown below).[2] Although the exact first meme using the scene is unknown, a reverse image search on TinEye,[3] shows that it first appeared online February 5th, 2008, on the site Taringa[4] but has since been deleted.

The actual use of the phrase \"YEEEAAAHHH!\" didn't begin until YouTuber \"MrQuick927\" posted the following comment:","tags":"['csi', 'characters', '4 pane', 'tv', 'youtube', 'comic', 'exploitable', 'david caruso', 'horatio caine', 'mrquick927']","year":2006.0,"last_update_source":"2021-04-07","other_types":"[]","imgflip":"['https:\/\/imgflip.com\/memegenerator\/3793866\/CSI-4']"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-04-01T08:16:58.175075Z","updated_at":"2022-04-07T10:37:35.965819Z","project":1,"updated_by":2},{"id":291,"annotations":[{"id":388,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":12,"text":"\"First Date\"","labels":["Meme"]},"id":"aWDcjjZsaP","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":19,"end":30,"text":"exploitable","labels":["MemeType"]},"id":"ltCgIm_uhY","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":45,"end":87,"text":"used in various situations of a first date","labels":["Meaning"]},"id":"m5zy_BWVOe","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-04-07T10:36:36.040969Z","updated_at":"2022-04-07T10:36:36.040998Z","lead_time":43.679,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":291,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"73735ef0-exploitable.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"url":"https:\/\/knowyourmeme.com\/memes\/first-date","template_image_url":"https:\/\/i.kym-cdn.com\/entries\/icons\/original\/000\/011\/998\/574818_403844769694484_1858036751_n.jpg","about_origin":"\"First Date\" is an exploitable comic that is used in various situations of a first date, ending with the boy and\/or the girl alone, regretful, laughing and\/or having sex.

Typically, these appear as image macros with variations of the caption “At first I was like X, but then I was like X,” with two related images depicting different facial expressions split into two panels. There are many variations of the setup, which sometimes displays the same image twice for irony. The exact origins of this meme are unknown, but it is believed to have originated sometime around 2004. One such early example was posted on April 5th, 2004, in a thread on the My350Z[1] forums by user 12SecZ, who used the phrasal template alongside emoticons to show their reaction (seen below, left). Another early template setup using the phrase in a meme format included the caption \"At first I was like, but then I lol'd.\" On May 27th, 2007, MyConfinedSpace[2] user Panzer posted one such example, receiving 24 votes and a 4.5 out of 5 rating in roughly 14 years (seen below, right).","tags":"[\"serious'd\", \"lol'd\", 'image macro', 'reaction image', 'at first i was like', 'but then i was like', 'snowclone', 'phrasal template', 'meme', 'catchphrase', 'reaction']","year":2004.0,"last_update_source":"2021-05-12","other_types":"['catchphrase', 'image-macro', 'snowclone']","imgflip":"[]"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-04-01T08:17:14.313418Z","updated_at":"2022-04-07T09:51:08.460649Z","project":1,"updated_by":2},{"id":507,"annotations":[{"id":378,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":26,"text":"What Do Your Elf Eyes See?","labels":["Meme"]},"id":"9Evkmpl6u1","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":92,"end":103,"text":"exploitable","labels":["MemeType"]},"id":"-ux1m6Vyg1","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":104,"end":115,"text":"image macro","labels":["MemeType"]},"id":"KHe2OMX_A6","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":298,"end":307,"text":" reaction","labels":["MemeType"]},"id":"0midlOG1fv","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-04-07T09:50:18.287047Z","updated_at":"2022-04-07T09:50:18.287085Z","lead_time":26.735,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":507,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"3bb9612c-reaction.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"url":"https:\/\/knowyourmeme.com\/memes\/what-do-your-elf-eyes-see","template_image_url":"https:\/\/i.kym-cdn.com\/entries\/icons\/original\/000\/000\/820\/Legolas_What_Do_Your_Elf_Eyes_See_banner.png","about_origin":"What Do Your Elf Eyes See?, sometimes written as Legolas! What Do Your Elf Eyes See?, is an exploitable image macro taken from the 2002 film The Lord Of The Rings The Two Towers that depicts Legolas overlooking a valley in Rohan while scanning for signs of the missing hobbits. The scene is used in reaction images and GIFs in addition to image macro memes. The original scene used in the meme comes from the second Lord of the Rings film, The Two Towers, which was released in theaters on December 18th, 2002. During a scene where Legolas, Aragorn and Gimili are chasing down a pack of Uruk-hai that previously captured the hobbits Merry and Pippin in the first movie, Aragorn and Legolas climb a rock outcrop to scan the valley. At one point, Aragorn asks Legolas \"what do your elf eyes see?\" since elves in Middle-earth have better vision than other races, which is where the quote used in memes comes from (shown below). The actual origin of the image used in memes is uncertain, however, the oldest known instance of it appeared on October 14th, 2006, when Facepunch[1] forum member Zeldy created a thread titled \"Legolas! What do your elf-eyes see?\" The thread resulted in many new images made, spanned 11 pages over the course of about a year (examples shown below).[2] This three-panel format became the most widespread use of the scene early on.","tags":"['lord of the rings', 'exploitable', 'funny', 'image', 'legolas', 'reaction', 'image macro', 'reaction gif', 'the two towers', 'aragorn', 'meme']","year":2002.0,"last_update_source":"2021-05-06","other_types":"['exploitable', 'image-macro', 'pop-culture-reference']","imgflip":"['https:\/\/imgflip.com\/meme\/16305130\/Legolas-elf-eyes']"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-04-01T08:17:14.313366Z","updated_at":"2022-04-07T09:50:18.350316Z","project":1,"updated_by":2},{"id":506,"annotations":[{"id":377,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":8,"text":"Fuck Yea","labels":["Meme"]},"id":"L44-MgummE","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":173,"end":202,"text":"illustrate triumphant moments","labels":["Meaning"]},"id":"b2SQvfVImO","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-04-07T09:49:50.538988Z","updated_at":"2022-04-07T09:49:50.539023Z","lead_time":15.745,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":506,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"3bb9612c-reaction.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"url":"https:\/\/knowyourmeme.com\/memes\/fuck-yea","template_image_url":"https:\/\/i.kym-cdn.com\/entries\/icons\/original\/000\/001\/987\/FuckYEA.jpg","about_origin":"Fuck Yea is a series of four-pane cartoon strips featuring a stick figure looking complacent and confident.

The action conveys a message of dismay and is often a reaction toward someone's momentary lapse of logic, judgement, or memory. This reaction may be directed toward another person or be self-deprecating. Online, people post images, GIFs and videos of people performing the motion to express embarrassment towards someone else's actions. The facepalm, as an expression, has existed long before the internet in both human and non-human societies. For example, a 1896 statue entitled \"Caïn\" by Henri Vidal, which resides in Tuileries Garden, Paris, France, was unveiled in 1896 (shown below, left).[1] One of the most famous and widely used variations of the facepalm comes from an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation, which first aired on February 5th, 1990. The clip shows the character Captain Jean-Luc Picard (played by Patrick Stewart) reacting to a stressful situation by placing his hand on his face (shown below, right). The website Word Spy[2] cites a 2001 message board as the earliest usage of the expression. However, the actual post is no longer available. Therefore, the earliest available usage of the phrase online was posted on February 10th, 2004 by Urban Dictionary [3] user Moondog. They defined the action, \"The act of dropping one's face \/ forehead into one's hand. Usually accompanied by a 'thunk' or a cr a cry of 'D'oh!'

It has also become closely associated with the phrase \"I Seriously Hope You Guys Don’t Do This\" (ISHYGDDT). Origin: The still shot of George Constanza was taken from the 143rd episode of the American TV sitcom Seinfeld titled “The Abstinence,”[2] which originally aired on November 21st, 1996.

Constanza responds to Jeter with a smug smile while preparing to swing his bat, coyly replying “Yeah… in six games.” According to Encyclopedia Dramatica[8], the image was first used on 4chan’s \/sp\/ (sports) board in combination with “>putting ketchup in the fridge,”[9] a greentext phrase used to imply that an activity or choice is abnormal, sometime in early 2011.","tags":"['george', '4chan', 'o rly', 'implying', '>implying', 'reaction face', 'costanza', 'seinfeld', 'disapproval', 'contempt', 'sitcom', 'baseball']","year":2011.0,"last_update_source":"2021-05-02","other_types":"[]","imgflip":"[]"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-04-01T08:17:14.313062Z","updated_at":"2022-04-07T09:45:22.067810Z","project":1,"updated_by":2},{"id":498,"annotations":[{"id":369,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":20,"text":"Are You Serious Face","labels":["Meme"]},"id":"rSNs9RIZyp","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":37,"end":47,"text":"Seriously?","labels":["Meme"]},"id":"LRcdZWRnTf","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":176,"end":223,"text":"reaction to overwhelming ignorance or stupidity","labels":["Meaning"]},"id":"2T6m2beB8v","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":176,"end":185,"text":"reaction ","labels":["MemeType"]},"id":"4UsiooOm_8","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-04-07T09:44:57.743725Z","updated_at":"2022-04-07T09:44:57.743765Z","lead_time":26.61,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":498,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"3bb9612c-reaction.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"url":"https:\/\/knowyourmeme.com\/memes\/are-you-serious-face-seriously","template_image_url":"https:\/\/i.kym-cdn.com\/entries\/icons\/original\/000\/005\/545\/ruserious.jpg","about_origin":"Are You Serious Face, also known as \"Seriously?\", is a black and white drawing of a perplexed looking man or woman that is often used in rage comics.

The image is often photoshopped to adapt to a particular subculture, and the phrase is often used in conversation without the image. On February 16th, 2012, the 30 Rock episode \"The Tuxedo Begins\" (season six, episode 8). In the show, actor Steve Buscemi plays Lenny Wosniak, a private detective hired as a strike buster.[1] In a scene where Wosniak is describing his prior investigations, he flashes back to a scene where he believes he successfully masqueraded as a high school student, parodying the TV show 21 Jump Street.[12] Buscemi, a 55-year-old at the time the episode aired, approaches a group of high school teens dress as a \"one of them.\" However, his grizzled appearance in contrast with his silly approximation of high school attire, which includes a backwards hat, a skateboard worn over his shoulder and a t-shirt that reads \"Music Band\" in the style of the classic AC\/DC logo, is indicative of his poor and obvious disguise. As he approaches, he says, \"How do you do, fellow kids?\" The catchphrase has since come to represent all egregious attempts at appealing to subcultures.","tags":"['steve buscemi', '30 rock', 'high school', 'private detective', 'blending in', 'tumblr', 'gif', 'reaction image', 'music band', 'three_am', 'dillonfbecker', 'urplescurple', 'bosoxdanc', 'kaitlyn tiffany']","year":2012.0,"last_update_source":"2021-04-26","other_types":"['catchphrase', 'photoshop']","imgflip":"['https:\/\/imgflip.com\/memegenerator\/58910635\/Steve-Buscemi-Fellow-Kids']"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-04-01T08:17:14.307802Z","updated_at":"2022-04-07T09:37:08.411487Z","project":1,"updated_by":2},{"id":456,"annotations":[{"id":356,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":13,"text":"\"Ow The Edge\"","labels":["Meme"]},"id":"nE-wIbyFWj","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":19,"end":30,"text":"catchphrase","labels":["MemeType"]},"id":"yWQySoF77T","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":19,"end":114,"text":"catchphrase used in response to images, videos or posts that seem to fit in the edgy stereotype","labels":["Meaning"]},"id":"-0ItbmOlTo","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-04-07T09:36:04.603819Z","updated_at":"2022-04-07T09:36:04.603874Z","lead_time":40.009,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":456,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"3bb9612c-reaction.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"url":"https:\/\/knowyourmeme.com\/memes\/ow-the-edge","template_image_url":"https:\/\/i.kym-cdn.com\/entries\/icons\/original\/000\/018\/681\/Ow_the_edge.jpg","about_origin":"\"Ow The Edge\" is a catchphrase used in response to images, videos or posts that seem to fit in the edgy stereotype.

As Meera Reed and Hodor prepare their escape, Meera asks Bran to warg, a form of mind-controlling, into Hodor's mind so that he can rescue his unconscious body out of the cave, which Bran obliges by warging into a younger version of Hodor, a cheerful stable boy then known as \"Wylis,\" in the past. As they flee their way out of the cave, Meera pleads Hodor to \"hold the door\" to buy her and Bran enough time to escape safely, a command that echoes through the past into Wylis' head and triggers him to lapse into a state of seizure and \"hold the door!\" over and over again.

But as they begin their conversation, the three businessmen suddenly get shot down in front of him and a man wearing body armor enters the room to fire at the \"snipers\" outside. Kato falls to the floor in panic and moments later, another man enters the room with a gun, puts it to his head and informs him that he'd been punked by the TV show.

[1] In the scene, character Bruno Buccellati (Bucciarati) is questioning main protagonist Giorno Giovanna if he knows what happened to character Leaky-Eye Luca, who was in critical condition at that time because of a previous encounter with Giorno. Despite denying that he met Luca, and apparently losing Bruno, Giorno realizes he was holding Luca's right eye the entire time and starts sweating nervously. Bruno then appears behind Giorno, licks the sweat off his cheek, and proclaims that the sweat tastes like that of a liar[2].","tags":"[\"jojo's bizarre adventure\", 'vento aureo', 'golden wind', 'giorno giovanna', 'bruno buccellati', 'bucciarati', 'lick', 'jjba', 'spy and engineer', 'c3t8cspazg']","year":1996.0,"last_update_source":"2021-04-06","other_types":"[]","imgflip":"[]"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-04-01T08:16:58.396734Z","updated_at":"2022-04-07T08:48:13.470130Z","project":1,"updated_by":2},{"id":380,"annotations":[{"id":316,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":13,"text":"Disaster Girl","labels":["Meme"]},"id":"0CYh0ga-32","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":46,"end":57,"text":"exploitable","labels":["MemeType"]},"id":"xMG2cAMJfs","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":58,"end":223,"text":"photo of a smiling girl is superimposed on to images of natural disasters and accidents to imply that she has caused some type of calamity depicted in the background","labels":["Meaning"]},"id":"f8RPnIZbrI","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-04-07T08:47:53.381326Z","updated_at":"2022-04-07T08:47:53.381375Z","lead_time":22.947,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":380,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"73735ef0-exploitable.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"url":"https:\/\/knowyourmeme.com\/memes\/disaster-girl","template_image_url":"https:\/\/i.kym-cdn.com\/entries\/icons\/original\/000\/000\/043\/disaster-girl.jpg","about_origin":"Disaster Girl is a photoshop meme in which an exploitable photo of a smiling girl is superimposed on to images of natural disasters and accidents to imply that she has caused some type of calamity depicted in the background.

It basically means that the one who posted this NSFW (Not safe for work pun here) content will eventually get busted at work doing it, be fired and that someone else will take his job, hence the promotion as some kind of \"wish\". That is to say, it's ironically used to say \"Stop posting NSFW content here before it got deleted or that someone will gain a promotion thank to you.\" The image macros are usually featuring someone who is triumphantly raising his arms and grinning in self-praise, with sometimes the \"promotion\" word underneath. As pointed out by that first quote: An user named Black_Knight gave a first glimpse of what will further be the meme by repeatedly posting on NSFW threads from SFW boards that he got fired because of stumbling upon the disturbing content which, contrary to do anything to help improving the situation, only egged trolls to post more explicit stuff. There is no traces to confirm that those events really took place as written however. Then, as said by LurkMore wiki as well: There where two primary attempts at creating a meme from the initial catchphrase that didn't catch on. After that, according to LurkMore once again, the meme really caught on 4chan's \/v\/ board around september 2006 when someone posted the picture of a middle-aged black male employee as a response with the \"Promotion\" word beside it. There is no 4chan archive from that exact period, sadly. The earliest mention of that picture in the Promotion meme comes from one of the initial photo's alteration, on a \/b\/ thread from May 2007.

The caption \"me gusta\" translates to \"I like it\" in Spanish. In its beginning, the phrase conveyed an odd sense of pleasure in sexually perverse contexts, but the meaning has since broadened to describe a more general state of being disturbed and\/or pleased at the same time. The original illustration was created by May Oswald in early 2010. The colloquial Spanish phrase \"me gusta\" was first adopted into a Rage Comic drawing by illustrator May Oswald (formerly known as Matt), who uploaded her artwork to 4chan [5] and Reddit [6] on March 18th, 2010. The drawing was also uploaded to her personal Tumblr blog[3] and DeviantART[4] account. During our interview with Oswald on May 6th, 2021, she revealed that the original post to 4chan was a carefully constructed effort to get the meme to go viral, which she did by posting examples of the face in memes from various accounts and IP addresses.[13] Here was the plan. Oftentimes, when a new Rage Face was coming out in 4chan at that time, how the thread would happen is that there would just be the face, and then with the colorful language of 4chan, there would be the equivalent of, \"Hey, new Rage Face just dropped. See what you guys can make of it.\" So my intention was to do the exact same thing, \"Hey, new Rage Face just dropped.\" Post the image. But what I came in with was that I had made about two or three example comics to kind of get it out there with sort of what I was intending this face to be used for. The first meme featuring Me Gusta after Oswald's initial post to 4chan used the character in a four-panel comic with a cat reacting to being pet, which Oswald revealed in our interview was actually a meme she made herself (shown below). Oswald eventually revealed herself as the creator of the Me Gusta face in a Reddit thread,[1] as well as an Ask Me Anything (AMA) thread[2] on March 8th, 2011.","tags":"['4chan', 'rageguy', 'spinoff', '4 panel comic', 'me gusta', 'megusta', 'roflcon iii', 'matt oswald', 'rage face', 'rage comics', 'may oswald']","year":2010.0,"last_update_source":"2021-05-12","other_types":"['character', 'image-macro']","imgflip":"['https:\/\/imgflip.com\/memegenerator\/49652394\/Me-Gusta']"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-04-01T08:16:58.176750Z","updated_at":"2022-04-07T08:09:38.593694Z","project":1,"updated_by":2},{"id":336,"annotations":[{"id":300,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":15,"text":"\"Here's Johnny\"","labels":["Meme"]},"id":"KHkMpGesAt","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":32,"end":71,"text":"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson","labels":["Meme"]},"id":"Pv60ZF71_U","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":441,"end":452,"text":"exploitable","labels":["MemeType"]},"id":"kqQ1-IcrVO","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":453,"end":464,"text":"image macro","labels":["MemeType"]},"id":"nPtkpn6kOk","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-04-07T08:09:16.277863Z","updated_at":"2022-04-07T08:09:16.277903Z","lead_time":32.436,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":336,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"73735ef0-exploitable.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"url":"https:\/\/knowyourmeme.com\/memes\/heres-johnny","template_image_url":"https:\/\/i.kym-cdn.com\/entries\/icons\/original\/000\/002\/361\/maxresdefault.jpg","about_origin":"\"Here's Johnny\" is a quote from The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, which aired from the 1962 to early 1992.

The trend peaked around 2009 and is still used over a decade later on occasion. In the anime series Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, the character Kamina, known for his manliness, wears a pair of red-tinted triangular glasses, which naturally became known as \"Kamina glasses,\" although he is not the first character to use the style of shades (character shown below). It's unknown when exactly web users began photoshopping Kamina's glasses onto other characters for comedic effect. The practice likely began in an anime forum about the show sometime in 2007. On August 23rd, 2007, Deviant Art[5] user T4R0K uploaded a piece of fan art showing the character Saber from the visual novel Fate\/stay night with Kamina glasses, garnering over 1,000 views in 14 years (shown below).","tags":"['tengen toppa gurren lagann', 'kamina', 'gar', 'gainax', 'triangle shades', 'glasses', 'sunglasses', 'epic', 'manly', 'photoshop', 'simon', 'exploitable', 'fan labor', 'anime']","year":2007.0,"last_update_source":"2021-04-08","other_types":"['fan-labor', 'photoshop', 'pop-culture-reference']","imgflip":"[]"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-04-01T08:16:58.176263Z","updated_at":"2022-04-07T07:57:02.526152Z","project":1,"updated_by":2},{"id":323,"annotations":[{"id":288,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":17,"text":"Middle Finger Kid","labels":["Meme"]},"id":"hqkv-aqDOz","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":24,"end":35,"text":"exploitable","labels":["MemeType"]},"id":"NlKXNCXT_s","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":36,"end":47,"text":"image macro","labels":["MemeType"]},"id":"H4MOebLRio","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":197,"end":234,"text":"show support for sports organizations","labels":["Meaning"]},"id":"_gFrr2GAgu","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":241,"end":311,"text":"express anger or resentment toward a particular person, group or thing","labels":["Meaning"]},"id":"EHqWsvdB4W","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-04-07T07:56:27.138993Z","updated_at":"2022-04-07T07:56:27.139032Z","lead_time":64.974,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":323,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"73735ef0-exploitable.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"url":"https:\/\/knowyourmeme.com\/memes\/middle-finger-kid","template_image_url":"https:\/\/i.kym-cdn.com\/entries\/icons\/original\/000\/003\/853\/Middle_Finger_Kid_Banner.jpg","about_origin":"Middle Finger Kid is an exploitable image macro depicting a young soccer fan yelling while extending his arm with a middle finger extended towards the air. In memes, the photo is typically used to show support for sports organizations or to express anger or resentment toward a particular person, group or thing and is often photoshopped to include various elements overlaid on top of the kid. The original photo used in the meme was taken during the UEFA final between Feyenoord Rotterdam of Netherlands and Borussia of Dortmund, Germany, on May 8th, 2002. The image of a young Feyenoord fan, later revealed to be 5-year-old Mikey Wilson, shows a boy showing support for his team, with his face painted white and red while wearing a Kappa soccer jersey, and a middle finger extended in animosity towards the opposing squad (shown below). The original image was taken by Reuters photographer Jasper Juinen just before the 2002 UEFA final.[2] Before the match, there was a moment of silence for the controversial Dutch Politician Pim Fortuyn.[1] Fortuyn, an outspoken critic of Islam, had been assassinated two days prior. German fans objected to the moment silence. Many Dutch fans, including Wilson, reacted by flipping the bird. The photo encapsulated the stereotypical image of the wild, die-hard, over-the-top fanaticism of European football hooligans. Although it appeared online at least as early as 2008, it was primarily used with the original, unaltered image in profile pictures or as a reaction image before it appeared as a meme. The exact first use of the viral image in meme form is unknown, but early examples appeared around 2010 (examples shown below, left and right).","tags":"['middle finger kid', 'middelvinger jongen', 'mikey wilson', 'image macro', 'exploitable', 'sports', 'soccer', 'uk', 'football', 'british', 'sports fan', 'character', 'meme', 'photoshop', 'jasper juinen', 'pim fortuyn', 'hooligans', 'yankees suck kid', 'harold reynolds']","year":2002.0,"last_update_source":"2021-05-12","other_types":"['character', 'image-macro', 'photoshop']","imgflip":"['https:\/\/imgflip.com\/meme\/10350665\/Baby-Pointing-Middle-Finger']"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-04-01T08:16:58.176226Z","updated_at":"2022-04-07T07:56:27.201925Z","project":1,"updated_by":2},{"id":322,"annotations":[{"id":287,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"start":15,"end":26,"text":"exploitable","labels":["MemeType"]},"id":"e7sZDctXda","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":93,"end":108,"text":"BIG MEATY CLAWS","labels":["Meme"]},"id":"ifrvr-ddXM","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-04-07T07:55:21.313943Z","updated_at":"2022-04-07T07:55:21.314003Z","lead_time":11.066,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":322,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"73735ef0-exploitable.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"url":"https:\/\/knowyourmeme.com\/memes\/big-meaty-claws","template_image_url":"https:\/\/i.kym-cdn.com\/entries\/icons\/original\/000\/004\/176\/big_claws.jpg","about_origin":"The meme is an exploitable, following a \"Well maybe I\/we could X if SOMEONE didn't have such BIG MEATY CLAWS\" line.","tags":"['mr krabs', 'spongebob memes', 'meaty claws', 'exploitable', 'snowclone', 'phrasal template', 'harold reginald']","year":2010.0,"last_update_source":"2021-01-05","other_types":"['snowclone']","imgflip":"[]"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-04-01T08:16:58.176185Z","updated_at":"2022-04-07T07:55:21.376502Z","project":1,"updated_by":2},{"id":321,"annotations":[{"id":286,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":25,"text":"Rocket Propelled Chainsaw","labels":["Meme"]},"id":"yTWAyX_lU2","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":41,"end":56,"text":"Rocket Chainsaw","labels":["Meme"]},"id":"UkLtuXXccx","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":61,"end":68,"text":"RPC M1B","labels":["Meme"]},"id":"ulgI7Xgaqt","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":124,"end":267,"text":"one of the most advanced and awesome lethal piece of equipment ever conceived by the internet, with maximum efficiency against zombie creatures","labels":["Meaning"]},"id":"MbH8t0yx9K","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-04-07T07:55:09.155144Z","updated_at":"2022-04-07T07:55:09.155181Z","lead_time":35.64,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":321,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"73735ef0-exploitable.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"url":"https:\/\/knowyourmeme.com\/memes\/rocket-propelled-chainsaw","template_image_url":"https:\/\/i.kym-cdn.com\/entries\/icons\/original\/000\/004\/142\/cover5.jpg","about_origin":"Rocket Propelled Chainsaw, also known as Rocket Chainsaw and RPC M1B, is a fictional weapon that gained legendary status as one of the most advanced and awesome lethal piece of equipment ever conceived by the internet, with maximum efficiency against zombie creatures.

Another commonly seen phrase comes from a viral video of CNN anchor Brooke Baldwin discussing the hack on her show where she asks, \"Who Is This 4 Chan?\" and is typically used to mock news outlets for their poor internet literacy. After the events of The Fappening, in which a hacker posted nude photographs of various celebrities onto 4chan, many news outlets rushed to report about the event, often without proper fact-checking.[1] One such report (which has since been taken down) from the Australian branch of MTV identified the hacker as \"a hacker known as 4 Chan,\" while the text in the article was changed to read \"A hacker, known only as a user of website '4 Chan,'\" later on, the original text read \"A hacker known as '4 Chan' claims to not only have nude, risqué images but explicit videos …\" (seen below). Due to the obvious error of identifying the hacker by the name of the site, many users on 4chan mocked the error by asking who 4chan was on the site itself. A similar event later occurred on CNN in a report about The Fappening where an interview with Brett Larson on Brooke Baldwin's show included the line, \"Who is this 4 Chan?\" The report was heavily mocked for little actual knowledge on technology and 4chan, receiving nearly 1.5 million views on CNN's YouTube[3] upload in six years (shown below).","tags":"['4chan', 'i am 4chan', 'who is this 4 chan', 'who is 4chan', 'i am the 4 chan', 'hacker known as 4 chan', 'fappening', 'celebgate', 'meme', 'hacker', 'hacking', 'cnn']","year":2014.0,"last_update_source":"2021-05-04","other_types":"['catchphrase', 'parody', 'viral-video']","imgflip":"[]"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-04-01T08:16:58.174425Z","updated_at":"2022-04-07T07:44:21.995430Z","project":1,"updated_by":2},{"id":276,"annotations":[{"id":265,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":27,"text":"\"Coincidence?

Since surfacing on Tumblr in June 2013, the illustration has been parodied with dozens of characters from other well-known fictional universes, quite similar to the development of the \"It's Goofy Time\" parodies. On June 21st 2013, Tumblr user Juniorbizarre uploaded a hand-drawn parody comic as a tribute to Phineas and Ferb, directly photographed from the blogger's personal sketchbook. In the TV series, the older sister of the main characters, Cadance, tries to tell their mother of her brother's exploits, while in the fan comic many of the common features of episodes in the series are parodies or overblown.

Originally introduced during the American Revolution, the flag has since become associated with libertarianism and the Tea Party movement in the 21st century. The design originated in 1775 as one of the flags used by the American navy during its revolutionary war against the British Empire. The use of the snake as a symbol and metaphor was already popular at the time; an early example was a political cartoon, \"Join, or Die\",[2] created in the 1750s by Benjamin Franklin during the Seven Years' War (shown below). The cartoon featured the various states of the American colonies represented by the dismembered sections of a snake. The original design was likely first used by the Marines of the newly formed American navy, though the precise origin is unknown.[1] Colonel Christopher Gadsden, after whom the flag is named, saw the design and was so impressed by it that he ordered an official flag to be created with it.[3]","tags":"['flag', 'libertarianism', 'libertarian', 'tea party', 'motto', 'exploitable', 'american revolution', 'marines', 'military', 'politics', \"don't tread on me\", 'christopher gadsden', 'benjamin franklin']","year":1775.0,"last_update_source":"2021-05-08","other_types":"[]","imgflip":"[]"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-04-01T08:16:58.171181Z","updated_at":"2022-04-07T07:20:11.314396Z","project":1,"updated_by":2},{"id":239,"annotations":[{"id":232,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":23,"text":"\"Ew, I Stepped In Shit\"","labels":["Meme"]},"id":"YJ4-CH8AKV","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":37,"end":48,"text":"exploitable","labels":["MemeType"]},"id":"RZ-9ktL1Mf","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":59,"end":67,"text":"reaction","labels":["MemeType"]},"id":"sAAY69bbL5","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":83,"end":147,"text":"convey disgust or hate for a specific type of image, person, etc","labels":["Meaning"]},"id":"J5Gnq1ZBdN","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-04-07T07:19:35.438096Z","updated_at":"2022-04-07T07:19:35.438117Z","lead_time":16.829,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":239,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"73735ef0-exploitable.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"url":"https:\/\/knowyourmeme.com\/memes\/ew-i-stepped-in-shit","template_image_url":"https:\/\/i.kym-cdn.com\/entries\/icons\/original\/000\/019\/401\/Screenshot_(13).png","about_origin":"\"Ew, I Stepped In Shit\" refers to an exploitable comic and reaction image, used to convey disgust or hate for a specific type of image, person, etc. The image is usually used in the context of discussions of media like anime or video games, especially in regards to waifus, as a mutation of the “Your Waifu Is Shit!” meme.","tags":"['lolnein', 'comic', 'shit', 'reaction image', 'exploitable', \"things i don't like\", 'vincent kunert']","year":2013.0,"last_update_source":"2021-05-04","other_types":"[]","imgflip":"[]"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-04-01T08:16:58.171143Z","updated_at":"2022-04-07T07:19:35.495888Z","project":1,"updated_by":2},{"id":238,"annotations":[{"id":231,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":22,"text":"The Ol' Spicy Keychain","labels":["Meme"]},"id":"5FJSo19JlH","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":270,"end":281,"text":"exploitable","labels":["MemeType"]},"id":"4y5t9OGExH","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":336,"end":363,"text":"expressing their discontent","labels":["Meaning"]},"id":"IHefgKpLvR","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-04-07T07:19:17.547625Z","updated_at":"2022-04-07T07:19:17.547663Z","lead_time":25.031,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":238,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"73735ef0-exploitable.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"url":"https:\/\/knowyourmeme.com\/memes\/the-ol-spicy-keychain","template_image_url":"https:\/\/i.kym-cdn.com\/entries\/icons\/original\/000\/019\/491\/the_ol'_spicy_keychain.jpg","about_origin":"The Ol' Spicy Keychain is an illustration by comic artist Will Laren, which depicts a man holding a burning key chain while yelling at his brother for heating the metal in an oven, referring to the prank as \"the ol' spicy keychain.\" The original drawing has inspired an exploitable image series, featuring a variety of other characters expressing their discontent.

As such, tier lists have been met with negative reception by casual players, while experienced players argue that tiers do exist at the highest level of competitive play and that it would be impossible to perfectly balance a roster consisting of unique characters. Higher level players also state that tier lists do not apply to casual play. While these lists have likely existed prior to its posting, the earliest available list was posted on the video game Tekken resource website tekkenzaibatsu.com on March 25th 2005 by user Nothing (shown below).[1]","tags":"['tiers r 4 queers', 'tires don exits', 'video gaming', 'fgc', '4chan', 'fighting games', 'super smash bros', 'street fighter', 'yello river', 'scrumpulate.']","year":2005.0,"last_update_source":"2021-04-27","other_types":"[]","imgflip":"[]"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-04-01T08:16:58.169711Z","updated_at":"2022-04-06T11:20:20.833588Z","project":1,"updated_by":2},{"id":202,"annotations":[{"id":218,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":11,"text":"CountryLove","labels":["Meme"]},"id":"0cAL6exWUf","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":27,"end":39,"text":"exploitables","labels":["MemeType"]},"id":"tSGEYK9AsL","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":111,"end":184,"text":"represent humorous despictions of countries and ethnicities relationships","labels":["Meaning"]},"id":"itGCif6jXH","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-04-06T11:18:50.157734Z","updated_at":"2022-04-06T11:18:50.157774Z","lead_time":29.183,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":202,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"73735ef0-exploitable.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"url":"https:\/\/knowyourmeme.com\/memes\/countrylove","template_image_url":"https:\/\/i.kym-cdn.com\/entries\/icons\/original\/000\/020\/819\/1465224067384_2.png","about_origin":"CountryLove is a series of exploitables featuring two girls, one of them groping the other's breasts, usued to represent humorous despictions of countries and ethnicities relationships on several 4chan boards.

The original scene comes from the fifth episode of season 11 of The Simpsons titled \"E I E I (ANNOYED GRUNT),\" which aired on November 7th, 1999.[2] In the scene, Homer parks outside the titular farming supply store \"Sneed's Feed & Seed\" (underneath in parenthesis reads \"Formerly Chuck's\") before being berated by two men (seen below).[1] The first internet reference to Sneed's Feed & Seed comes from an episode capsule text document written on March 27th, 2000, by Benjamin Robinson on the Simpson's Archive[4] website (shown below). In the post, Robinson detailed the hidden innuendo in the title by pointing out the correlation of \"Sneed, feed and seed\" all ending with the suffix \"-eed,\" meaning Chuck's former ownership would imply the \"-uck\" suffix instead — leading to the store formerly being \"Chuck's Fuck & Suck\" if following the initial starting letters.","tags":"['image', 'shitpost', 'edit', 'comedy', 'humour', 'humor', 'the simpsons', 'dirty joke', 'adult joke', 'the simpsons dirty joke', 'adult humour', 'adult humor', 'sneed', 'feed', 'seed', \"chuck's fuck & suck\", 'trolling', 'bait', 'the simpsons shitposting', 'shitposting', 'benjamin robinson', 'ian m']","year":2000.0,"last_update_source":"2021-05-11","other_types":"['pop-culture-reference', 'photoshop', 'snowclone']","imgflip":"[]"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-04-01T08:16:58.163715Z","updated_at":"2022-04-06T09:14:32.949799Z","project":1,"updated_by":2},{"id":87,"annotations":[{"id":164,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":17,"text":"How to Make Sushi","labels":["Meme"]},"id":"bP0XBoi0a7","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":343,"end":354,"text":"exploitable","labels":["MemeType"]},"id":"NCu71ecyv_","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":179,"end":227,"text":"having an emotional meltdown in a fetal position","labels":["Meaning"]},"id":"Bhr2xF9-i1","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-04-06T09:13:54.807449Z","updated_at":"2022-04-06T09:13:54.807485Z","lead_time":30.094,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":87,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"73735ef0-exploitable.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"url":"https:\/\/knowyourmeme.com\/memes\/how-to-make-sushi","template_image_url":"https:\/\/i.kym-cdn.com\/entries\/icons\/original\/000\/022\/113\/up_load_this.png","about_origin":"How to Make Sushi is webcomic by Spanish cartoonist Molg H. that seeming begins as a do-it-yourself illustration on how to make sushi rolls at home but ends up with the character having an emotional meltdown in a fetal position after failing to keep the roll together as instructed.

The dilemma was translated into a popular comic drawing, which then became an exploitable in online forums. The Trolley Problem thought experiment was first introduced by Philippa Foot in 1967. In this experiment, a trolley theoretically approaches five people tied down to a set of tracks. Using a lever, the trolley can be diverted to a different set of tracks, where only one person is tied down; a person could either allow the trolley to kill five people or divert it to kill one. The Trolley Problem is frequently discussed in military circles to metaphorically address issues of population targeting. The exploitable comic was originally drawn and posted by philosophy professor Jesse Prinz on his site subcortex.com[1] sometime before 2009.

This technique appeared in the manga's first issue, in which the artists depict sound through expressive typography within the illustration (shown below, left). Variations of the \"ゴゴゴゴ\" begin appearing as early as issue three, released on January 13th, 1987 (shown below, right).","tags":"['jojo', 'anime', 'manga', 'spooky', 'menacing', 'kanji', 'katakana']","year":2014.0,"last_update_source":"2021-04-30","other_types":"[]","imgflip":"[]"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-04-01T08:16:58.170163Z","updated_at":"2022-04-05T13:54:05.967277Z","project":1,"updated_by":2},{"id":214,"annotations":[{"id":145,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":22,"text":"Bubbles' \"No Me Gusta\"","labels":["Meme"]},"id":"Vntl2ua2t9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":342,"end":353,"text":"exploitable","labels":["MemeType"]},"id":"r2jpEtB_iU","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":88,"end":208,"text":"Bubbles, one of the protagonists, utters the phrase \"no me gusta\" while with a facial expression remsembling the NO face","labels":["Meaning"]},"id":"_aqDMm9YO0","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-04-05T13:53:12.127134Z","updated_at":"2022-04-05T13:53:12.127172Z","lead_time":58.393,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":214,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"73735ef0-exploitable.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"url":"https:\/\/knowyourmeme.com\/memes\/bubbles-no-me-gusta","template_image_url":"https:\/\/i.kym-cdn.com\/entries\/icons\/original\/000\/020\/368\/ss_(2016-04-26_at_12.04.59).jpg","about_origin":"Bubbles' \"No Me Gusta\" refers to a scene from an episode of The Powerpuff Girls wherein Bubbles, one of the protagonists, utters the phrase \"no me gusta\" while with a facial expression remsembling the NO face. Upon its airing in late April 2016, the scene drew criticism from the fans for incorporating outdated memes, as well as spawning an exploitable meme based on a blank template of Bubble's face. The scene was originally featured in the 11th episode of Cartoon Network's Powerpuff Girls titled Tiara Trouble[1], which aired on April 15th, 2016. In the episode, Bubbles gets groomed by her sisters Blossom and Buttercup for Townsville's beauty pageant, but amidst the growing pressures from her sisters to win the contest, Bubbles refuses to go along with their plan and yells \"no me gusta!\" with a look that resembles the \"NO\" face, both of which are well-known instances of the rage comic memeplex. That same day, YouTuber DiscordDiscord uploaded a clip of the scene, garnering over 150,000 views and more than 4,100 dislikes (as of April 26th, 2016). Following the airing of the episode, the scene quickly prompted backlash from some fans who apparently misinterpreted Bubbles' face as an anti-semitic caricature due to its depiction of a prominent nose, as well as some meme elitists who criticized the production team's appropriation of Internet meme culture and the incongruous pairing of the phrase \"no me gusta\" and Bubble's \"NO\" facial expression, which are considered two distinct memes within the rage comic universe (show below, right).","tags":"['ppg', 'photoshop', 'reboot', 'bubbles', 'exploitable', 'me gusta', 'no', 'rage comic', 'the powerpuff girls', 'memeplex', 'discorddiscord', 'men_cant_be_raped', 'sym-pho-geah']","year":2016.0,"last_update_source":"2021-04-18","other_types":"[]","imgflip":"[]"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-04-01T08:16:58.170126Z","updated_at":"2022-04-05T13:53:12.180014Z","project":1,"updated_by":2},{"id":213,"annotations":[{"id":144,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":12,"text":"Wheeze Comic","labels":["Meme"]},"id":"4AuMJbbPla","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":19,"end":30,"text":"exploitable","labels":["MemeType"]},"id":"yJXAkF6gB8","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":53,"end":96,"text":"satirize the ridiculousness of meme-culture","labels":["Meaning"]},"id":"g-h7Hn5cdE","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-04-05T13:52:12.274554Z","updated_at":"2022-04-05T13:52:12.274597Z","lead_time":23.608,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":213,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"73735ef0-exploitable.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"url":"https:\/\/knowyourmeme.com\/memes\/wheeze-comic","template_image_url":"https:\/\/i.kym-cdn.com\/entries\/icons\/original\/000\/020\/385\/xFxMbYh.png","about_origin":"Wheeze Comic is an exploitable comic format meant to satirize the ridiculousness of meme-culture.

In September 2020, a remixed version of the clip became a trending song known as “M to the Gary” on TikTok. The original clip that the meme is pulled from is seen during season two, episode 24 called “Dying for Pie,” which was released on January 27th, 2001. During the scene (featured below), Squidward is arguing with SpongeBob over the fact that he spent the entire day with him attempting to be nice because he expected him to explode. Upon hearing this, SpongeBob mistakes his intent and says, “Okay, I’ll try,” before expressing intense rage as he says the line, “Gary, you are gonna finish your dessert, and you are gonna like it!” The first time the scene is used in a meme is unknown, but the earliest example appears online in a YouTube[1] video from Bassgenral uploaded on May 13th, 2007.

As a result it no longer shows up upon every refresh [citation needed]. On August 15th, 2017, the website KnowYourMeme updated to include the pop-up shown below.

Moreover, the ability to quicksave enables the player to repeatedly attempt something difficult from the same point. Online, people use \"Quicksave\" as a catchphrase to express that a dangerous and\/or ill-advised action is about to take place. In 1987, Nintendo introduced the saving feature with The Legend of Zelda. According to the website How to Geek:[10] The golden Legend of Zelda cartridge featured an internal battery that powered a small RAM chip which stored player progress. For the first time console gamers could save the game at any point and return to it later. Games were no longer limited to a race-to-the-finish style delivery. Because of this, the size of the in-game universe and the complexity of the game could be greatly expanded as the designers knew players would be able to complete the game over multiple sessions at their leisure. On April 30th, 2009, Urban Dictionary defined \"quick save\" as \"A method for instantly saving the state of a video game, designed for pussies who cannot beat the game without cheating.\"[6] On July 8th, 2016, Redditor Coryan posted \"'I'd better save first' is often the gamer's version of 'hold my beer'\" in the \/r\/Showerthoughts subreddit, receiving more than 3,100 points (93% upvoted) and 45 comments.[8] Several months later, on December 29th, Redditor hesinthetrees posted \"Quicksaving is like the gaming equivalent of 'Hold my beer'\" to the \/r\/Showerthoughts subreddit.[7] The post recieved more than 150 points (91% upvoted).","tags":"['video games', 'quicksave', 'skyrim', 'gamer', 'ps4', 'xbox']","year":2017.0,"last_update_source":"2021-04-26","other_types":"[]","imgflip":"[]"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-04-01T08:16:58.162460Z","updated_at":"2022-04-05T11:07:46.753450Z","project":1,"updated_by":2},{"id":91,"annotations":[{"id":82,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":19,"text":"C'mon, Do Something","labels":["Meme"]},"id":"8wbjs1CE9l","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":53,"end":64,"text":"exploitable","labels":["MemeType"]},"id":"phGoj4EMWd","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":140,"end":183,"text":"pokes a variety of things with a long stick","labels":["Meaning"]},"id":"qhkiVw4aPj","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-04-05T11:06:44.980168Z","updated_at":"2022-04-05T11:06:44.980194Z","lead_time":21.472,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":91,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"73735ef0-exploitable.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"url":"https:\/\/knowyourmeme.com\/memes\/cmon-do-something","template_image_url":"https:\/\/i.kym-cdn.com\/entries\/icons\/original\/000\/022\/747\/download.jpg","about_origin":"C'mon, Do Something is a photoshop meme featuring an exploitable illustration from the webcomic White Ninja, in which the titular character pokes a variety of things with a long stick.

On April 14th, 2016, the French riot police force Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité (CRS) clashed against hundreds of angry demonstrators in Paris during a violent street protest against the French government's proposed labor code reform. As the riot police officers of the CRS began advancing towards the crowd to disperse the demonstration, which included use of canned tear gas, a female customer at a nearby café approached the police force and confronted them for using excessive force.

In recent years, it has been used as a joke among the gaming community, often mocking special crossovers or editions of games, similar to Featuring Dante from the Devil May Cry Series. In memes, & Knuckles is used as an exploitable by photoshopping various elements of the character or title into other pop culture references where Knuckles is a featured guest to create a parody. Sonic & Knuckles is a 1994 installment of the Sonic the Hedgehog series featuring Sonic the Hedgehog and the then-newly-playable Knuckles the Echidna.[1] The game was advertised for its \"Lock-On Technology,\" which in practice meant the physical game cartridge could be connected with other Sega Genesis games, most notably Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and Sonic the Hedgehog 3, with varying results. Combining the cartridge with Sonic the Hedgehog 3 formed a new compiled game called Sonic the Hedgehog 3 & Knuckles, which tied the stories of both games into a single saga as the developers originally intended. In addition, combining the cartridge with Sonic the Hedgehog 2 formed Knuckles the Echidna in Sonic the Hedgehog 2, a simple modification whereby the player could play through the story of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 as Knuckles.","tags":"['video game', 'sonic the hedgehog', 'knuckles the echidna', 'and knuckles', 'somecallmejohnny', 'narcissexual', 'douknogreg', 'sonic & knuckles', 'gaming', 'exploitable', 'parody', 'photoshop', 'pop culture']","year":2014.0,"last_update_source":"2021-04-25","other_types":"['parody', 'photoshop', 'pop-culture-reference']","imgflip":"[]"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-04-01T08:16:58.161505Z","updated_at":"2022-04-05T10:55:24.557256Z","project":1,"updated_by":2},{"id":71,"annotations":[{"id":66,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":22,"text":"Disappointed Black Guy","labels":["Meme"]},"id":"wItFg3JnYU","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":39,"end":47,"text":"reaction","labels":["MemeType"]},"id":"qeK0SsimRk","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":437,"end":460,"text":"disappointment or shock","labels":["Meaning"]},"id":"3tpYtJV0Ko","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-04-05T10:54:37.671734Z","updated_at":"2022-04-05T10:54:37.671767Z","lead_time":56.828,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":71,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"73735ef0-exploitable.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"url":"https:\/\/knowyourmeme.com\/memes\/disappointed-black-guy","template_image_url":"https:\/\/i.kym-cdn.com\/entries\/icons\/original\/000\/012\/175\/dissapointed.jpg","about_origin":"Disappointed Black Guy is a four-panel reaction image macro that expresses the expectation-reality meme.

Styled by James Valerie, the white clothing in the spread was supposedly meant to represent his unbelievable and unimaginable good fortune throughout his life. Bryant himself commented on the clothing during a pre-photo shoot interview with LA Times writer Tom Murray: Tom Murray: I have to ask, when you’re in that chopper, do you ever look down on the city, pinch yourself and say-- Kobe Bryant: How the hell did this happen?

The photographs of Jobs and Gates having a conversation were taken during a panel session hosted by All Things Digital[1] co-executive editors Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher at the D: All Things Digital conference (D5) on May 31st, 2007. The interview session focused on how Microsoft and Apple came to be some of the most influential companies and most well-known corporate rivals in the world. The iconic photograph of Gates and Jobs laughing together was taken by Joi Ito[2] and uploaded via Flickr later that same day.

When they were denied access, the protestors sat in front of the main gate in protest. Approximately 75 pro-war supporters came to the factory with signs discouraging the sit-in.

In George R. R.

It was also used in the HBO series Game of Thrones as the title of the pilot episode, which aired on April 17th, 2011, as well as for several promotional trailers and posters. An image macro featuring a photo of an owl and the phrase \"winter is coming\" (shown below, left) was submitted to Quickmeme[1] in July 2011, but the phrase didn't take off until it was paired with an HBO promotional portrait of Ned Stark (played by Sean Bean) later in August that year.

One such early example was posted on April 5th, 2004, in a thread on the My350Z[1] forums by user 12SecZ, who used the phrasal template alongside emoticons to show their reaction (seen below, left).

The memetic phrase was turned into a series of MS Paint comics on 4chan in which these players interrupt other events. The phrase is commonly edited through the snowclone \"No X, Y Only, Final Destination!\" In competitive Super Smash Bros. Melee, common tournament tier lists regularly rank the character Fox McCloud as the top rank, currently occupying his own special rank of SS over the 25 other characters.[1] This is commonly attributed to Fox's high levels of versatility and speed, and is commonly proven to be a \"jack of all trades, master of many.\" This makes Fox a very popular character among tournament players, making high level tournament play include an overabundance of Fox, oftentimes creating an impression that Fox is the only character allowed to be played. In competitive tournament play, the focus on skill over random chance and environmental exploitation oftentimes leads players to turn off randomly spawning items and impose self restrictions on many stages that provide any form of significant hazard banned from being played at events due to the unbalanced nature of the game. One of the most balanced stages in the game is Final Destination, which is simply a flat panel.

The meme originates from a viral YTMND page of the King from Burger King advertisements in the 2000s. The phrase has also been repurposed as the \"Where Is Your X Now?\" snowclone. The slightly altered version of the phrase appears in verse 7:10 of the Book of Micah of the Old Testament (seen below).[1] Then my enemy will see, and shame will cover her who said to me, “Where is the LORD your God?” My eyes will look upon her; now she will be trampled down like the mire of the streets. The phrase \"Where Is the Lord your God?\" is generally interpreted as \"the enemy\" (the Chaldean) luring the city of Jerusalem into questioning its faith in Jehovah when Jehovah did not aid the city as it was attacked by the Chaldeans.[2][3] Versions of the phrase also appear in the Bible, in Torah and in a number of Psalms, typically said by Israel's enemies to the people of Israel about their God (shown below).[4] My tears have been my food day and night, while they continually say to me, “Where is your God?” (Psalm 42:1-3) He will say: Where are their gods, their rock in whom they trusted, which ate the fat of their sacrifices and drank the wine of their drink offerings? (Deuteronomy 32:36-38) In October 2004, a Burger King commercial called \"Wake Up for With Burger King\" premiered in the U.S. (shown below). In the commercial, a man wakes up to find The Burger King lying next to him and staring at him. On March 28th, 2005, YTMBD[5] user ilpadrino created a YTMND titled \"WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW?\" that featured a still image of The Burger King staring at the man, captioned with the phrase. The page received nearly 80,000 views in 16 years (still image shown below).","tags":"['catchphrase', 'where is your god now', 'snowclone', 'bible', 'demotivational poster', 'god', 'phrase', 'ytmnd']","year":2005,"last_update_source":"2021-05-09","other_types":"['catchphrase']","imgflip":"[]"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-30T11:25:16.314705Z","updated_at":"2022-04-01T08:09:21.884594Z","project":1,"updated_by":2},{"id":49,"annotations":[{"id":48,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":22,"text":"But Can It Run Crysis?","labels":["Meme"]},"id":"xe9avnpM3L","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":93,"end":177,"text":"underscoring the reputation the game has obtained for it's steep system requirements","labels":["Meaning"]},"id":"7ciP4eW5_S","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":243,"end":252,"text":"snowclone","labels":["MemeType"]},"id":"aSiBaO5NkF","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":210,"end":216,"text":"phrase","labels":["MemeType"]},"id":"GlRu-wbU7-","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-04-01T08:08:38.505028Z","updated_at":"2022-04-01T08:08:38.505068Z","lead_time":38.876,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":49,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"dcf7c9c0-snowclone-2.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"url":"https:\/\/knowyourmeme.com\/memes\/but-can-it-run-crysis","template_image_url":"https:\/\/i.kym-cdn.com\/entries\/icons\/original\/000\/002\/038\/maxresdefault.jpg","about_origin":"But Can It Run Crysis? is a phrase referring to the 2007 Crytek first-person shooter Crysis, underscoring the reputation the game has obtained for it's steep system requirements at the time of its release. The phrase has slowly evolved into a snowclone as years pass, substituting \"But can it run X?\" for the most recent and system-demanding title at the time. Crysis was released on November 13th, 2007[1] by Crytek and Electronic Arts, and was developed on the (then) latest version of the CryEngine, which also powered Crytek's first title, FarCry. It was amongst the first games to ever utilize Microsoft's DirectX 10 API framework, which required Windows Vista or later. Other feats prided by the Crytek developers was the game being created with over 1 million lines of code, utilization of over 1 GB of texture data, and up to 85,000 active shaders. Since it's release, Crysis has received universal acclaim, hailing it as the first true next-gen gaming experience, with a Metacritic[2] aggregated score of 91 and multiple game of the year awards.   One of the earliest uses of the phrase comes from the bit-tech.net[3] article on the game posted December 15th, 2009, stating that \"The question 'Yeah, but can it play Crysis?' [has become] a comical catchphrase addition to most graphics card reviews.\" The article also questions the necessity of such taxing features on the game at release, and if this was a step in the right direction for gaming.","tags":"['video games', 'crysis', 'crytek', 'electronic arts', 'first person shooter', 'graphics', 'pc']","year":2007,"last_update_source":"2021-04-04","other_types":"['catchphrase', 'pop-culture-reference']","imgflip":"[]"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-30T11:25:16.314665Z","updated_at":"2022-04-01T08:08:38.552109Z","project":1,"updated_by":2},{"id":48,"annotations":[{"id":47,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":67,"text":"I'm Commander Shepard, and This Is My Favorite Store on the Citadel","labels":["Meme"]},"id":"I4EAkv2CLt","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":272,"end":283,"text":"catchphrase","labels":["MemeType"]},"id":"T4IBYH9i6W","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":315,"end":326,"text":"image macro","labels":["MemeType"]},"id":"eSq_QXw8Ev","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":332,"end":341,"text":"snowclone","labels":["MemeType"]},"id":"c5zRbeVixJ","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":942,"end":1022,"text":"humorously making it appear as if Shepard endorses every store as their favorite","labels":["Meaning"]},"id":"O74YmmLvn0","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-04-01T08:07:58.669227Z","updated_at":"2022-04-01T08:07:58.669278Z","lead_time":52.872,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":48,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"dcf7c9c0-snowclone-2.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"url":"https:\/\/knowyourmeme.com\/memes\/im-commander-shepard","template_image_url":"https:\/\/i.kym-cdn.com\/entries\/icons\/original\/000\/002\/105\/shepcover.jpg","about_origin":"I'm Commander Shepard, and This Is My Favorite Store on the Citadel is a popular line of dialogue spoken by Commander Shepard in the 2010 Bioware video game Mass Effect 2 when giving an endorsement to an in-game store in exchange for a discount.

On January 18th, 1969, episode 19 \"To Cage a Spider\" of season two of the 1967 series Spider-Man, colloquially known as 60's Spider-Man, premiered.[3] In one scene of the episode, Spider-Man is shown lying on a sickbed at a hospital. Starting at least as early as November 2007, the word \"cancer\" has been used as a metaphor for poor quality content on 4chan's \/b\/ and other boards. The spread of the word is mostly associated with the popularization of the phrase The Cancer That Is Killing \/b\/. In April 2009, Marvel started streaming episodes of 60's Spider-Man. In the following months, the show gained viral popularity among users on 4chan's \/co\/ board, with users posting threads with still images from the show, with users also making image macros based on it. In one of such threads, an anonymous user created an image macro based a still image of Spider-Man lying sick in bed from the episode \"To Cage a Spider\" of the series, captioning it \"That Post Gave Me Cancer\" (shown below). The earliest found reposts of the image were made by an anonymous JoyReactor[1] user on March 30th, 2010, and on 4chan image mirror website Chan4Chan[2] on November 30th, 2010.

In the film, the child protagonist Cole Sear (played by Haley Joel Osment) can be heard uttering the line before Dr. Malcolm Crowe (played by Bruce Willis) to reveal that he can see ghosts. The quote was also prominently featured in a number of promotional clips and official teaser trailers. It was parodied in the 2000 horror spoof film Scary Movie[13] (shown below, right) after the character Shorty (played by Marlon Wayans) smokes too much marijuana.

The quote is often used by Joseph as part of his cleverness to predict what his opponents are about to say next. Online, the quote has become a popular form of shitposting in the JoJo fandom where a user would write in a sentence that other users are about to say and those who participate would repeat the sentence followed by showing a sense of shock or confusion in their reply, thus prompting the snowclone Your Next Line is X. This quote originated from the second story arc of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure titled Battle Tendency which was published from 1988 to 1989. The quote made its first appearance in the 47th chapter of the manga titled Sad News. In the chapter, Joseph engages battle against a thug who was harassing his friend. Among the tactics he used, Joseph predicted what the thug was about to say next, prompting him to be shocked and confused (shown below).

The scene comes from Hunter x Hunter's chapter 357 of the manga, released on June 13th, 2016. The chapter covers the conclusion of the fight between characters Chrollo Lucifer and Hisoka Morow, with Hisoka losing the battle after Chrollo blows him up with his ability. After being confirmed dead by a group of characters, Hisoka suddenly wakes up and explains character Machi that he survived by using his nen (energy that exists in the Hunter x Hunter universe and grants different abilities), injecting gum on his heart and lungs to restart them. The catchphrase can be seen on the fan scanlation from Mangastream, in a flashback describing the events right before his death, where he orders his nen to resurrect him after his death.","tags":"['hunter x hunter', 'rubber nen', 'gum nen', 'o my', 'hisoka', 'properties of both rubber and gum', 'hxh', 'hisoka morrow']","year":2016,"last_update_source":"2020-09-18","other_types":"['catchphrase', 'copypasta', 'pop-culture-reference']","imgflip":"[]"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-30T11:25:16.313420Z","updated_at":"2022-04-01T07:19:29.094568Z","project":1,"updated_by":2},{"id":15,"annotations":[{"id":16,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":35,"text":"I Showed You My Dick Please Respond","labels":["Meme"]},"id":"aqeJ8YTLOz","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":176,"end":269,"text":"implying that they've recently sent a picture of their penis to a woman and are being ignored","labels":["Meaning"]},"id":"OitdcMIEUk","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":316,"end":325,"text":"snowclone","labels":["MemeType"]},"id":"B4VTLmLAzk","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-04-01T07:18:54.784601Z","updated_at":"2022-04-01T07:18:54.784644Z","lead_time":34.554,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":15,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"dcf7c9c0-snowclone-2.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"url":"https:\/\/knowyourmeme.com\/memes\/i-showed-you-my-dick-please-respond","template_image_url":"https:\/\/i.kym-cdn.com\/entries\/icons\/original\/000\/023\/422\/Screen_Shot_2017-07-14_at_10.20.17_AM.jpg","about_origin":"I Showed You My Dick Please Respond refers to several snapchat-style images of unattractive boys with a variation of the text \"I showed you my dick, please respond\" over them, implying that they've recently sent a picture of their penis to a woman and are being ignored.

The questionable validity of the punchline and confusing nature of the joke's structure has turned it into a tool for trolling and memes referencing the original quip, which uses the scene from the show as an exploitable in photoshops and other edits. After spreading to 4chan, \"Sneedposting\" became a widespread shitposting format to reference Sneed's Feed & Seed. The original scene comes from the fifth episode of season 11 of The Simpsons titled \"E I E I (ANNOYED GRUNT),\" which aired on November 7th, 1999.[2] In the scene, Homer parks outside the titular farming supply store \"Sneed's Feed & Seed\" (underneath in parenthesis reads \"Formerly Chuck's\") before being berated by two men (seen below).[1] The first internet reference to Sneed's Feed & Seed comes from an episode capsule text document written on March 27th, 2000, by Benjamin Robinson on the Simpson's Archive[4] website (shown below). In the post, Robinson detailed the hidden innuendo in the title by pointing out the correlation of \"Sneed, feed and seed\" all ending with the suffix \"-eed,\" meaning Chuck's former ownership would imply the \"-uck\" suffix instead — leading to the store formerly being \"Chuck's Fuck & Suck\" if following the initial starting letters.","tags":"['image', 'shitpost', 'edit', 'comedy', 'humour', 'humor', 'the simpsons', 'dirty joke', 'adult joke', 'the simpsons dirty joke', 'adult humour', 'adult humor', 'sneed', 'feed', 'seed', \"chuck's fuck & suck\", 'trolling', 'bait', 'the simpsons shitposting', 'shitposting', 'benjamin robinson', 'ian m']","year":2000,"last_update_source":"2021-05-11","other_types":"['pop-culture-reference', 'exploitable', 'photoshop']","imgflip":"[]"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-30T11:25:16.313234Z","updated_at":"2022-04-01T07:15:53.058041Z","project":1,"updated_by":2},{"id":10,"annotations":[{"id":11,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":31,"text":"\"I'm a Man \/ Woman Looking For\"","labels":["Meme"]},"id":"E0fRt44KV8","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":47,"end":55,"text":"\"I Am A\"","labels":["Meme"]},"id":"TDyCVnHF6Z","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":70,"end":81,"text":"exploitable","labels":["MemeType"]},"id":"v38J2fzqnm","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":121,"end":257,"text":"people specify their gender and a humorous response to what they look for in a romantic partner, parodying the format of a dating survey","labels":["Meaning"]},"id":"MIFCMkZNiG","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-04-01T07:13:38.847479Z","updated_at":"2022-04-01T07:13:38.847521Z","lead_time":54.705,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":10,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"dcf7c9c0-snowclone-2.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"url":"https:\/\/knowyourmeme.com\/memes\/im-a-man-woman-looking-for","template_image_url":"https:\/\/i.kym-cdn.com\/entries\/icons\/original\/000\/023\/730\/iama.jpg","about_origin":"\"I'm a Man \/ Woman Looking For\", also known as \"I Am A\", refers to an exploitable questionnaire used on Twitter in which people specify their gender and a humorous response to what they look for in a romantic partner, parodying the format of a dating survey.
